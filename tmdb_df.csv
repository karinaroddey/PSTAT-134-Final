58,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,8.0,Part 2 introduces Davy Jones. Jack Sparrow has owed Davy a debt. Now Davy intends to make Jack make good on that debt. One way or another. Really awesome sequel.
59,A History of Violence,7.0,"Probably Cronenberg's most mundane work, but that's not even remotely a knock against _A History of Violence_. I hear tell that fans of the comic don't much like this big screen re-telling, but I've never read it, so I'm gonna go ahead and really enjoy it anyway.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
62,2001: A Space Odyssey,8.0,"I believe that we should call it a modernism show, albeit exhibited in the form of a movie. While it might feel ""boring"", it forces you to rethink what philosophical level that a two-hour film can achieve. The focus on questions about life, intelligence, and time, is worth more attention than the sci-fi part (though the special effect of this movie is already way ahead of its time)."
62,2001: A Space Odyssey,10.0,"The eighth wonder of the world. Easily 30+ viewings since I was a little kid. Nothing new to say here; simply wanted to add another pair of hands to the ocean of applause for my absolute favorite thing, the only indisputably perfect movie, the answer to the question of Is Life Worth Living, Man's greatest achievement, two thousand one a burger-flipping space odyssey"
62,2001: A Space Odyssey,10.0,"Absolute classic, must see, one of the best scifi movies ever made"
63,Twelve Monkeys,8.0,"Really good sci-fi thriller with wonderful performances by Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe and Brad Pitt. Really well done by director Terry Gilliam that has great pacing through the two hour running time. **4.0/5**"
64,Talk to Her,8.0,"Now this is…really something different like the story and Benigno. I know what he did was so so wrong but I felt bad for him. Such a heartbreaking story and I love how the friendship was formed, although I really didn’t care about the writer and matador. I just couldn’t stop watching this film when I saw it on Sundance, until the ending, like the butt shakin partner dance before the end credits. It may be the music. And of course…Paz Vega’s black and white silent film, the shrinking man who went inside her…literally!"
65,8 Mile,6.0,Eminem turned out to be a pretty decent actor. I love battle raps. Honestly he's one of if not the best to ever do it!
68,Brazil,10.0,"One of my all time favourite sci fi movies. Set the bench mark for modern sci fi, should be considered a great like Blade Runner.
Great acting, story, soundtrack! 5/5"
73,American History X,9.0,"Despite having a somewhat weak cast, this is an incredibly poignant drama of one man's struggle to live a new life. Probably too violent and close-to-home for some."
73,American History X,5.0,There's really no point to the movie. Just a lot of violence. That's pretty much it.
74,War of the Worlds,5.0,"First time seeing this in 15 years and lame plot, annoying characters (both kids got on my nerves) and a protagonist who just runs around, as Tom Cruise does so well, but has zero impact on the end game which was... bacteria. Yeah, this was just as dumb today as it was back then. At least the visual effects and sound design still holds up. **2.5/5**"
74,War of the Worlds,8.0,"An intense, serious and harrowing portrayal of the H.G. Wells classic. Tom Cruise doing an excellent job of not being Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning out acting everyone. It's hard to call this film an enjoyable watch as it's actually emotionally affecting at times, with some very raw realism concerning human nature. This movie manages to keep a constantly high pace without being exhausting to watch. Well worth a place in your collection."
77,Memento,10.0,"Excellent. I can't believe I've finally gotten around to watching all of Christopher Nolan's films (I have 'The Prestige' on DVD, but have yet to see it), but it's been well worth the wait. There are a couple of handful of English-language directors operating right now that I will make sure I watch every single film of, and Nolan has become one of those for me, and rightfully so. A very fine twist on the noir framework."
77,Memento,8.0,"Structuring the film in such a way that the viewer knows as little as the protagonist, the Nolan's have created a nifty puzzle that slowly unravels to its climax.

8/10"
77,Memento,7.0,"A similar style to Inception, pay attention or you’ll lose it"
78,Blade Runner,8.0,"Some people will say this classic sci-fi ""has nothing to offer other than overrated cult-status"". To that, I would respond, ""it has Rutger Hauer on a rooftop, and that's enough for me"".

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._

(3.5 for the Theatrical Cut, 4.0 for the Final Cut)"
82,Miami Vice,8.0,"This is one I saw back in theaters and don't remember caring much for perhaps due to the stark shift in direction with the digital format and over-saturation (compare that to Heat) but seems like the 16 years since, not only with Mann's Collateral, but other films have adopted something similar, that this time around it didn't look or feel off. As for the movie itself, solid storyline and the performances from Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell were really good, now I wish there was a sequel but that time has passed unless Universal goes the streaming route. **4.0/5**"
83,Open Water,3.0,"If you like Extreme EXTREME Close Ups filmed on an iPod Shuffle, then oo boy do I have the film for you.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
85,Raiders of the Lost Ark,10.0,"5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

My favorite action film of all time due to one of the most iconic death scenes at the end being my personal favorite and being featured in my melt movie lists on many different websites!!!"
87,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,5.0,"Simultaneously both more grim and more silly than the Indiana Jones films either side of it, _The Temple of Doom_ was my favourite of the series as a kid. As an adult though, it seems it is objectively the worst movie in the trilogy, but damn if there isn't a lot of memorable parts to love about it.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
88,Dirty Dancing,7.0,"A pretty simplistic film with a plot that's more of an excuse to show dance scenes and an extremely surface level handling of the issues of gender and class that it raises, but it's pretty cute and also I'm bisexual so I like it anyway."
88,Dirty Dancing,6.0,An ok movie. A lot of cheesy parts that I didn't like. I did like the dancing and the love story. I guess it was better at that time.
89,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,7.0,"It feels very much a retread of _Raiders_. But, that was a great movie, so it's not exactly as if that's a bad plan.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
95,Armageddon,8.0,"Directed by Michael Bay, co-written by J.J. Abrams and starring Bruce Willis just being Bruce Willis while he saves the world from a giant asteroid with a proper bunch of misfits and some oil drilling equipment. I'm in!"
95,Armageddon,7.0,Another end of the world movie. Not really action more drama then anything. It's an unlikely team that saves the world.
96,Beverly Hills Cop II,7.0,"Entertaining enough sequel isn't as sharp as the original and some parts felt like Murphy's stand-up routine, and while the plot itself was weak, did enjoy the on-screen friendships between Murphy, Reinhold and Ashton. **3.5/5**"
98,Gladiator,8.0,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a real masterpiece of its genre. With its unique battle scenes, cinematography, acting and directing. It's a real must-watch. Shame on you if you haven't watched this movie!"
98,Gladiator,10.0,"An epic old movie, an absolute must watch. Even now, I can’t resist running my hands over tall plants whenever I pass by them"
99,All About My Mother,10.0,"Of course, it's an Almodovar, so it's already a great film. But this one - the artistic shots, the characters, the story, the humanity - all top notch. I think this film might be his best."
100,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels",3.0,"Far from being a good movie, with tons of flaws but already pointing to the pattern of the whole Ritchie's filmography."
100,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels",9.0,"Genuinely one of my favorite movies of all time. Watched again recently and realised how well written, brilliantly shot, beautifully cast and cleverly produced this movie actually is!"
101,Léon: The Professional,10.0,"HOW TO MAKE A FEMALE ASSASSIN. TRAUMA, TRAINING THEN GET HER EXTRA ANGRY.  NATILIE PORTMANS FIRST ASSASSIN ROLE AND HOPEFULLY NOT HER LAST.  WE NEED A PART 2 TO THIS MOVIE."
104,Run Lola Run,5.0,"Stupid criminal is stupid and expects his girlfriend to bail him out and fix his problems. We watch 3 different scenarios of her running around trying to come up with money. More stupid stuff happens and she screams to try to make things go her way. Yes, literally screams. Ridiculous"
105,Back to the Future,8.0,"**Entertaining**

A man goes back in time to save his mother - or something like that anyway - I was too entertained to fully grasp what was going on.  Seriously, this film moves so fast that you will find yourself having to try your hardest to keep up with it.

Great movie. Great soundtrack. Great performances. A shame that the sequels did not live up to this one. 

- Ian Beale"
105,Back to the Future,9.0,Not sure how many times I've seen this (first time was on VHS ~1986 or 87 I think) but still an incredibly fun sci-fi comedy with Fox and Lloyd working perfectly off one another. Holds up so well each and every time I re-visit. **4.5/5**
105,Back to the Future,6.0,Everyone who's ever seen this movie loves it. We all wish we could go back in time. I know I do.
105,Back to the Future,8.0,A quintasential '80s movie. A time-jumping rollercoaster ride everyone will enjoy getting on board.
105,Back to the Future,9.0,The first time I saw this movie I was 6 or 7 years old and my friend had it on VHS and since then I can't count the number of times I have seen it. Such a fun time travel adventure movie.
107,Snatch,10.0,"Peak cinema. I absolutely love this movie, this is a fast-paced, filled with jokes and charismatic characters rollercoaster that's definetely worth watching"
111,Scarface,9.0,"Immensely great crime-drama that features some great performances and excellent writing from Oliver Stone (and this coming from someone who isn't a big fan of his) to the direction by Brian De Palma. The score is great though still love the song ""Take It to the Limit"" during the money laundering scene. Still a few slots below the likes of The Godfather and Heat, yet still a amazing film that holds up so well. **4.5/5**"
114,Pretty Woman,7.0,"""You and I are such similar creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money.""

Richard Gere has always played a rich snob really well but I can't help shake the feeling that Julia Roberts was shockingly miscast in this role. She does well but the role just doesn't fit. Oh well, can't win them all."
114,Pretty Woman,6.0,"Pretty average movie. The dialog is maybe a bit ahead of its' time, in terms of toxicity and progressivism, but that's a few lines.
Feels really sappy and cardboard. The cast has great charisma, but they can't help playing cardboard in such a simple play. I'm not sure how exactly modern fairytales are made good, but most I've seen are better than this.

6/10"
115,The Big Lebowski,10.0,"Fun, clever and engaging. Joel & Eitan Cohen's most iconic creation"
116,Match Point,3.0,"_Match Point, or, Crime & Misdemeanors, Except I Changed Like 4 Things, And the Mistress is Really Hot This Time_"
118,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,7.0,Not as good as the original but still good nonetheless. Johnny Depp is really the only reason this movie was good. I think any other actor that would have played that character would have made the movie suck.
120,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10.0,"An epic movie if I ever saw one. Captivating and just plain fun to watch. This movie is, indeed, art."
120,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,9.0,"Lost count how many times I've seen the ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" but still fantastic after all these years, epic on every level and just all around entertaining, the 3.5 running time just flies by. Will be watching ""The Two Towers"" either tonight or tomorrow followed by ""The Return of the King"". **4.75/5**"
121,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,9.0,"Still probably my favorite of the three, while it's pretty streamlined and far more action centric with little development compared with Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King, I always find this one really entertaining with the Helm's Deep battle. **4.5/5**"
122,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10.0,"Great finale to a great trilogy. The action and battle sequences were amazing and even though I've seen this a few times over the years, still thrilling to the end. I didn't even mind the multiple endings as I had in the past, nice each character got their due. **4.75/5**"
128,Princess Mononoke,10.0,Probably the best movie from Miyazaki. A mixture of old Japanese traditions with the story about the conflict between the industrial human being and the preservation of the Nature.
128,Princess Mononoke,10.0,"Hayao Miyazaki's arts have always something to remember us that we are naturally harmonized with mother earth and existences. There is still a bond, if one is hurt another, it means the one suffer itself as well."
128,Princess Mononoke,9.0,This is my favorite movie from Miyazaki. The visuals are great. The characters are great. The voice acting (English version) is great. The animation is great. Music is great. The story is good. Everything about this movie is so cool and it's just really fun to watch.
129,Spirited Away,10.0,"One of the great ""masters"" of the anime art. Somehow, if I would personally associate ""Akira"" to ""self-destruction"", then this anime would be the opposite :)"
134,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",6.0,Weird convicts that escape. With no money they try to find treasure. Has some weird comedy as well. Good cast though.
135,Dont Look Back,9.0,"I'm a huge fan of both Bob Dylan and D.A. Pennebaker's documentaries, so to me, this was a no-brainer to watch, especially this vintage. I was fortunate to catch Dylan live, after his life-threatening bout of pericarditis, in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the Hill Auditorium with the Kenny Wayne Shepherd band as support, but how amazing it would have been to have caught him live on this British tour, from a generation earlier.

I would have given it a perfect rating, but I docked a mark for him making fun of Donovan, for crying out loud."
137,Groundhog Day,7.0,"Funny story done to fit on Bill Murray's shoes.

It is good enough and with a moral for the family but I don't get it what this is such a famous movie."
137,Groundhog Day,9.0,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.

Bill Murray carries this time-shift-loop adventure in hilarious form.  The writing is excellent with a ""redeemable protagonist"" trope mixed in.

The movie is creative with it's divergent time lines and even manages to maintain proper story arcs as Phil continues to loop.

The supporting cast is wonderful in each of their roles, and manage to do repeat acting excellently.

This was a popularizing (if not a birth) to a genre, everyone should have watched this movie at some point."
138,Dracula,8.0,"Probably my third or fourth time seeing this and while the story is simple, still really entertaining and Bela Lugosi, who even as a favorite of mine acknowledge was never the strongest actor, is in his element. Also has some decent effects and nice set design for the era. **4.0/5**"
138,Dracula,10.0,"""The blood is the life, Mr. REINFIELD""



At three years old this was my first horror movie. My great-grandmother is the one who sat me down and showed me great Bela Lugosi as Dracula. This entire movie is timeless and classic. The very best of all the Universal horrors.

No one could be a more perfect Dracula than Bela Lugosi. To accomplish so much with just a stare. No special effects. No fangs... yet he chilled you to the bone and enthralled all.

One of my all-time favorites. Classic Cinema perfection."
141,Donnie Darko,7.0,"Interesting movie with several readings.

As with 2001: A Space Odissey, it is needed a reading of the actual explanation for the events to fully understand the original idea ... if you are interested in such explanation ..."
141,Donnie Darko,9.0,"A complete mind-bender of a movie that put Jake Gyllenhall on the map, introduced the creepiest rabbit costume of all time, and may make you surprisingly tear up to a remake of Tears for Fears ""Mad World."""
143,All Quiet on the Western Front,9.0,"This very dark, intense film about the horror and brutality of war focuses on a group of young German soldiers fighting at the front during WWI.  It's brilliant, raw, and compellingly honest.  Lew Ayers, only 20 years old at the time, does a very fine job.  Based on Remarque's famous book, this is a classic, stunning piece of cinema, which earned Best Picture and Director Oscars.  The ending is haunting and very disturbing, and it will stay with you long afterward.

Would I recommend?  Yes, but for more mature audiences who can really take it in."
150,48 Hrs.,6.0,Entertaining buddy action-comedy that features a good antagonistic relationship between Nolte and Murphy. The plot isn't the strongest but the action/fight scenes were alright. **3.25/5**
150,48 Hrs.,6.0,Back to the old school. Love this movie. This is when cop movies started to have some comedy in it.
152,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,1.0,"BORING.

I mean, it opens great. The first few minutes sort of give you the impression that this movie is going to be epic...

... and then the rest of it is best spent looking at your phone, cleaning your finger nails, watching linoleum curl, defrosting your freezer...

... finding anything else you can do as it plays in the background just to keep you form dying of Boredom.

And I say this as a Star Trek fan."
153,Lost in Translation,10.0,"Lost in Translation is one of my all-time favorite movies. The film grabbed me when I first saw it in the theater (unusual for back then, but my cineplex got this one in) and since I've watched it dozens of times. Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson are both great and Sofia Coppola's direction taking in the sights and sounds of Tokyo (a city I've always been curious about and wanted to visit) was amazing."
155,The Dark Knight,10.0,"A Masterpiece!!! I Love how The Dark Knight shows to me the ""Dark & Gritty Tone"". Overall, Nolan give us the Game changing, best superhero film OF ALL TIME. For me it's 10/10"
155,The Dark Knight,10.0,"Unforgettable crime film with good dialogue, thrilling action and chase scenes and once again a magnificent cast (most notably a terrifically terrifying Ledger) and superb score.

10/10"
155,The Dark Knight,7.0,I enjoyed watching the Dark Knight. They were at least able to keep the same batman from the the last one made too.
155,The Dark Knight,8.0,If I can hold my pee for a whole two and a half hours rewatching a film I’ve already seen then I love it.
155,The Dark Knight,10.0,I'm deeply in romantical love with the joker. this movie made my delusions worse
157,Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,7.0,"I kind of feel that this gets a lot more hate than it deserves... because it follows Kahn and because it rewrites an emotional death.

I know, I know, I love Spock too, but, really, should have left him dead. That was part of the emotional roller coaster of II.

But, they didn't and that does sort of cheapen Kahn a bit.

However, it's really not a bad entry on it's own. It's a solid film. It just followed the greatest of the bunch and pales in comparison."
161,Ocean's Eleven,9.0,"_""Congratulations, you're a dead man.""_

I mean, this might be the best remake of all time right? I don't like using the term masterpiece but this is pretty close to that. Ensembles are not easy to do well but Soderbergh was able to get this group of beutiful people, make a charming picture and it's got everything you want in a heist movie."
161,Ocean's Eleven,9.0,"> ""Congratulations, you're a dead man.""

162,Edward Scissorhands,8.0,Love this movie. It's like a non evil Freddy Kruger. The ending could have been better though.
163,Ocean's Twelve,7.0,"> ""Come on, he's one guy, and he's French.""

Ocean's series goes global and I love it. The scenery, the music, the stellar cast... they did it again. I would say while this is about heists again, it doesn't focus on it as much, but I am cool with that because the storytelling, twists and cast are just so good."
165,Back to the Future Part II,8.0,"This was one I think I was slightly disappointed in when I first saw it in theaters back in '89 and even with subsequent viewings on VHS and DVD, however I've come to appreciate it more over the years post-2000s. Lots of fun though feels disjointed at times going back and forth in time from 1985 to 2015 to alternate 1985 and back to 1955. But I did like the technical aspects re-creating the events of the first movie. **4.0/5**

PS: Still remember back in the day seeing a TV special and believing the hoverboard was real, lol."
165,Back to the Future Part II,8.0,"My favorite out of the series. I like this one better, because your rewatching the 1st one as the 2nd one is helping the 1st one at the same time. So you get to enjoy the 1st one again with new twists added from the 2nd one. But you can't see yourself watching the 1st one while watching the 2nd one, because the 1st one is not suppose to see the 2nd one watching it, and vice versa. Otherwise something bad will happen if the 1st and 2nd one see each other. Lol you get what I'm saying!"
168,Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,1.0,"I guess when I was 6 i liked it, and every generation needs it's time travel movie doesn't it?

But, no, bringing them back to contemporary 80s earth just doesn't work. It's sort of too close to home to be good. Star Trek is Sci-Fi, sure, but this just doesn't work.

They live in a future that COULD be, with it's own history, it's own mythology, and taking the crew of the Enterprise back to our world just makes them feel more out of place than the comedic tone of the film intended."
170,28 Days Later,7.0,"**mild abstract spoiler ahead**

My feelings about this movie may very well be extended towards Boyle's movies in general : solid direction overall, but events did not fail to go from situational and behavioral realism to sudden heroical action nonsense."
170,28 Days Later,8.0,"_28 Days Later_ was made on a very small budget in the early days of digital cinema, so, yes, in retrospect, it does look a little bit like it was shot on a Nokia 3310, and yes, it is heavily responsible for the bilious deluge of zombie movies we got in its wake, which we are only now finally recovering from - but it's so **good**. 

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
175,The Big Blue,6.5,"Introspective story with a good Jean Reno and innocent Rosanna Arquette.

Sound track, for those loving Eric Sierra. Not for all tastes. A little bit too long but entartaining."
180,Minority Report,6.0,"Works more on the strength of Spielberg than of Cruise.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._"
180,Minority Report,8.0,Really good movie. This is one of those movies where you really gotta pay attention to it to understand it fully. Great storyline too. I'm sure our world will eventually end up this way. Hope not though!
183,The Wizard,5.0,"Has some heart at times, almost ruined by the blatant and, hate to use this word, cringe-worthy product placement from Hostess to Nintendo to Universal Studios (which makes sense since this was one of their movies). The acting and writing is bad and I'm not quite sure who this movie was made for (there is a joke about a teenage girl accusing a grown man of grabbing her breast) but there are some funny bad moments. **2.75/5**"
185,A Clockwork Orange,7.0,"Some great visuals and direction not to mention an incredible performance from Malcolm McDowell, I wasn't totally into this, the first half especially was taxing to get through to the point I stopped watching and only finished a couple days later. The rest was good and found myself a bit more engaged however as a whole, this one never grabbed me. **3.5/5**"
189,Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,6.0,"It's just not as good as the first. They over use colour, instead of tiny splashes here and there it's everywhere and it doesn't work

Eva Green is absolutely perfect as Ava, I just wish her story was in the first film"
192,The Name of the Rose,6.0,"At first I was like ""Hah, this is some kind of Sherlock Holmes but a priest thing!"", and then I was like ""Oh, this **is** some kind of Sherlock Holmes but a priest thing!""

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
193,Star Trek: Generations,1.0,"I'll be honest, I really hated Star Trek The Motion Picture. I mean, I REALLY hated it and I am a Star Trek fan...

... so it's sort of fitting that I hate Generations as well.

I mean, it doesn't do the first generation or the Next Generation justice at all does it? Kirk shouldn't have been in it. The OG Enterprise crew shouldn't have been in it.

It felt like it robbed TNG of their first outing on the big screen while insulting the original crew of the Enterprise."
193,Star Trek: Generations,6.0,"I've seen this one a few times over the years and while not great and the plot was something akin to a two-part episode of TNG, I still was mildly entertained even if Malcolm McDowell's role was underdeveloped with us being told of his motivations with the death of his family versus being shown it via flashbacks. But the selling point was seeing the two iconic Captains together, even if only for 25-minutes. **3.0/5**"
196,Back to the Future Part III,8.0,"As with Part II, I've come to appreciate this one more, a great blend of sci-fi and western and features once more some fine performances from both Fox and Lloyd, who each do great work portraying different characters (or at least for Lloyd a different time version of Doc Brown). Beyond that, well done set and costume designs and a good enough story to conclude the trilogy. **3.75/5**"
196,Back to the Future Part III,5.0,Not my favorite. I didn't really like the 3rd movie because I'm not really into western type movies.
196,Back to the Future Part III,4.0,"Maybe a little better than the second movie, but still not a patch on the first. It's worth a watch for the in-jokes but have a standby movie ready."
199,Star Trek: First Contact,8.0,"Really solid and suspense-filled Star Trek film. Seen this one once before and still holds up along with the visual effects which were decent for its time. This is also the first complete TNG feature and unlike Generations, did feel like a movie rather than two-part episode. 4.0/5"
204,The Wages of Fear,8.0,"It’s always my honour to write the first review for a film, especially ones like this. It, however, upsets me that not many have seen this magnificent and harrowing masterpiece."
207,Dead Poets Society,1.0,"The (very absurd) point of view of the rich people about freedom.

The Movie is so pathetically formulaic that it makes you want to throw tomatoes at the screen.

The Horatian ideal, of Stoic-Epicurean origin, of a life enjoyed in the good it gives us, even if it is little, is here often repeated, inaccurately, as an invitation to live joyfully.

And it makes us laugh and reflect even more that it is observed from an ""even higher"" point of view than the already very high social class of the characters."
213,North by Northwest,9.0,"I hate user/critic review websites strictly because of movies like this. People will go see like, Gran Torino, be entertained, admire a couple symmetrical shots and smooth camera pans or whatever, and rate the thing a 4.5/5, 9/10, 95%, etc. But then there are movies that have a ten minute chase scene with Cary Grant scaling down Mount Rushmore, every second of which you're screaming at the screen. Of course my most pompous entry is for an Alfred Hitchcock. But please, for progeny's sake, save the high ratings for ones that earn em"
213,North by Northwest,7.0,Not one time did I think “This is good enough to deserve being on his (Hitchcock’s) filmography.
213,North by Northwest,7.0,Not one time did I think “This is good enough to deserve being on his (Hitchcock’s) filmography.
213,North by Northwest,9.0,"Seen this one a few times over the years and still is one of Hitchcock's best though personally Rear Window is still my favorite of his. Still, a great espionage thriller with solid performances from both Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. **4.5/5**"
218,The Terminator,10.0,"""_It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!_""

What's there to say that hasn't been said already? It's an incredible sci-fi thriller that is so good because not only is the story fun, but Cameron makes it look so good even back then before he blew up. Arnold is terrifying, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were meant to be and the score gives me chills."
223,Rebecca,8.0,A good movie and interesting plot but the characters are a little bit exaggerated and the outcome is quite expectable.
235,Stand by Me,10.0,"My all-time favourite movie! Like Gordie, I was a shy, sensitive boy, who was (and am) a writer, and I've been told by so many people I have a talent for it. Also, I've had many friends like Chris, being tough on the outside, while sweet on the inside, and I've known people like Vern, Teddy and Denny too :) Beautiful music, acting and truth about growing up, as relevant today as it was in the 80s/50s :) <3"
235,Stand by Me,8.0,"Ok everyone - this is a 80's kid about kids, but don't think it is like the others as it is a Stephen King adaptation. It isn't for kids - unless you want to traumatize them.

Coming of age at a high price, what makes this a special one on that decade.

A solid 8.2 out of 10.0 / A in my score."
238,The Godfather,10.0,"The best movie ever...
A masterpiece by the young and talented Francis Ford Coppola, about a Mob family and their drama, the story telling is perfect, the acting good, sometimes a little over the top in the case of Thalia Shire (the sister of the director)

The 70's were the best years for Hollywood."
239,Some Like It Hot,8.0,"Ridiculous plot, but very enjoyable nonetheless.

<em>'Some Like It Hot'</em> is good, unserious fun. Tony Curtis (Joe) and Jack Lemmon (Jerry) are the stars of the show, with amusing performances from start-to-finish. Marilyn Monroe is pleasant too, this is actually the first film of Monroe's I've seen. A good'un!

The pacing isn't perfect but that doesn't hamper things at all really. It's a bonkers 122 minutes, filled with entertaining shenanigans - the ending is particularly wacky. Don't think I would've liked it as well without Curtis & Lemmon, admittedly.

Worth watching, without question."
243,High Fidelity,8.0,"Seen this one a few times over the years, still great each viewing with John Cusack in his element, might even argue should've been nominated for an Oscar. I'm not a music fan but still liked that element and features a good supporting cast. **3.75/5**"
245,About a Boy,7.0,Really like this movie. Hugh Grant before he started playing himself.
251,Ghost,10.0,"Tony Goldwyn should have been a more popular actor. He was actually pretty exceptional in almost everything he has done but never actually made it to superstar status.

Instead he kind of lingered in supporting actor limbo through the 90s and then kind of disappeared.

It's a shame.

And he's not the only unsung hero in Ghost, Vincent Schiavelli is in it too.

It has a great cast that brings their all to the film.

The script isn't that imaginative, you've seen a few movies like this before, but that never really matters when it's done well."
252,Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,8.0,"Hadn't seen this one in many years, maybe last time was back in high school 20+ years ago. Delightful musical-comedy featuring the great Gene Wilder and deadpan, sarcastic humor that I immensely loved. Also the production design was excellent and musical numbers, including the catchy Oompa songs were wonderful. **4.25/5**"
253,Live and Let Die,8.0,Live and Let Die is a brilliant use of a new Bond (Roger Moore) and an iconic title song for one of the best Bonds there is.
262,The King of Comedy,8.0,"A bit long-winded, but undoubtedly a very good movie.

<em>'The King of Comedy'</em> has a sturdy Robert De Niro lead performance, as well as solid support from Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard. I enjoyed seeing the split from what actually happens and how De Niro's Rupert Pupkin views things via his dreams; especially with how merged they become by the end.

Absolutely zero surprise to now learn that Todd Phillips and Scott Silver used this and <em>'Taxi Driver'</em> as inspiration when writing <em>'Joker'</em>. Quite cool though!"
268,Batman,10.0,"There will never be a greater batman or movie ever. The original is still the only good batman movie out there. They keep trying but they had it right the 1st time, and they messed it up now."
268,Batman,8.0,"Probably one of the first serious attempts at bringing a comic to the big screen with a decent budget. The vision of the world is brilliant. Keaton's Batman is spot on and the Prince soundtrack ties the whole thing together perfectly. Unfortunately, Tim Burton's flamboyance lets things down in the end. But still the most memorable Batman to date. Although Ben Affleck's jaded, grumpy and bulked-out depiction of the character in Batman V Superman is my favourite."
272,Batman Begins,4.0,"i'm beginning to think people only say a movie is good because of it being long and having a good camera. to me the only highlight was cillian murphy's performance. the rest of this was just some dumb, boring trek."
272,Batman Begins,9.0,"‘Batman Begins’ is a strong introduction to the Batman thanks to the magnificent cast and a superb score by Zimmer and Newton Howard.

9/10"
272,Batman Begins,6.0,It was a nice change to see for a batman series of movies that were going down hill. This movie was ok but at least it's not as bad as the ones that were being made before this.
272,Batman Begins,7.0,"A very self-involved and glum Batman. Not my favourite. Once we finally get to Batman being Batman it's a cool movie. Christian Bale wears the cape well, but the villains lack grit."
277,Underworld,8.0,"Movies like _Underworld_ just don't end up with the calibre of actor that _Underworld_ has under normal circumstances. Somehow, _Underworld_ did though, and yes, it's very much a product of that early '00s industrial inspired age, but it is a solid, solid take on some realistic(ish) aspects of supernatural monster mythos.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
278,The Shawshank Redemption,6.0,Make way for the best film ever made people. **Make way.**
278,The Shawshank Redemption,10.0,"There is a reason why this movie is at the top of any popular list your will find.
Very strong performances from lead actors and a story line from the literary brilliance of Stephen King (and no, its not a horror).
Sufficient drama and depth to keep you interested and occupied without stupefying your brain. It is the movie that has something for everyone."
278,The Shawshank Redemption,10.0,"First time seeing this in probably close to 20 years, maybe longer. Forgot how excellent of a movie this was, amazing all around from the performances, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins especially, with a roller coaster of emotions. The writing (from Stephen King's novel) direction from Frank Darabont was precise and just all around fantastic. This is the very rare 5 star movies I've given but it is easily one of the best movies, right up there in my book with The Godfather. **5.0/5**"
278,The Shawshank Redemption,9.0,"**Watched it 32 times**

Call me obsessed, but I have watched this movie 32 times (and counting) over the past 2 decades. One may wonder why? It is because every time I watch this movie, I learn something new from it. For example, despite being such a good friend of Red, Andy never shares his plan with him. This taught me that discipline and focus is vital for success.

I can not praise enough the tight plot, direction, acting and everything. On my favorite movies list, this one certainly tops the chart."
278,The Shawshank Redemption,10.0,"Simple, I would say, beauty in the art of cinematography and storytelling."
280,Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10.0,"Behold what we like to call the Greatest Action Movie Ever Made, and for good reason. For me this sits without a doubt as one of the best movies (and movie sequels) I've ever seen. The action scenes, action set pieces, practical (and visual) effects are truly incredible for their time and still hold up today. Solid 10/10, highly recommend the full 2h 33m extended cut."
280,Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10.0,"""_I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle._""

Just when you think the first one was great, this masterpiece shows up. Everything gets amped up in a good way. I will never forget watching this for the first time and thinking ""how does it all look so damn cool?!"" The first one is terrfiying where this is just awesome. Cameron's lighting and color grading is so sweet to look at. It's an infinite rewatchable classic."
284,The Apartment,8.0,"A tiypical Billy Wilder comedy. Fun and with great script and performance from Jack Lemmon.

A must to see."
285,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,8.0,"Part 3 Jack is stuck in Davy Jones locker. While he is stuck, the biggest war is being set to happen. Jack and the others try to free him from Davy Jones locker before the war comes. Very good movie as well. Kind of boring at times though."
294,Desert Hearts,9.0,"Lately I felt I couldn't consider myself a self-respecting cinephile unless I at the very least sampled more works both by female directors and from the gay/lesbian/related subgenre. Fortunately my university offered in its library collection an assortment I decided to peruse occasionally. Although Deitch's film is a romantic drama featuring lesbians, I still readily enjoyed it. Glad I took a chance on it and decided to expand my horizons as a adventurous film aficionado."
296,Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,3.0,"The worst _Terminator_ movie. Which seeing as what came after it is... Quite the burn.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
306,Beverly Hills Cop III,5.0,"Very weak entry into the series with a more serious Murphy not exactly working as Foley. Still, can't say I hated it and was a passable time-waster. **2.5/5**"
310,Bruce Almighty,10.0,Another one of my favorite movies of all time. Jim Carey is one of my favorite actors. This movie is so funny. Who doesn't want to play God. I know would love to give it a shot if it was possible.
311,Once Upon a Time in America,8.0,"Stereotypical Sergio Leone film with endless waitings and sight crossings.

One of the performances that made Robert de Niro de actor he is and an interesting way of telling a story and the evolution of America during the years of the alcohol prohibition."
319,True Romance,8.5,"Can't believe I haven't seen this movie until now. My neighbor could not believe I never saw this movie, and suggested I watch it A.S.A.P.! I did and loved it! This is a _**must see**_ Star-Studded movie. One of Quentin Tarantino best works."
319,True Romance,6.0,"For the amount of Grade A and High B actors in the movie, along with the top o' the line writing cast, producers and director, you would think this would be nothing less than a 5-Star film. Unfortunately, the movie just never gathers any traction and seems to be nothing more than a collection of cameos without any cohesiveness, even with the story running in the background. Not a terrible flick, just a disappointing one."
320,Insomnia,8.0,"A relatively normal Christopher Nolan movie? Well I never!

<em>'Insomnia'</em> might not be as deeply entwined as what the director usually produces, yet in entertainment terms it is still right up there. I really enjoyed this one, thanks in large part to the performances of Al Pacino and Robin Williams - great to see those two icons onscreen together! You also have some nice visuals, Alaska looks real neat!"
320,Insomnia,8.0,Haven't watched this one in a while but been on an Al Pacino kick lately. Still holds up and features some great performances from Pacino and Williams. I would've loved to have been a fly on the wall behind the scenes with those two along with Christopher Nolan in his first bigger budget feature ($46 million). Not one of the best crime-thrillers but still well worth a watch. **4.0/5**
326,Snakes on a Plane,3.0,"Better than _Snakes on a Train_.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._"
329,Jurassic Park,8.0,"I love it. There are movies coming out right now, 25 years later, with triple the budget (even _Jurassic_ movies) where the effects just cannot hold a candle to _Jurassic Park_. If that was the **only** thing it had going for, it would be enough for me to recommend this movie for all, but make no mistake, _Jurassic Park_ is **great** with or without them (but thank God it's with).

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
329,Jurassic Park,10.0,"MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/

Many films age quite well, but Jurassic Park (1993) undoubtedly holds up better than most. From its memorable score to the still impressive animatronics, without forgetting its iconic characters, Steven Spielberg truly is a magnificent filmmaker. Remains as suspenseful as ever.

Rating: A+"
329,Jurassic Park,10.0,"**Overall : Unparalleled storytelling blends nostalgia and terror, producing one of the most extraordinary adventures ever on screen.**

Jurassic Park's groundbreaking special effects blended practical effects with cutting-edge computer-generated imagery, resulting in such realistic creatures that even many modern-day effects. Spielberg brought dinosaurs to life, capturing the imagination of every young child while still delivering thrills and scares. It's a beautiful combination of fantasy, adventure, and sci-fi terror. Jurassic Park set a new standard for storytelling and effects that inspired filmmakers to dream bigger and audiences to expect the magnificent."
329,Jurassic Park,8.0,The classic jurassic park movie. It's a theme park where the dinosaurs eventually break out of. Once they taste human flesh they can't get enough of it.
330,The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.0,"MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/

The Lost World definitely didn't deserve its originally bad reception. Sure, it's far from the incredible 1993's Jurassic Park. Less interesting character arcs and overall (silly) story.

However, it remains fun enough with equally memorable dinosaur sequences. Goldblum rocks.

Rating: B-"
330,The Lost World: Jurassic Park,5.0,Now they are trying to recover from the devastation that happened from the 1st one. This movie is pretty boring and not much happens.
331,Jurassic Park III,5.0,"Just as pointless to make as the last film. At least the raptor effects were back up to specs.

**_Alan!_**

_Final rating: ★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole_."
331,Jurassic Park III,6.0,"No longer a theme park. People still go to the island. A small group gets stranded on the island, and encounters the dinosaurs."
334,Magnolia,10.0,"Julianne Moore at her's Peak & and also all of em.
**What the Frogs!**"
335,Once Upon a Time in the West,9.0,"I can't say that this script doesn't play on Clint Eastwood's ""Man with No Name"" (which Sergio Leone also directed), but it's not important. If you're a spaghetti western fan, this film is a step up. The idea of putting Fonda in a bad guy role, and casting Bronson as anti-hero was a little shocking at first. At the end, I see how it worked to film's advantage by making all the characters more complex, ambiguous and real. If you were a Clint Eastwood, you'll love this film."
335,Once Upon a Time in the West,9.0,"Great western that I never watched despite owning the old DVD, but with Paramount releasing this on 4K UHD, decided to sit down through the 165-minute duration and it was a wonderful experience. Great performances all around, but most notably Jason Robards and Charles Bronson. Just another homerun from Sergio Leone though I think I prefer ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" but it's close. **4.5/5**"
346,Seven Samurai,10.0,"At the top of my favorite films ever. Every time I watch it is see something new. Bandits steal peasants rice. Peasants hire ronin samurai to defend them. Great plot, pace and acting. Akira Kurasawa's best...perhaps."
348,Alien,10.0,"The standard bearer of horror in space, Ridley Scott's masterpiece still thrills new generations of fans. The Giger-inspired alien induces a claustrophobic nightmare that still carries on in sequels and prequels."
348,Alien,10.0,This is a classic for a reason. It's one of those movies where technical flaws are completely overshadowed by the story and the atmosphere.
350,The Devil Wears Prada,7.0,"The cast elevate this film up a lot.

Everything else to do with <em>'The Devil Wears Prada'</em> is all perfectly fine don't get me wrong, but I most certainly wouldn't have enjoyed it as much without the cast. Meryl Streep does an excellent job portraying Miranda, while Anne Hathaway matches her as Andrea. Emily Blunt (Emily) is also enjoyable, as is Stanley Tucci (Nigel).

I never, personally, held too much interest in the plot, it does get a little bit repetitive in parts. With that said, thanks to Streep & Co., it's still a film that's definitely worth watching."
364,Batman Returns,8.0,The only other great batman movie. Not as much action but still was a really good movie.
364,Batman Returns,6.0,"Tim Burton's original Batman definitely deserved a worthy sequel. Unfortunately, this just doesn't cut it. Keaton's Batman deserved more grit and drama, not corny comical antics. It's worth a look, but keep your expectations low."
377,A Nightmare on Elm Street,10.0,"5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

My personal favorite slasher horror film that goes well with my Halloween costume, which itself is an accessory to this horror treasure of the 1980s decade!!!"
377,A Nightmare on Elm Street,8.0,The nightmare that started it all. Made us all scared to go to to sleep. My favorite horror series next to Friday the 13th. Love this movie.
381,To Catch a Thief,8.0,"Fluffy mystery-romance-thriller excels thanks to the wonderful charms of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. For me, this is a lesser Hitchcock film but still had plenty of fun and entertainment value even though there's nothing really noteworthy in terms of the story or any particular scene. **3.75/5**"
389,12 Angry Men,9.0,"A timeless classic in which the characters really come to life. Slowly exposing each man's thoughts, personalities and prejudices, ‘12 Angry Men’ isn't really about solving the crime, but about the power of reasoning, discussion and dialogue.

9/10"
391,A Fistful of Dollars,8.0,"Funny child acting, nonsense sense of distance, bad dubbing and weak dialogue bring down an otherwise magnificent film. A Western remake of Yojimbo, it's remarkable how such a simple story can lend itself to such a great experience. The atmosphere is built up masterfully - with stunning cinematography, striking close-ups, beautifully constructed mise-en-scene, a fantastic performance from Eastwood, Moricone's ever powerful music, and a lovely overabundance of laughing - all culminating in one of the best showdowns in cinematic history."
395,AVP: Alien vs. Predator,2.0,"Did they actually make this!? Wait, did I actually buy this!?"
397,French Kiss,10.0,"Yes, I'm a testosterone-driven macho male, but I have to admit this is one of my favourite movies. Over the years I've owned this one on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray and have literally watched it hundreds of times. It's a nice romantic-ish feel-good movie. Every character is a joy to watch and the script is endlessly quotable as my wife and I regularly punctuate conversations with wee snippets from this movie. So many people knock Kevin Kline's French accent in this, but they are wrong! The man is fluent in French for God's sake."
401,Garden State,6.0,Interesting and sometimes funny but with an aim of being more transcendental than what it actually is.
401,Garden State,7.0,Finally a Natalie Portman and Zach Braff performance I can get behind!
414,Batman Forever,6.0,"I absolutely hate Val Kilmer as Batman. Out of everybody that's played batman, he's the worse I've ever seen. Otherwise the movie wasn't that bad considering."
415,Batman & Robin,4.0,"This is the worse batman movie out of all of them. Besides Clooney, the acting was horrendous. No wonder why Clooney regrets being in this movie it sucked."
425,Ice Age,8.0,I actually enjoy this animation series. Every one is really funny and has a good story.
426,Vertigo,4.0,"I will never understand the universal adoration for Vertigo. Blindly inherited wisdom is the only explanation. How anyone could prefer this to North by Northwest or Rear Window is beyond me. An exceptionally made, exceptionally boring movie"
426,Vertigo,8.0,"Not one of my favorites from Hitchcock, and certainly dower, but still visually striking and two amazing performances from James Stewart and Kim Novak. This is only the second time seeing this, guessing the last time was maybe 10 years ago or so, not entirely sure when I'll revisit it. **3.75/5**"
426,Vertigo,9.0,"Perhaps it’s due to my dislike for the overrated “North By Northwest”, but as of now this is my favourite Hitchcock."
429,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",8.0,"Solid western, which generally isn't a favorite genre of mine, with great performances and some well shot scenes and landscapes. Been a long time since I saw A Fistful of Dollars or For a Few Dollars More, but this is a great entry in the ""Man With No Name"" Trilogy. **4.0/5**"
433,Mary Poppins,9.0,Of course everyone knows Mary Poppins. Loved it growing up. My family loves it now. I also still love this movie. I always will. Classic!
439,La Dolce Vita,5.0,"I get it.

But, much like my feelings towards 8½ and its 130 minute exploration of the artistic anxieties clawing at an enormously successful, world-renowned filmmaker: _I just don't care._"
440,Aliens vs Predator: Requiem,3.0,"Out of all the _Alien_ and _Predator_ franchise, a series stretching out for nearly 40 years, a cultural phenomenon that has wormed its way into all manner of media, and has produced no less than eleven official movie entries, _Aliens vs Predator: Requiem_ is the worst. It's so blatantly obviously the worst that I don't think any _Alien_ or _Predator_ or even _Alien vs Predator_ movie that we ever see from now until the end of time will ever unseat it as the worst.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
462,Erin Brockovich,6.0,Not that bad of a movie. Honestly there's all kind of plants around the world that pollute a lot of different things that are harmful to us. I wish they would have had trial in this movie and make them sweat. Would have been nice to see.
464,As It Is in Heaven,8.0,Predictable events on a still very nice story embedding the viewer into the (rural) Swedish society. The cast works really well and the director makes a fantastic job.
468,My Own Private Idaho,8.0,"Shakespeare meets street hustlers in a plot loosely inspired by Shakespeare's Henry IV part 1, Henry IV part 2 & Henry V. The film is both humorous and profound with River Phoenix's (Mike) shining & Keanu Reeves (Scott) also starring alongside some very memorable characters (Hans, Bob). 

I think it's probably of the best LGBT Films/ depictions of LGBT characters in film, & deservedly considered a cult classic. The offbeat film's authentic style coupled with its compelling, drifting story, make My own Private Idaho a must watch nearly 30 years after release."
470,21 Grams,9.0,"21 grams the movie was such a beautifully constructed story.
It had the rawest of emotions that are intense.
Some may find the content a bit heavy but I thought it was pure craft.
The way the story unfolds into each other is fabulous.

It’s a film about the basics of human nature.

21 grams is the weight of your soul apparently once it leaves your body when you die."
482,Shaft,7.0,"Richard Roundtree was great and Shaft as a character was absolutely amazing, everything else from the plot which was thin and performances by the supporting cast was a bit iffy. The pacing was also pretty slow and despite only being 100 minutes, felt a bit longer. Still, a good opening into the franchise. **3.5/5**"
490,The Seventh Seal,8.0,Interesting and iconic movie about faith and the meaning of life. A must seen.
497,The Green Mile,6.0,"Great acting by everyone involved, but the story is just not my cup of tea. If you like fake miracles (no shortage of people that do) and fantasy storylines, like prison guards that are humane and empathic (on death row nonetheless), then you might enjoy this more. I, however, will stick to more realistic fantasy, like mages fighting orcs and that sort of thing, and leave this in the trash pile of conservative media."
500,Reservoir Dogs,10.0,"This unique take on the heist-film-gone-wrong was excellent--stylish and intelligently made, yet very funny and inexpensive. Tarantino's accolades from giving American cinema the resuscitation it needed mirrors what has happened, at least since the 70's, with Martin Scorsese's 'Mean Streets', both in terms of entertaining violence and usage of music in the scoring of films. I greatly thank Harvey Keitel for taking a chance on Tarantino back then--It paid off in spades."
500,Reservoir Dogs,4.0,"I don't get it. Feels like nothing happens the whole film. Cool to see Buscemi in this though, I didn't realize he was in such an early one of Tarantino's films."
501,Grizzly Man,10.0,"Chilling first-hand documentation of a very brave young man, renouncing society and trying to find meaning among ferocious creatures in the wild.
Tragic yet heart-warming"
504,Monster,5.0,"The movie was alright. It was more of a sadistic type of love story. What they failed to capture is really how nuts she was. Like do less of a love story and more of her psychoness. The bitch was crazy! All the crazy interviews with her and all the outbursts she did in court, where's that? This movie almost tried to make you feel sorry for her when they really didn't show just how crazy she really was."
508,Love Actually,8.0,"Seen this one several times over the years and still so good, though the whole Colin Firth storyline didn't quite connect but cute nevertheless. Just a great ensemble — Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy and Hugh Grant were standouts — with plenty of heart and charm with risqué humor that doesn't get gross. Great movie for both Christmas and Valentine's Day. **4.0/5**"
521,Dial M for Murder,10.0,"I used to consider this second-tier Hitchcock, but a re-watch proved to me just how excellent the script and directing were, as well as how stellar and underrated both Grace Kelly and Ray Milland tend to be, at least presently, three generations after the fact. The suspense is tied tighter than the proverbial drum.

Needless to say, to this day, I never keep scissors on top of my desk anymore..."
521,Dial M for Murder,8.0,"While this is not one of the most popular Alfred Hitchcock films out there, it is still brilliant.

You can immediately recognise this film has Sir Alfred Hitchcock’s signature on it from the way the film is shot and its story is told.

I did not know anything about the film before I started watching it and I am glad I did it. There were plenty of surprises to see me going to the end of the film.

Would I watch it again? Possibly. Would I make my friends watch it? Definitely."
531,The Wrong Trousers,10.0,Fantastic short . It introduced the greatest villain ever with Feather McGraw who rival Darth Vader . The animation is a improvement upon the last short and the finale of this short with the model train chase is the stuff of legend
535,Flashdance,8.0,Entertaining drama with an amazing soundtrack and great performance from Jennifer Beals. Not the strongest story at times but still was enthralled through its reasonable 90-minute running time. **3.75/5**
539,Psycho,7.0,"Required viewing.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
539,Psycho,10.0,"My most favourite film from the master of suspense.

This psychological horror is widely considered to be the first ever slasher film. Powered by great performances from Anthony Perkins & Janet Leigh, and the outstanding score by Bernard Herrmann which adds such great tension throughout the film, it is unarguably the greatest thriller ever made. Only Alfred Hitchcock could make a film so entertaining and so horrifying at the same time.

The climax continues to haunt me forever."
539,Psycho,9.0,"Amazingly, this is my first ever viewing, not sure why I waited so long, but finally got around to it. Great movie in every way from the performance by Anthony Perkins to the atmosphere, enjoyed every bit of this even though I basically knew the entire plot at this point since all iconic scenes and lines have been repeated over the years. Not sure this is my *favorite* Hitchcock movie as I still prefer Rear Window, but obvious why it has held up 60 years later. **4.5/5**"
540,D.E.B.S.,6.0,"If multiverse theory is correct, somewhere there is a reality in which _D.E.B.S._ isn't gay, and that must truly be the darkest timeline.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
550,Fight Club,9.0,In my top 5 of all time favourite movies. Great story line and a movie you can watch over and over again.
550,Fight Club,9.0,"I was mostly neutral on this movie until the last third, when things turned psychologically thrilling and gave me American Psycho vibes. The ""His name was Robert Paulson"" scene specifically was where the film turned from 3 starts to 4.5 stars. Would recommend and I intend to return to this in some time as I feel it has higher rewatchability than many films of this style."
550,Fight Club,8.0,"Madness unbounded.  Don't try to make sense of insanity, just ride a wild ride."
551,The Poseidon Adventure,9.0,"Seen this one several times over the years and still is fantastic, from the performances (Hackman and Borgnine especially) to some genuinely emotional scenes to the incredible set designs. Not sure if I place this over The Towering Inferno, but think it might be 1A and 1B amongst disaster films. **4.5/5**"
557,Spider-Man,9.0,Sam Raimi's Spider-Man captures the spirit of the comic book hero and it's still one of my all time favourite superhero movies. It lays out the perfect blueprint for a superhero origin story that I love revisiting every year or so. I've always been able to relate to Peter Parker growing up. Tobey Maguire and Co. delivered a great interpretation of the characters in a way that still can not be matched.
561,Constantine,6.0,"With the announcement that a Constantine sequel was in development, decided to give this another watch (probably last time was when it was released on DVD). While I'm really not that big into the supernatural horror genre and have only basic knowledge of the Hellblazer comic, I still found this one mildly entertaining and for 2004/05, the effects weren't too bad, with the hell sequences looking pretty dang interesting, hopefully gets more exploration in the sequel. And Reeves was decent in the lead. **3.0/5**"
561,Constantine,8.0,"There are hell things on earth and only Keanu Reeves to give them a good kicking! This is a hugely imaginative vision of a movie, not a direct copy of the comic it was spawned from but still a fantastic creation. This movie is one of a kind and well worth your time."
561,Constantine,6.0,Decent movie. Has some pretty crazy possessions going on. The movie does tend to drag on a lot though. Hard to keep interested till the end.
562,Die Hard,8.0,"What can I even say about _Die Hard_? This is one of the most highly praised action movies of all time, and it has **actually earned that praise**.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
563,Starship Troopers,8.0,"A rare example of when a bad adaptation of a book winds up making a good standalone movie. Near Kubrick-ian in its wartime satire, _Starship Troopers_ is, before it is anything else, fun.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
564,The Mummy,7.0,"Trying to cram action, adventure, fantasy, romance, comedy and horror into a single should not have worked, especially not in a Universal Monsters reboot, but 1999's _The Mummy_ is so much damn fun, that they manage to pull it off with aplomb.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._"
567,Rear Window,9.0,"Probably have seen this a half dozen times over the years and still is my favorite Hitchcock movie, favorite mind you not best. Simple story and taking place in one location, but good performances from James Stewart and Grace Kelly. **4.5/5**"
567,Rear Window,7.0,I love a good plot twist as much as next person but maybe it was better back then.
571,The Birds,6.0,"Certainly has some creepy imagery and the acting was mostly passable, and I guess it works as a B-movie horror-thriller, but I never really found the birds all that terrifying. Probably the lower end of the Hitchcock movies I've seen. **3.25/5**"
577,To Die For,7.0,"Great performance from Nicole Kidman but this dark comedy didn't always do it for me, though it also could be I'm not the biggest fan of these mockumentary-like style films where actors (in character) talk to the camera. Still well worth watching for a fine cast. **3.75/5**"
578,Jaws,8.0,"Solid shark-thriller that still holds up well with each subsequent viewings. Love the cast especially Robert Shaw and was entertained even during some of the slower moments. Not a favorite of mine or amongst Spielberg's resume, but a lot of fun. **4.25/5**"
578,Jaws,8.0,"I saw this recently on the big screen for the first time since I originally went as a child in 1975 and if anything, it has got better. John Williams' score and Robert Shaw's ""Quint"" combine to far outweigh the ""rubber"" shark scenes. Unlike ""The Meg"" this film conveys a real sense of tension; coupled with some good old-fashioned scariness. It also dips it's toe into the science and behaviour of an apex predator, which we may consider ourselves to be. Take away our technical accoutrement and we are clearly the minnows..."
578,Jaws,10.0,"This is one of my favourite films ever and I've loved it since I was a child, everything from John Williams iconic shark theme to the chilling opening scene. Jaws is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece."
579,Jaws 2,7.0,"Adequate but still entertaining sequel has some okay practical effects with the shark though still really silly given what happened in the last one nobody in charge would listen to Brody. Nothing overly special and doubt I'd revisit this anytime soon, but an okay sequel. **3.25/5**"
582,The Lives of Others,10.0,"Good guys facing tragic circumstances in an interesting period of history. 

Because you view the main characters lives from the perspective of the morally confused Stasi Officer investigating them, you receive more information than the characters have about their hopeless situation. This makes it all the more tragic to see the suffering they endure. 

Absolutely love this film. The only film so far to make my dad and I cry."
583,Life of Brian,4.0,"This isn't Monty Python's best.
In fact, it's very ordinary humor for the most part.
The story of another man living a life parallel to Jesus could have been much funnier than this. 
However, people who love ""dry humor"" may appreciate this one more. It isn't the slapstick humor that we usually get from Monty Python that leaves a person nearly dying of laughter.
It's very low key humor. The only memorable scene is the suicide squad that comes to save Brian, which lasts a few seconds.
It's not totally boring, but it comes close. 4/10"
584,2 Fast 2 Furious,5.0,"Sadly, this sequel really did miss Vin Diesel. Paul Walker tries, he has a glint in his eye, and Tyrese Gibson gives it all he has as the wise-assed sidekick ""Roman"" but sadly this entire thing resembles an hybrid of ""Starsky & Hutch"" meets ""Miami Vice"". Plenty of squealing rubber, the cars and the people all look great but the thinnest of plots and some seriously woeful dialogue make this better to watch with the sound turned down. Poor stuff."
587,Big Fish,9.0,"First time seeing this since probably 2003 in theaters and it's absolutely heartfelt and charming, probably one of Tim Burton's best films, or at least one of my personal favorites of his. Great performances all around but especially Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney. Really well done. **4.5/5**"
588,Silent Hill,8.0,"Great story, atmospheric, and scary. The ending seems rushed though; once up to the church."
592,The Conversation,8.0,"“The Conversation” is not what you’d expect - but, it must be said, is fantastic and nearly flawless in its own right.

It is more similar to Antonioni’s “Blow” than DePalma’s, and a sense of eeriness flows throughout the work,
bolstered by Gene Hackman’s solemn and brooding performance.

The best thing about this movie though, is the shocking third act, which I wouldn’t dare spoil here. 

Overall, though the second act may be slightly underbaked, “The Conversation”  is a fantastic film and one of Francis Ford Coppola’s best."
595,To Kill a Mockingbird,7.0,"If you like children's story, you would love this movie about how the world is shaped from their eyes.

If you don't ... you may find some entertainment in the picture of Southern US and the racial fight that was taking place at the time ..."
596,The Grapes of Wrath,10.0,"Master piece from John Ford picturing the situation in US during the Great Depression and how an Oklahoma family tries to survive looking for jobs to California.

Everything is perfect: director, performances, script, etc.

A must to be watched."
597,Titanic,7.0,"Titanic was enjoyable initially, but the constant TV reruns got old fast. I don't even own a TV anymore, and I'm in no hurry to watch it again. Still, it's a good movie, deserving of a 7/10 rating."
597,Titanic,8.0,"This film is the perfect example of silly idea, immaculate execution. When you think about it, the film is really just a story about a woman who can't get over an intimate and sad experience with a homeless guy on a boat, but the way it's executed with the incredible performances by DiCaprio and Winslett really made it a legendary film. Reminds me of **_The Princess Bride_**, this film may be ""dumb"" but it's definitely a movie that will be and has been praised for many years."
599,Sunset Boulevard,8.0,"A classic for the must to be seen list.

Gloria Swanson is magnificent."
599,Sunset Boulevard,9.0,"Ace! <em>'Sunset Boulevard'</em> is a splendid flick from 1950.

I will note that I found the middle to be ever so slightly less interesting than the beginning and ending, though even so overall I most definitely enjoyed watching it. Love the dialogue, the score is excellent too. William Holden and Gloria Swanson are tremendous together onscreen, in what is a supremely well told story."
601,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,8.0,"Watched with my wife, the 7th grader, and the kindergartner. I only kind of half watched... It's been a long week. I really wanted to check out my youngest's reactions.

Watching this with my 5 y.o. involved answering a lot of questions, but she LOVED it: wide eyed amazement, tears at the appropriate places, and shouts of ""YEAH!!!"" during the bike scenes. 

Some of the animatronics are definitely dated, but it's weird seeing these older movies with kids so used to everything being CGI... Even my 7th grader said that some scenes seemed really realistic, which surprised me."
601,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,10.0,"**A RARE MAGICAL GEM**

E.T. The Extraterrestrial is a rare, unique once-in-a-lifetime experience you'll never forget. It will be one of those movies that will stick with you forever. Spielberg's direction, the cinematography, the visual effects, the acting, and last but not least John William's sweeping score when all combined conjure magic and strong feelings deep inside. You won't want to miss this masterpiece. So, watch this movie immediately if you haven't seen it or put this movie in your watchlist and see it ASAP!!!"
602,Independence Day,8.0,Very good movie. Funny as well with plenty of action. As they try to save the world from an alien invasion.
603,The Matrix,9.5,"The Martix is a great example of a movie that will live for ever or a very log time. The story and concept are out of this world. Keanu Reeves plays his role with utter brilliance, the cast was very well put together and the graphics are still to this day amazing. All in all one of the best movies of all time."
603,The Matrix,10.0,"It was around 2001 that I first watched this film and recently giving it another go, ever since, doesn't change the fact for me that this movie is an timeless piece of filmaking. From the characters to the striking and thought-provoking story, it basically has everything to make an action film a 10/10 in a book."
35040,Croc,6.0,"***Decent small budget croc flick made in Thailand***

A 20-foot croc terrorizes Krabi, Thailand, while an egotistical mogul tries to put a private zoo out of business by blaming the croc attacks on smaller crocs from the zoo. Peter Tuinstra plays the protagonist, who runs the croc farm while Sherry Edwards appears as his romantic interest, an agent from the animal welfare department. Michael Madsen shows up in the second half as a formidable croc hunter. 

""Croc"" (2007) is a TV movie that only cost $750,000, but it’s a surprisingly compelling crococator flick, all things considered. The highlight is the unique setting of west coast, Thailand, and life thereof. Sure, some of the acting by Asian unknowns is questionable, but if you roll with it, you’ll get over it. 

Tuinstra makes for a likable protagonist while Madsen does well in what is a cheap gig. The cast of women are interesting, but the filmmakers coulda done better as far as feminine appeal goes.     

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot in Krabi, Thailand.

GRADE: B-/C+"
35054,Whirlwind,1.0,"This is insipid. The actors are stiff, the script sucks, the camera struggles to stay in focus, and there aren't even any steamy sex scenes or nudity to make up for it. This movie's poster is the only pleasure you'll get out of it. Don't bother."
35056,Date Night,7.0,"Good fun; probably better than it should be in truth.

<em>'Date Night'</em> features a nonsensical plot but manages to make it suitably entertaining, helped by the fact that it also has a positively ridiculous cast list - so many familiar faces!

Steve Carell and Tina Fey lead well to hold the film together, while there are roles for Taraji P. Henson, William Fichtner, James Franco, Mila Kunis, Mark Wahlberg, Kristen Wiig and Ray Liotta - that's not even all, as Mark Ruffalo, Gal Gadot and Jon Bernthal - plus yet more others - feature too. Stacked!

At less than 90 minutes, this 2010 flick also doesn't overstay its welcome. A solid film, nothing more or less for me."
35056,Date Night,8.0,Very hilarious movie. I need some date nights like this one. Life is pretty boring. All date nights should be like this one.
35101,The Last Flight of Noah's Ark,6.0,"<em>'The Last Flight of Noah's Ark'</em> is average.

One of the reasons for that is the lacklustre plot, which is one we've practically already seen before from Disney in years prior - like 1960's <em>'Swiss Family Robinson'</em> and 1966's <em>'Lt. Robin Crusoe U.S.N.'</em>. This isn't incredibly similar to those two, but they are certainly in the same ballpark.

The premise doesn't have much about it in terms of action or heart, the ending threatens to finish with a highly meaningful moment but instead bottles it in favour of a more happier conclusion. Elsewhere, you have a forgettable cast. Elliott Gould (Dugan) and Geneviève Bujold (Bernadette) are alright, though they lack the necessary chemistry together.

Close to being a good'un, but just misses out in my books."
35115,"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier",6.0,"All six foot six inches of Fess Parker epitomises well one of the heroes of the fledging United States in this episodic retelling of his rise from frontiersman battling Indians and unscrupulous settlers through his time in Congress to his final ill-fated stance at the Alamo. I can't vouch, much, for any historical authenticity - it is just a Disney film that celebrates the legend of the man, and his long-time sidekick George Russel (Buddy Ebden) with a catchy theme song and lots of action scenes. It has twinges of a social conscience - using Crockett as a conduit for the principles of fairness, decency and loyalty that underpinned much of he traditions of the ""Founding Fathers"" of the USA back at the start. Parker is a little wooden in the lead, but works well with Ebden to create an enjoyable, at time amusing, action adventure well worth a watch. As ever with films like this, do bear in mind that some of the language and roles are very much of their intended time."
35139,Teenagers from Outer Space,3.0,"Rock Lobster and the Skeleton Crew.

An alien race come to earth with less than honourable motives in their genes...

Gargons Will Rule The Universe!

Ah, well, one needs to have a modicum of interest in the ""Z"" grade sci-fi schlocker craze of the 1950s to even watch this picture. To understand why it exists, with a knowledge of budget restrictions etc, allowances can be made. Yet it's so dreadfully performed and constructed it asks for giant leaps of faith even from the most hardened of cult schlock fans.

In truth there's only enough material here to have filled a half hour Twilight Zone episode, in fact thinking about the acting this would have made a good silent feature. There's some fun in the ray guns used, which reduce living beings to skeletons, and the flying saucer is funky, hell there's even the notion that aliens get horny as well. But come the time when the rock lobster puts in a show, you wont know whether to laugh or cry... 3/10"
35144,The Journey of Natty Gann,9.0,"Wholesome, charming and touching. Great film.

<em>'The Journey of Natty Gann'</em> is an excellent adventure drama. This absolutely flies through its 101 minute run time, that's mostly - though not entirely - thanks to how well paced the film is. It never stays in one spot for too long, which makes it entertaining. It doesn't sacrifice any character development by doing that either.

Meredith Salenger portrays the titular character. She is fantastic, from start-to-finish. A terrific debut! A young John Cusack makes an appearance, he is good in the role of Harry. You also have Ray Wise involved as Sol. All three of those add a lot to the production, credit to 'em. The wolfdog, Jed, is adorable too.

A real sweet, but also fun, film from Disney; it's into my live-action top five from them; of the ones I've watched at this point, up until 1985."
35185,The Smallest Show on Earth,7.0,"What if you were informed that you've just inherited your late uncle's ""fortune"" and then you found out that this ""fortune"" was, in reality, just an old, dilapidated, little movie theater?  I'm assuming you'd be none too happy.  Well, neither were Matt and Jean Spenser in this enjoyable little comedic romp.  But they learn to make the most of the cinema, as well as the delightful assortment of oddball characters that go with it.  Peter Sellers has an interesting turn here as the wacky, behind-the-scenes projectionist, and the whole thing is indeed very amusing.  There's an abundance of unique and entertaining performances in this British-made little oddity that's a sort of tongue-in-cheek tribute to silent films.

Would I recommend?  Yes.  A minor comedy that makes for pleasant viewing."
35188,The Disorderly Orderly,8.0,"This was great fun! I don't care what ANYONE says--I love Jerry Lewis' movies. Sure, some of his mayhem and gags don't work, but enough of them do to make all of his movies enjoyable--at least for this cinephile."
35201,The Holcroft Covenant,6.0,"Decent premise, but it's just a bit of a slow watch for me.

That's despite <em>'The Holcroft Covenant'</em> having moments that either should be or are enjoyable, but in between lies iffy pacing and uninteresting characters. I also found the cinematography lacking, for instance they visit a fair few different countries and yet I never got a feeling for the film's world itself - just scene, cut, scene, cut etc.

Michael Caine is entertaining though, as he always seems to be. I enjoyed his performance, some of his humour early on is good. As for those around Caine, I liked Victoria Tennant, Bernard Hepton and Michael Lonsdale. It is a fairly solid cast, to be honest.

With that said, I finished watching and just felt like it was missing something. 6*."
35253,Madame Tutli-Putli,7.0,"The eponymous lady, weighed down by a mountain of luggage and pestered by a moth is awaiting a train. She boards to find two of the passengers engaging in what I can only describe as the most surreal game of chess - the moves randomly decided by the train's movements over the tracks and the points! Her other fellow passengers are best viewed as an eclectic mix and as she looks around she envisages just what one of them might have done ordinarily, before he behaves quite provocatively towards her. The train stops, all is quiet in this increasingly fantastic world in which she lives. The character (I thought she looked a bit like Isabella Rossellini) dresses twinset and pearls, like something from the 1920. The technology could be from now or even futuristic and gradually her nervousness in traveling transfers to us watching. The standard of character clay animation is impressive and the attention to detail - especially the faces, is at times quite expressive and sinister. Where is she going and who or what is with her? What's with the green mist? What's with the moth? ""Horror Express"" look out...!"
35412,On the Beach,4.0,"Like watching paint dry.

Stanley Kramer and John Paxton adapt from Nevil Shute's novel. Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire, Anthony Perkins and Donna Anderson star, with music by Ernest Gold and cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno.

After a global nuclear war, the inhabitants of Australia realise that the radiation clouds are heading their way. A group of people try to come to terms with this fact.

A well regarded film by the critics, and lauded by the makers at the time as an important and potent piece of cinema, On the Beach is still a film that's not for everyone.

The star appeal holds weight, though much of the narrative is tired and weary, trite and cheesy. In fact Shute himself was less than happy with what Kramer made of his literary source, the director in his element with a message movie.

If it was Kramer's intent to make the viewers also feel like what it's like waiting for death? Then he achieved it, while Gold's overuse of Waltzing Matilda in his musical score also ends up boring the senses. 4/10"
35580,The Bridges at Toko-Ri,8.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this suspenseful film, well directed by Mark Robson and with a wonderful cast. The scene in which the plane is trying to bomb the bridges amongst enemy fire reminded me of the boat in Apocalypse Now. The acting, particularly by William Holden, Grace Kelly and Mickey Rooney, is marvelous. Definitely an underrated classic."
35611,Assignment: Outer Space,3.0,"This film is quite curious - much of the dialogue appears to be dubbed but only some from Italian, the rest from English. Makes me wonder which market this sci-fi yarn was ever intended for. It also looks pretty colourised, though claims to be in Technicolor - which it certainly isn't. That's about all, sadly, that is of interest in this rather dreary tale of a journalist aboard a spacecraft who has a distinct personality clash with the commander. To make matters worse, another craft with the potential to destroy all living things on Earth has entered the Solar System and our disgruntled rocketeers have to try and disable it. Lots of slow panning shots and smouldering close ups, ropey effects and a mechanical sounding soundtrack (almost bell tolling) fail to get this going. It's just dull."
35663,The Incredible Petrified World,8.0,"This film is one of your typical late 50's B-Movies. The premise is **somewhat** believable, but just not enough. The direction is somewhat decent, but I've seen other, better B-movies.

I found this in Wal-Mart on one of those Mill Creek compilation DVD's."
35664,The Alpha Incident,4.0,"Now yes, this is awful - no budget, poor acting and visual effects from an early 1960's episode of ""Dr. Who"" - but it is not the worst of these beastie from outer space films I've ever seen. The gist - well an organism arrives on Earth, attaches itself to a couple of unsuspecting people who must not sleep if they are to stay alive. Stuffed full of coffee and amphetamines, they must hole up in an office whilst the powers that be work on some sort of salvation. It's a race against time, and yes also against your eyelids starting to send your brain the ""time for bed"" message... Actually, Ralph Meeker is Ok in this, but the slightly claustrophobic environment in which much of it is set merely draws attention to the poor writing and pretty unremarkable supporting cast - except maybe the nice but dim 'Hank"" (George Flower) who truly is as dense as a rock - and the fact that virtually nothing happens at all until the very, very end... Sorry, this is just boring."
35669,The Satanic Rites of Dracula,5.0,"The great grandson of the original ""Van Helsing"" (Peter Cushing) is drafted in by Scotland Yard to investigate a series of deaths that smack of vampirism. The investigation centres around a manor house where the great and the good of London society meet, ostensibly for ordinary gatherings, but we know it is much more sinister (well, in theory, anyway). What's more - this house is built upon an old cemetery, and guess who was buried in it just a few years earlier? This is a sort of 1970s ""Freemasons meet Dracula"" affair, with a lacklustre dialogue and some pretty lame performances all round. It builds predictably to a conflagration that seems a long time coming, and neither Cushing nor the fleeting appearances from Christopher Lee really ignite the film. The score has that early synthesised sound to it, and the photography - though probably quite effective in 1973, now looks dated and juddery. These Hammer films were well past their sell-by dates by now, the gift had long since stopped giving and perhaps because it is in colour, it is not remotely scary. Passable, but only because I like the genre."
35739,Do or Die,4.0,"Pretty much more of the same from Andy Sidaris with T&A and bad acting combined with terrible writing. At least the plot this go around wasn't as over-complicating compared with the others, though still don't understand why these villains (this time played by Pat Morita) don't just target the entire ""Agency"" rather than the two agents. Oh well, at least Roberta Vasquez was easy on the eyes and possessed some on-screen presence compared with the others. **2.25/5**"
35791,Resident Evil: Afterlife,4.0,"As bad as the rest of the saga.

Tons of action and FX with brainless script and plenty of bad actors."
35791,Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.0,"Second time seeing this one, basically feel the same way, not terribly impressive effort, some spotty visual effects, a few silly fun moments however the finale looked like a poor Matrix copycat. But found some parts entertaining enough, just nothing all that memorable. **2.5/5**"
35791,Resident Evil: Afterlife,6.0,Still in the process of bringing the umbrella company down. Alice finds out about a safe haven from her rescuers.
35810,The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss,6.0,"This certainly had the potential to be a good film, but somehow it is all just a little too sterile. Cary Grant (""Bliss') is engaging enough as the millionaire who is feeling a bit under the weather. Advised to visit a slightly maverick doctor ""Sir James Alroyd"" (Peter Gawthorne), he is told the best remedy is for him to actually do some hard work for a year - get his body and brain away from his decadent lifestyle. So, off we go on a series of escapades during which he starts to discover just how difficult it is for him to survive, let alone thrive, in these newly hostile environments. Sadly, though - it's just got no oomph. What could have been funny and entertaining scenarios seem to lack something. Grant is fine, but Mary Brian (""Frances"") adds little, indeed she is quite annoying at times and the story is just somewhat undercooked. There are moments of humour, though and there is a modicum of chemistry between the two at the top of the bill, but it's all just a touch underwhelming."
35824,The Navigators,7.0,Movie in the good social tradition of Ken Loach which brings us to the dismantling of the public UK railway system through the decline  in the living standard of the workers for the enriching of the owners of the new private companies in the name of the nonsensical liberal capitalism.
35896,Beyond the Forest,10.0,"Who better than Ms. Davis to impersonate herself?  This is her last film for Warner Brothers so old Harry gave her the screws with this melodramatic pot-boiler which, as it turn out, is an absolute hoot. A plethora of zingers, one-liners and one of the most famous lines in American cinema (""What a dump""), Bette chews up the scenery in her long hair wig and heaving breasts like never before. She's just plain nasty and as Elizabeth Taylor would later describe her to Richard Burton in ""WAOVA"", she's ""discontent"" or she's a housewife...""She buys things"". Well, the only thing BD buys here is a one way ticket to the platform of the local Chicago bound train depot, before applying a slathering of make-up which surely was a try-out for Baby Jane. You must watch this if you love campy, over-the-top emoting by an iconic actress hell-bend on career self-destruction."
35906,The Falklands Play,7.0,"Recently, there have been a spate of singularly poor dramas about historical figures from the British Isles - ""Mary, Queen of Scots"" (2018), ""Robert, the Bruce"" (2019) being two of the least agreeable - but this takes that low benchmark and throws it under the bus (or chariot). Anyone expecting a battle-fest featuring this famously brave and courageous Queen leading loads of people in woad fighting off the fearsome Roman Legions is in for an huge disappointment. You will possibly have seen bloodier battles on a rugby field - indeed, what action there is seemed more about whether our as yet only teenage Boudica was going to be seduced by a deserting Roman legionnaire impersonating, well, who really cares. I'm afraid that this is just dreadful - the sort of film you would be proud of your kids making at college, but deserving of no more than that. The production quality is adequate, and actually the technical aspects - costumes, wattle huts etc., are adequate too - but the acting, dialogue and the whole pace of the thing makes you ever grateful that it's just 80 minutes long... Avoid, you know you want to."
35914,Cry of the Werewolf,5.0,"Nina Foch is quite efficient in this run-of-the-mill drama. She is a gypsy princess ""Celeste"", whom, we learn quite early on, has an interestingly carnivorous diet! Now I suppose what lets this down is that, from a creative perspective, the use of an actual beastie rather than a costume-clad person robs it of something. I could imagine someone like Rudd Weatherwax just out of shot calling the real shots. As it is therefore, it's all a rather formulaic story. The production is eerily photographed but that might have had as much to do with lack of budget as with artistic intent. It's only an hour and there are a few redeeming features to sustain it - some clever use of shadow and the ever reliable Barton McLane as pursuing copper ""Lane"", but for the most part it falls short on the creepy front and is pretty indistinguishable from so many others made during the War."
35915,Crime Unlimited,6.0,"Scotland Yard are being increasingly frustrated after a spate of jewel robberies leaves them baffled. Assistant Commissioner Cecil Parker comes up with a daring plan to plant one of their own in the gang perpetrating these crimes. Esmond Knight (""Borden"") is the man selected, and after faking a crime of his own, seeks to fence the jewels and so manages to ingratiate himself with the gang of the always unseen mastermind. The gang are naturally suspicious of their newest member, but luckily he falls in with Lilli Palmer (""Natasha"") who knows all the secrets and is desperate to quit the gang... Can he identify and capture this enigmatic criminal and ensure both of them survive? It was Palmer's first English-language appearance and though striking, she is little more than competent - the same can be said for Knight and the drama is stodgily paced with little of note happening until quite an enjoyable twenty minutes when it all comes to quite a sinister head. It's fine, this - cheap and cheerful, but just a bit too sluggish."
35945,Howling V: The Rebirth,6.0,"***Ten Little Indians and One Werewolf***

Shot in an actual Hungarian castle, the plot of ""Howling V: The Rebirth"" (1989) is borrowed from ""The Beast Must Die"" (1974) wherein a group of people spend the night in a huge European estate while one of the party, a werewolf, systematically butchers the guests. It's basically a whodunit a la Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None."" It's also reminiscent of the underrated ""Devil's Nightmare"" aka ""The Devil Walks at Midnight"" (1971), albeit not as good.

Still, it comes close, and although the werewolf is barely seen I found this a solid low-budget mystery flick with a werewolf. Besides, Elizabeth Shé (Marylou) has an exceptional scene and there's a superb Gothic score. But gorehounds who want to see loads of bloody werewolf action should pass (there's a little, but not enough to appease modern gorehounds).

The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes.

GRADE: B-"
35977,Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings,4.0,"Incredibly contrived and overly convenient, with a truly awful title to boot, _Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings_ is a massive step down from its predecessor. Works only as the sort of thing you have on in the background, only gracing with your attentions for the brief golden moments Pumpkinhead is doing his thing.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
35978,Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes,4.0,"Perhaps a better sequel than _Blood Wings_, but still not a good movie. Those who are invested enough in practical effects might enjoy the return of the titular creature itself, but if you're looking for success in plot, acting, direction, etc. then seek it elsewhere.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
35979,Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud,2.0,"The ""Well at least Pumpkinhead looked good!"" excuse has officially run out of steam as we hit the fourth entry into the vengeance demon's horror franchise, _Blood Feud_. After some bullshit about how the Hatfields and McCoys actually hate each other because one family didn't give a car to the other(???) the titular Pumpkinhead is summoned because of course he is, to act as secondary antagonist in redneck Romeo and Juliet and- you know what, I'm done? It's the worst of the bunch and that's saying something considering it's coming off of two back-to-back failures in the series before it.

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"
35980,Quest For The Lost Tribes,10.0,"Well it breaks from Simcha Jacobovici's tradition of taking insane leaps of faith... at least a little.

What it mostly does is follow people as they try to find the lost tribes, and some of it, far more than his other productions, use actual sleuthing and not slight of hand.

And it fails to draw a lot of the insane conclusions that are a trope of his other works.

It's just a shame that this tradition didn't continue to his more popular documentaries."
36006,Ruggles of Red Gap,7.0,"Charles Laughton is superb as a butler who is lost in a poker game by his English aristocrat employer and so has to relocate to ""Red Gap"" to work for a couple nouveau riche Americans at the start of the 1900s. Initially a fish out of water in his new home with his brash, socially aspiring, but unsophisticated new American employers he quickly turns this all to his advantage and what ensues is a delightful, subtle piece of comedy. I'm still searching for a bad Laughton film, this certainly isn't it - well worth 90 minutes of your time."
36049,Rich and Strange,5.0,"A good advertisement for a holiday cruise this definitely isn't: a combination of sea-sickness; decks packed to the gunwales and some overtly snobbish fellow passengers make me realise why I quite like planes! Henry Kendall and Joan Barry come into a windfall inheritance and decide to celebrate by going on such an holiday - and soon discover that it isn't all it is cracked up to be. Using some of Hitchcock's expertly hones silent film skills, we tell the story as our nouveau-riche couple slowly realise that wealth isn't everything as their behaviour and attitudes start to adapt to their new surroundings. Don't look for any traditional suspense or thrills in this; it is a much more pedestrian assessment of shallowness and flummery with some quite poignant observations of a rather pointless existence."
36102,The Swindle,7.0,"I had no idea, until recently, that Broderick Crawford had ever done this film and he's really quite good. He (""Augusto"") leads a trio of grifters who take the low hanging fruit. They have no scruples about robbing the vulnerable, ordinary folks - and are quite imaginative when it comes to their scams. Set against a backdrop of a still recovering post-war Italy, there is an effective cynicism about the way the plot and the characters develop. Crawford works well with sidekick Richard Basehart's ""Carlo"" but his is the stand out role. The rest of the film does run a little to typical crime-noir stereotype, but the photography that marries the bleak with the beautiful, and a superb score from the always reliable Nino Rota give this more of a grandeur. I wasn't mad on the ending - it was just too easy, too predictable and somehow underwhelmed Crawford's otherwise really quite nuanced performance. It tugs well at our heart-strings at times whilst offering a soupçon of humour and is a film that demonstrated a talent in the star I wasn't expecting."
36139,High Plains Invaders,4.0,"Much better effects than the average SyFy faire. James Marsters performs well considering, and the Western/Sci-Fi blend pays off. But it's still a TV Movie and it's a pretty silly one at that.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._"

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
36141,The Underneath,6.0,"One of Steven Soderbergh's early films, a bit too slow of a burn neo-noir, character study that features some fine performances by Peter Gallagher and Alison Elliott. Wasn't completely enamored with the movie but the last 30-minutes were okay and you could see Soderbergh's style coming into fruition that he would utilize a few years later with Traffic, which still remains my personal favorite from him. **3.0/5**"
36174,"Goodbye, Mr. Chips",6.0,"I had seen at least one version of this novel adapted for film, but I have always liked Martin Clunes so I wanted to watch this one. He does his usual stellar performance in the title role, and Victoria Hamilton, who stood out in Lark Rise to Candleford, is vivacious and perfect here as Kathie.

The movie is perfectly fine, though I can’t say I will be drawn to watch it again in the future. As with To Serve Them All my Days, the story follows a long-serving school teacher who share the experience of seeing their graduates dying in a world war, as well as both having their wives die young. This movie comes off sad to me, even with his small victories in school policy and student progress, a feeling which might have been mitigated if he had been allowed to be married more than a couple of years.

I suppose in most movies the hero triumphs over evil or danger; Mr. Chips settles for triumphing over boredom and sadness."
36191,Garden of Evil,6.0,"Susan Hayward always was a little better at playing the feistier characters, and with her ""Leah"" role here, she certainly has a good try. She manages to convince three disparate men to travel with her from Mexico to a cave deep inside Apache territory to rescue her gold-mining husband who is trapped there. ""Hooker"" (Gary Cooper), ""Fiske"" (Richard Widmark) and ""Fuller"" (Hugh Marlow) have the uneasiest of truces between them at the best of times, but off they all go on some set-piece escapades to deliver the man. Hayward does plenty of smouldering here, but the rest of the story is pretty devoid of much action. There isn't much chemistry going on as each try to outmanoeuvre the other, stay alive and hopefully reap the $2,000 reward money she has promised them (which she quite possibly hasn't even got!). It does look good, plenty of grand outdoor cinematography, some lovely sunsets etc., but the title of this western is probably the most intriguing thing about it. Pity, had the direction been a bit tighter and more inspired, this could have been much better. Watchable, though, just not memorable."

36236,The Witches,7.0,"Rather zany, <em>'The Witches'</em> entertains sufficiently.

Anthology films aren't usually my thing but I found the oddness of this production to be worth watching. It somehow works. There are five stories portrayed, all of which have their moments even if some are definitively better than others. The music is good, also.

""The Witch Burned Alive"", the opener, is the standout, ""Civic Spirit"" is amusingly short, ""The Earth Seen from the Moon"" is one of the weaker entries as it drags a little, ""The Sicilian Belle"" is a little forgettable and, the finale, ""An Evening Like the Others"" is the most strange but does satisfy due to its unusualness and comical nature.

That last one's weirdness is elevated by the appearance of Clint Eastwood - which is made even more peculiar as he doesn't even voice his character due to the Italian language barrier; Giuseppe Rinaldi provides the voice, fwiw. It is bizarre yet, again, does work.

The star of this 1967 release, though, is Silvana Mangano, who leads all five stories. She is excellent across them all, this is my first exposure to her and I'm intrigued to potentially see more of her work in the future."
36245,Diary of a Chambermaid,9.0,"Solid. One of my favourites, both in terms of Bunuel (my 4th favourite director ever) and of Moreau. Sheer, unadulterated genius. There was never anyone quite like him and there never will be again--and that's a dirty rotten shame. Paraphrasing David Thomson, he once said that every film frame from both Renoir or Bunuel was perfectly shot. And thankfully he was accurate."
36267,Mr. Bones,8.0,"One of the funniest movies to ever come out of Africa, would definitely recommend for anyone wanting a good laugh"
36330,Dangerous Crossing,7.0,"I though this had a little of ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938) to it as we follow the adventures of ""Ruth"" (Jeanne Crain) aboard a cruise liner. She embarked with her new husband ""John"" but he's gone missing. Not just missing, but there's not a trace of him to be found anywhere. The Captain (Willis Bouchey) and ship's doctor ""Manning"" (Michael Rennie) are not convinced that she's the full shilling - and as she becomes more and more frantic and desperate most conclude that the man never existed in the first place! Gradually, though, we realise that this is quite a clever cat and mouse game with a man playing the poor woman like a fiddle for her fortune. Luckily the doctor seems to see some sanity in her behaviour and maybe, just maybe, he can help her thwart the plan to drive her mad - or, even, overboard! Crain holds this together well. She manages her voyage between lucidity and madness effectively and though Rennie is maybe just a little too insipid, it's still quite an engaging and intriguing maritime thriller with an haunting fog-horn sounding throughout like a mourning bell!"
36334,Deadline - U.S.A.,7.0,"Humphrey Bogart (""Ed"") is superb in this tale of a newspaper editor whose paper is being sold by it's owners. With all looking for their next job, he must try to galvanise his team into an investigation of local mafia kingpin ""Rienzi"" after one of their number is killed. Occasionally cluttered by a rather clumsy romance (his relationship with soon to be remarried ex-wife ""Nora"" (Kim Hunter)), this film really focusses on just how newspapers were run in post war USA: gritty, determined and authentic journalism competing with organised crime, personal and family interests (some benign, some less so), corruption and physical danger - all to deliver the daily news to the breakfast tables of millions of New Yorkers. Ethel Barrymore adds some class as the newspaper's proprietress who begins to doubt the wisdom of the sale as she is also drawn into the almost visceral nature of this investigation into a man who uses threats and lawyers to remain one step ahead of the authorities. It packs quite a punch for almost all of it's 90 minutes, and really does show off the star and the writing at their best."
36335,Dear Murderer,7.0,"This is a cracking little murder mystery that actually gives Eric Portman a chance to play a more substantial role, and to do it well. He discovers that his wife ""Vivien"" (Greta Gynt) has been having an affair with ""Fenton"" (Dennis Price) whilst he has been working abroad, so he contrives a plan to be rid of him with a perfect murder. As he carries out his dastardly deed, he discovers that his wife has more than one man on the go, and so sets up the hapless ""Jimmy"" (Maxwell Reid) to take the fall and to make his cheating missus suffer in the process. Policeman Jack Warner (who else?) soon suspects multiple rats and the story becomes more complex as Portman and Gynt play a great game of cat and mouse with each other, and with the police - before a clever, quite satisfactory, denouement. Arthur Crabtree keeps this tight, with good dialogue and a strong ensemble effort that is well worth a watch."
36336,Deep Waters,7.0,"Dana Andrews is ""Hod"" - a professional architect who much prefers his life as a lobster fisherman. This causes a bit of hassle with his fiancée ""Ann"" (Jean Peters), who is worried about the dangers of this maritime career. She is a social worker, and when she brings the young orphan ""Donny"" (Dean Stockwell) to hopefully find a permanent home in their small Maine town, the boy and ""Hod"" - and his colleague ""Joe"" (Cesar Romero) become fast friends. Henry King has created a good framework for this well paced and engaging story that takes a sensitive look at a young boy looking for roots, whilst offering us a gently simmering, lively, romance with some characterful performances - including the usually reliable Anne Revere (""Mary""). The last ten minutes are quite an exciting watch - the back-shot storm sequence is quite well integrated into the action, and folks gets well and truly soaked!"
36339,Double Confession,6.0,"This is quite a decent, complex, little British crime drama with Derek Farr as ""Jim Medway"" who turns up at an English seaside resort whereupon, shortly afterwards, his wife is found murdered in the ""White Cottage"". The police investigation is soon focussed on him, so he tries to fit up local bigwig ""Charlie Durham"" (William Hartnell) with whom he has certain history, and finds he has bitten off a bit more than he was expecting to chew. It's a superior first effort from Ken Annakin that capitalises on the quirky novel from John Garden and some solid performances on screen - including an on-form Peter Lorre as Hartnell's slightly bonkers sidekick and local journo ""Hilary Boscombe"" (Ronald Howard) that keeps the pot boiling well for 80 minutes. Rarely seen nowadays, but worth a watch if you like your mysteries with a little more meat on the bone."
36344,Alaska,7.0,"**Actually pretty good, one of the better wildlife/animal family films of the 90's.**

Definitly ALOT better than for instance THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE which was released the year before, with some perfectly fine acting from even the kids one of which is Vincent Kartheiser who would later become one of the main stars in the tv series ANGEL.

The other is Thora Birch, she might not be as good as Vince but she was okay at least.

Would have worked as purely a survival film but they had to throw in some baddies in it as well, one of which is played by Charlton Heston the father of the director of the film Frasert C Heston.

I'm not saying that they weren't okay baddies or anything but sometimes less is more as they say. But still as a family adventure film in the veins of the stuff Disney did in the 90's it's most certainly above average."
36354,Steele Justice,5.0,"Cheesy 1980s action-thriller has its moments but lead actor Martin Kove had very little charisma and the fight choreography wasn't all that well done either. I suppose it was watchable and maybe with a group some fun may be had, but this is just another forgettable action film amongst a slew from the 1980s not starring Stallone or Schwarzenegger. **2.5/5**"
36419,After.Life,4.0,The movie was ok and had a decent storyline. Also is entertaining and makes you want to know what's going to happen but it has a dumb ending in my opinion.
36461,Manhandled,6.0,"Dorothy Lamour is good in this otherwise rather drab crime noir. The plot is overly complex, bordering on the convoluted - you could almost get dizzy trying to follow the plot. Which is (briefly): Lamour plays ""Merle""; the PA to a psychiatrist. She casually discusses his private cases with her on/off amour (Dan Duryea) and one such story involved a client's (Alan Napier) dreams that he kills his wealthy wife. Well, yep - you've guessed - the wife is duly murdered and an investigation ensues. Duryea, as the oily, smart-mouthed PI and Sterling Hayden as the investigating insurance man do fine, and Art Smith makes for quite a decent cop, but Lewis Foster let's this ramble on and no amount of tense violin music can compensate for what is just a lacklustre murder thriller."
36489,Bride of the Monster,4.0,"This is hilarious. Bela Lugosi once again assumes the role as the megalomaniac scientist. This time determined to create a race of atomic superhumans from his astonishingly well equipped forest cabin in the middle of nowhere so he can rule the world. After a while, the locals cotton on after spotting his ""monsters"" in the woods and a journalist and her cop fiancé are soon hot on his trail. Tor Johnson steals this as the monosyllabic ""Lobo"" - his sidekick; and there has to be special mention to the daftest looking rubber octopus ever to grace the screen. To be fair, I saw a colourised version (an act of sacrilege in itself) which I think accentuated all the negatives in what might have been a passable b&w effort, but in colour it just looked ridiculous."
36499,His Private Secretary,6.0,"This has quite a fun premiss to it. ""Dick"" (John Wayne) is a bit of a philanderer, the handsome but wastrel son of wealthy ""Mr. Wallace"" (Reginald Barlow). Uncharacteristically, the flighty young man alights on the respectable ""Marion"" (Evalyn Knapp), the grand-daughter of a small town preacher he meets at a petrol station and a whirlwind romance ensues. ""Dad"" is having none of this, and so it falls to the young girl to convince him she is not just after the family's money. On a visit to his building to demonstrate that his assumptions are wrong, she barges into his office. He likes her forthrightness and hires her as his secretary where she gradually makes herself indispensable (""Wallace"" still has no idea she is his son's new wife!) What's going to happen when he finds out...? The production is basic, as is the writing, but it's still quite a tightly cut, light-hearted, little story with just about enough charm to keep it going for an hour."
36517,Panic,6.0,"Lots of 1960s jazz-style music sets the tone for this disappointingly run-of-the-mill crime noir from John Gilling. Janine Gray works for a jeweller in London's famous Hatton Garden when she falls victim to a robbery that kills her boss and leaves her unconscious. She awakens with amnesia and in panic goes into hiding - not just from the pursuing police, but also from her boyfriend (Dyson Lovell) who is mixed up with the thieves. In her confusion, she encounters a boxer - Glyn Houston - who takes a shine to her and gives her shelter whilst she begins to piece it all together. It has more action - including a boxing match - than many of it's British counterparts and the acting is solid enough; but nothing much new to see here..."
36557,Casino Royale,3.0,"**2006 - the year they turned Bond into a common soccer hooligan.**

In 2006, the film makers - no longer under the watchful eye of the late Cubby Broccoli decided to run away from making James Bond movies. They also cast a short blonde man as 007.  They screwed with the gun barrel and the tone of the once lively, over the top and amusing series was now one of tedium.


It's all over for Bond films now unless they decide to make real Bond films again and not this monotonous  and bland rubbish.

It's  shame that Cubby was not still around to keep Eon Productions in line and stop them ruining 40 years of hard work.


- Potential Kermode"
36557,Casino Royale,8.0,"i liked Daniel Craig more as the right bond with action, charm, cunning all in one"
36557,Casino Royale,9.0,"Great James Bond movie and perfect debut for Daniel Craig. He may, at least in the last couple outings, resent the role, he makes for a bruiser version of the character. Pierce Brosnan is still my favorite as his movies came out in the 90s (i.e. the years for watching Bond movies), but this was an all around great film, not to mention the lovely Eva Green coming on to the scene. **4.5/5**"
36557,Casino Royale,8.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/casino-royale-spoiler-free-review

""Casino Royale is a near-perfect debut of Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. This brutal version of the famous protagonist is beautifully interpreted by Craig, who contradicted the naysayers at the time of release and delivers a phenomenal performance as the iconic 007. His witty humor, irresistible charm, and excellent line deliveries find a close match in Eva Green's take of the ""Bond girl"", whose intelligence and strong attitude puts aside any generic, formulaic traits. Mads Mikkelsen is outstanding as always as the vulnerable antagonist, but his impact on the overall picture is slightly underwhelming. The action set pieces are worthy of belonging to blockbusters of today, holding impressive stunt work and cinematography. Martin Campbell creates one of those films I can't pinpoint any flaws. Bond fans will feel delighted.""

Rating: A-"
36557,Casino Royale,10.0,"From the breathtaking stunts in the opening chase to the suspenseful high-stakes poker game, ‘Casino Royale’ gets everything right, introducing Craig as a tougher, grittier and more realistic Bond. James Bond.

10/10"
36557,Casino Royale,6.0,"It honestly wasn't bad and I really hate Daniel Craig as James Bond, he seems to be the only person on earth that does NOT want to be James Bond. And it kind of sucks watching someone play Bond that doesn't look like he wants to be there.

And then there is the fact that they rebooted the franchise, and I am not a fan of that either.

And, well, the film had 3 endings didn't it? I mean, literally there were two natural endings but they milked it for a third one. So by the time you get around to ending three you're screaming ""enough already!""

However, it started strong. I mean, it started REALLY strong even for a reboot. And it made the clever move of keeping the same M, and that helped stop the people like me that hate reboots from grumbling too much.

It did away with Q and the over-the-top gadgets and, yeah, Python Q wasn't good plus every Bond has his own feel.

So what was left was a solid action movie with mostly great acting (especially from the Villains) that was great... up until it SHOULD have ended the first time."
36557,Casino Royale,1.0,"Depressingly predictably Hollywood.
This is hardly a 007 movie, and can't be called a ""film"". It's just the same Hollywood formula of contriving a story to be as depressing as possible.
The same formula Hollywood had prided itself on since about 1965.
It's very dull, and there's no imagery.
007 films once had exotic scenery that was done in a cinematic way.
No more. 
This has absolutely nothing to do with Daniel Craig. It doesn't matter who plays 007 when the writer and director are control freaks for hatefulness.
If you can stay awake through the dull scenery and ridiculous lines (Bond even says it doesn't matter what cards you have in a poker game. This movie goes beyond ""retarded""), then you wonder what the plot is. Bond goes through a kidnapping ordeal and losing in cards, and he's obviously a victim of card cheating, but this genius doesn't suspect that.
Then, we get the predictable ending that is so Hollywood. 
This movie would be the worst Bond movie ever if not for ""A View to a Kill""."
36557,Casino Royale,10.0,This generally considered the best Bond film and for me it's top 3.
36561,I Am Dina,8.0,"Quite the absorbing flick.

I wouldn’t necessarily say ‘I Am Dina’ is a special film or anything, but I just really enjoyed the whole vibe of it from beginning to end - almost 2hrs well spent, in my opinion. Maria Bonnevie puts in an excellent lead performance, she is truly this 2002 release’s heartbeat. That’s not to say she’s alone in the good acting stakes, as others add positive showings as well.

Bjørn Floberg and Gérard Depardieu impressed me too, as do Mads Mikkelsen and Christopher Eccleston - I was surprised to see the latter appear onscreen, though he is more than solid throughout... iffy Russian accent aside, that is. Overall, in fairness, it's a strong cast.

It is very dramatic but I only mean that in the most positive sense. A lot happens but all of it feels like it fits what precedes and what follows. All in all, I would happily revisit this - well worth a watch."
36573,The Dirty Dozen: The Fatal Mission,6.0,"Third TV version of the story has Savalas back as the leader of 12 convicts on a desperate mission  to attack a train carrying a dozen Nazis selected to be the next generation of mad Reich leaders. After the usual training sequences and the traditional visit of the whores, Savalas learns there is a traitor in the team. It culminates in an explosive scene involving the train as a few of the twelve survive. Shot in Croatia, this has a very professional look and is hugely entertaining if violent and familiar fare. Unlikely addition of hot babe Thomas is a welcome diversion. The cast contains a number of tough guy, grizzled performers who easily fit into the rigorous action."
36583,Operation Crossbow,6.0,"If you're chute doesn't open, change it for a harp!

A passable WWII movie boosted by star casting and a grand finale. Plot essentially is about some Allied agents planning to infiltrate the Nazis' secretive rocket factory in Holland and destroy their deadly V rockets.

Much of the pic is given to character forming and painting political, army and human passion based groundwork. Unfortunately the narrative often sags and has some uneven patches that can take one out of the story line. On the plus side the finale is worth waiting for, full of suspense and heroics, while the espionage angle holds interest throughout. 6/10"
36583,Operation Crossbow,7.0,"Engaging war-thriller doesn't always hit on all cylinders but the finale was suspense-filled and I do appreciate how the filmmakers handled the deaths, not at all sensationalized. No real standout performances but the cast did a fine job, though a bit surprising to see Sophie Loren got top-billing but only in it for maybe 15-minutes. **3.5/5**"
36583,Operation Crossbow,6.0,"There is something a little bit reminiscent of ""The Adventures of Tartu"" (1943) about this film. The Nazis are using ever increasingly effective missiles to bombard South East England and when the boffins discover their new, portable, V1 and V2 rockets then a team is assembled to go into the heart of the Reich to carry out some dangerous sabotage. George Peppard, Jeremy Kemp and Tom Courtenay are the three despatched and these characters alongside an interestingly, but effectively, cast Anthony Quayle as their Nazi antagonist work well building a sense of peril as they set about their tasks. It's a little bit cluttered by a bit of a contrived sub-plot with Sophia Loren, but for the most part it is an efficient drama that has just about every British actor you can shake a stick at appearing somewhere - John Mills; Trevor Howard; Richard Johnson; Richard Todd et al. Of course it uses a little cinematic licence - Peppard's German accent (via Detroit) is a bit of a stretch at times - but it's still an engaging piece of wartime adventure cinema with quite an exciting climax."
36586,Blade II,8.0,"Blade II is the perfect marriage of fanboy and filmmaker. Everything you'd want out of a Blade movie - gore, martial arts, gunplay, clever quips, and techno music - is here to the nth degree. Best of all, it's filmed and choreographed with absolute mastery (thanks Donnie Yen!)

Guillermo del Toro never forgets to include his more artistic side. Detailed creature anatomy, amazing creature design, an understanding of where to put the camera, and great characters. It's all here.

Blade II is an incredible action picture and even though some of the CGI looks dated (it really just adds to the charm), Blade II is as exhilarating today as it was in 2002."
36586,Blade II,8.0,"**Blade II is more than just a good Blade or comic book movie. It's one of the best vampire films of the last 20 years.**

Blade II was a significant step up for the Blade franchise (and, unfortunately, the trilogy's peak) with a much more experienced director and a unique and exciting premise. This time the vampires are the prey and are desperate to survive the growing horde of vampire zombies, desperate enough to side with their sworn enemy, Blade, in hopes of surviving this plague. Both Blade and Blade: Trinity placed inexperienced directors at the helm, but Blade II put experienced horror and creature director Guillermo del Toro in charge, and the result was outstanding! Blade II has the most horror influence of the trilogy and the best story. Del Toro's involvement in all three films might have saved the series, but instead, we got the all-out action letdown of Blade: Trinity. Wesley Snipes was a perfect choice for Blade, and surrounding him with a cast that included Ron Pearlman, Tony Curran, and Donnie Yen (all experienced in the genre and with action) makes Blade II a top-notch vampire action comic book film."
36586,Blade II,8.0,Not as good as the 1st. Seems like it was less action. Movie was still good though.
36586,Blade II,6.0,"This time ""Blade"" (Wesley Snipes) joins forces with the vampire council to prevent the all-out eradication of the human and vampire species by the cross-breed ""Reaper"" that has such a rapacious hunger that it will devour just about anything to survive - no-one is safe! He allies with the ""Bloodpack"" and with ""Scud"" (Norman Reedus) on a quest to track down Luke Goss ""(Nomak"") who is the one creating these hybrid monsters, and to stop them before extinction beckons. This has quite a strong storyline, the characters are given some time to evolve and the chemistry between the rather static Snipes and Kris Kristofferson (""Whistler"") works well on the few occasions it is on screen - though not really well enough to compensate for pretty wooden performances from messrs. Goss and Reedus. As with the first film, the fight scenes are far too heavily staged; they rob the story of menace and the over-use of the soundtrack to accompany these extended, gory, slaughter-scenes really does reduce this to an almost cartoon status. It is good to look at, stylishly produced, but sadly nowhere near as good as the original."
36586,Blade II,7.0,"<em>'Blade II'</em> is a good follow-up to the 1998 predecessor. I'd personally say that the plot in this 2002 flick isn't as good, but is still entertaining in its own right and is portrayed by a stronger cast. Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes, brilliant. Behind him, Ron Perlman stands out.

I didn't know Norman Reedus was in this, love him in <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> - he elevates an otherwise forgettable character. Another favourite of mine is here too, as Matt Schulze of <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em> fame appears. I also recognised Karel Roden, who distractingly has his lines dubbed by a British actor - very odd!

Lastly, I have to commend the special effects. The majority of which is admittedly as passable as was the case for <em>'Blade'</em>, but the new addition of that effect for the reaper mouths is outstanding - it genuinely still holds up to today. Very impressive."
36593,Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult,7.0,"<em>'Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult'</em> is the weakest of the trilogy, though fair amusement is still produced.

Leslie Nielsen is so good in the lead role that I don't think it's really possible for these films to drag, at least alongside the decent gags and short run time. Admittedly this third entry does meander a tad, though my interest in events never waned into negative territory. The ending is the strongest part, that facepalm scene (which I knew of before) is gold.

Overall, this is a good franchise. I'm quite looking forward to hopefully checking out Liam Neeson in the 2025 remake, as long as the writing is suitable I think he can absolutely make it work."
36600,The Flesh and Blood Show,5.0,"Boobs, Butts and Blood - All Suffering Pier Pressure!

Pete Walker brings us a proto-slasher that's now as cornball as can be. Is it worthy of respect in the pantheon of horror? Yes, maybe.

This is a coastal town that they forgot to close down.

A group of actors and actresses have mysteriously been lured to an end of pier theatre to star in a play. Pretty soon they start being bumped off one by one.

So it be! There's plenty of nudity, actors siting around musing on the ""biz"" and its perils, while the matter of fact attitude to the disappearances is almost as ludicrous as someone opening the door in the middle of the night stark naked...

It's good fun in truth, especially for British film fans like me to see the likes of Robin Askwith and Jenny Hanley in this. The run down theatre setting is a good one, while the play they are rehearsing makes no sense and is quite surreal! 5/10"
36601,Grindstone Road,5.0,Not a bad movie. Just could have been better. I thought this would be a scary movie. The ending is decent though.
36611,"Quiet Please, Murder",7.0,"George Sanders (""Fleg) is up to no good in this light-hearted tale of theft and forgery. He has pinched an original Shakespeare folio and has been subsequently flogging copies. Unfortunately for him, his selling agent ""Myra"" (Gail Patrick) is none too bright and when she inadvertently sells one of his copies to a Nazi - their very lives are soon in peril, and it might actually be policeman ""McByrne"" (Richard Denning) who comes to their rescue! The acting is good, the writing quite pithy and it packs quite a lot into 70 minutes. Maybe the production is a touch basic; the settings are all a bit too static, but unlike so many of these cheap and cheerful B features, this one has a decent story that is actually quite enjoyable to watch."
36631,Never Let Go,6.0,"I'm afraid that I struggled with this... Richard Todd is ""Cummings"", a cosmetic salesman under pressure at work and at home, who finds his woes compounded when his new car is stolen. Determined to keep his job, and to find his car, he soon finds himself embroiled in the petty criminal world of a really poorly cast Peter Sellars (""Meadows"") - who really hams the part up and looks like he ought to be selling Tiramisu somewhere. What ensues is a really rather lacklustre, soap-opera style, effort from all concerned including the charming, but under-used Elizabeth Sellars as wife ""Anne"", Adam Faith as the pretty but useless bovver-boy ""Tommy"" and David Lodge as the crook's right hand man who doesn't look like he could pull the skin off a custard. The drama and the pace are all too forced, we don't really understand what is driving Todd's character (well, I didn't anyway) - his amiable, gentle persona becomes someone implausibly readily all-too-handy with a monkey wrench before an ending that was pretty scratchy. It's got a decent look to it, to be fair, but it did nothing for me, sorry."
36643,The World Is Not Enough,6.0,"Love Brosnan as Bond but man was he straddled with a bad script and even worse casting with Denise Richards playing a nuclear scientist. I get pre-Craig Bonds always had a tongue-in-cheek streak to them and ridiculous scenes (the opening boat chase was laughable once it went to the street) but this was a bridge too far (only to be outdone in a scene in Die Another Day). That said, there are some decent action set pieces and Brosnan still has the charm. **3.0/5**"
36643,The World Is Not Enough,1.0,"This begins the total collapse of Bond films.
We have the usual formula of beautiful women and lots of action, but here the action is very unmotivated.
Bond finds himself a body guard to a spoiled beauty queen, and we figure out early that the real heroine is the more matter of fact educated woman.
That's fair enough.
Still, everything that happens just looks contrived to make it end a certain way, with as depressing an ending as is allowed. That's the Hollywood formula, to make the world depressing for young men, and that's all they set out to do in this movie."
36647,Blade,5.0,"Blade is tons of fun, particularly when viewed through the nostalgic lens of 90s action cinema. It's also worth noting that the success of this movie - an R rated vampire flick with an African American lead - gave birth to the comic book movie era. The action, effects, and music are silly and dated, plus the story makes no sense. But Blade is nevertheless still fun."
36647,Blade,7.0,"Some good fight scenes and like Snipes in the role (reminded me of a time when he was trying) and Stephen Dorff was an okay villain, plus it was a serviceable plot. However, and I know this was 1997/98 when it was made, but the CGI at the end took me out of it (hell, good CGI done today takes me out of these sorts of films). But all in all, found it entertaining enough. **3.75/5**"
36647,Blade,10.0,"When this came out I thought it was the best vampire movie ever. Tons of action, fight scenes, and gore. I love how the vampires look when they die. One of my favorites!"
36647,Blade,6.0,"Wesley Snipes is ""Blade"" - an immortal half-breed charged with protecting mankind from the menace of the ever-peckish vampires with only his quirky sidekick ""Whistler"" (Kris Kristofferson) as an ally. Finally, the vampire council decide it is time to rid themselves of their nemesis and so ""Deacon Frost"" (Stephen Dorff) is tasked with bringing him down. I was always a fan of Dorff - never the best actor, but he had a bit of presence on screen - a good looking bit of rough, I suppose - and here is is a good counterpoint to the fastidious man-in-black whom he is out to destroy. The fight scenes are too choreographed for me, way too much acrobatics that detract from the menace of the story - it's supposed by about vampires, not rhythmic gymnastics - but it still moves along well as ""Frost"" tries to summon the blood god ""La Magra"" to give him the ultimate power to defeat our hero. This doesn't hang about, the action is fast-paced and the effects and characterisations gel quite well together for an enjoyable, if predictable story that is by far the best of the sequels it spawned."
36647,Blade,7.0,"<em>'Blade'</em> is not entirely what I expected. I had no clue this was about vampires, like at all. I evidently knew little about these films, I was anticipating a relatively standard yet stylish superhero flick - based upon the lead character's look, which is the only thing I knew of.

That's not a criticism, as the vampire stuff ended up being pretty fun to watch unfold. I will say that Wesley Snipes is the reason for that fact though, as Stephen Dorff and his band of one-dimensional renegades are only just narrowly watchable. Snipes as the titular character is excellent though, while Kris Kristofferson and N'Bushe Wright are good too.

The special effects haven't aged the best, though some parts are still decent and, to be honest, even the less than good pieces still work. For example the effect used when the vampires are killed looks fine, though the end with Frost's blood does look a bit dorky now - but again, works."
36648,Blade: Trinity,4.0,"It might (barely) have gotten one more star if it hadn’t been the third one in the Blade trilogy. As such it has some mighty good movies to live up to and that it doesn’t.

This time David S Goyer took to both write and direct the movie. I guess he should have stuck to script writing or something. The action scenes are not too bad. However, that’s all there is. Just a string of actions scenes barely strung together.

The worst offence of them all is Dracula. When I first learned that they brought in Dracula as the chief nemesis I thought that sounded cool. Wrong! Apart from a fairly cool look when he get really pissed off the film’s portrayal of Dracula is a joke. It’s an insult to the Dracula legends.

To sum it up, it’s 2 hours of not too bad action but a disappointment as a Blade movie."
36648,Blade: Trinity,8.0,"After watching all 3 of the Blade movies in a row, it gives a lot of perspective. The first was before all the Marvel boxoffice stuff took off, the second was having some Reaper stuff which was cool, but Trinity was the best in the series for sure. It needs better writing as Snipes has attested. We can tone down the Deadpool a bit and have more Wesley being a badass and not trail off into side projects. Whistler's family origins type things as well as Hannibal King's, but focusing more on Blade because he seriously can carry the whole film like he should have been doing since day 1."
36648,Blade: Trinity,2.0,"When a horror movie has to resort to vampire dogs, you know they're completely out of ideas. That's the least stupid part of Blade Trinity."
36648,Blade: Trinity,4.0,"TRINITY is not a good movie, instead it is a solid ""Blade"" movie -- meaning, if you are not already a fan, don't bother. Snipes no longer plays Blade for humor, as he did in the first Blade"
36648,Blade: Trinity,8.0,All 3 Blade movies are awesome in my opinion. This one is my favorite out of the series. It introduced at the time a different type and kind of vampire. This is movie is freakin' awesome.
36648,Blade: Trinity,5.0,"""Blade"" (Wesley Snipes) is now alone - surrounded by enemies bent on his destruction. Then, as luck would have it, he meets up with the ""Nightstalkers"", led by former vampire ""Hannibal King"" (Ryan Reynolds) and ""Abigail"" (Jessica Biel) who might just have developed a virus that could rid the world of vampires forever. To combat this threat, the vampires raise their king ""Drake"" (Dominic Purcell) and the battle lines are drawn in the ultimate fight for survival. Snipes is OK as a our leather-clad, mean, moody, hero but actually doesn't seem to feature so much - most of the action is driven by Reynolds who, whilst initially quite sarcastic and witty, rather overplays his hand and soon becomes just a bit too attitudinal; and Biel who appears to be on remote-control for much of her efforts. Purcell makes for quite a decent baddie, as does Parker Posey as ""Danica Talos"", though at times you do wonder if you should be shouting ""boo, hiss"" at the telly. There is plenty of fast-paced action throughout, but all in all this is just one, really pretty derivative sequel too many."
36657,X-Men,7.0,"X-Men is a milestone in cinema history. Without it being actually good and such a smash success, we wouldn't be enjoying the comic book movie world that rules the box office today.

The approach of X-Men was the right one. It told a relevant human story about prejudice, treating the source material respectfully and seriously. It's legacy may be greater than the actual movie, but X-Men is x-cellent!"
36657,X-Men,8.0,"<em>'X-Men'</em> is very good.

Another franchise I'm checking out for the first time, despite knowing about it for a number of years. This is a positive opener, there is a lot to feel entertained by for sure. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) is the star of the show, though Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) are solid too.

Intrigued to check out the sequels and the subsequent other productions.

36658,X2,7.0,"X2: X-Men United is an improvement over its predecessor in just about every way. Better story, better effects, better action, and more interesting mutants. It's the best of the original X-Men films and a high point for early 2000s comic book moviemaking. Worth watching for the Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike fight alone."
36658,X2,6.0,"Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

Again, horrible ""comic book movie"", good stand alone movie.

Wolverine was the most interesting thing about the last movie, and this is a surprising instance of a studio realizing audience feedback and basically just made the first Wolverine origin movie, because that's what this is.

Comic continuity aside, and Wolverine aside, the war of the Brotherhood of Mutants is fairly compelling angle to take, and it is refreshing they did it from the human's side, but if you look at it closer, then we're just looking at another race war.  It sort of takes the fuel out of the fire when you realize how ""real"" your super power problem story is.

While this has a slightly better premise, and good plot skeleton, there is a lot of ""(mostly Wolverine does) something cool here"" stuff, but there are at least 2 large exceptions with multiple mutants working together that end up being a ""lot of cool stuff"", but also add some significance to the story and heavily progress the plot.

I'd honestly recommend anyone watch this over the original."
36658,X2,8.0,"Strong sequel.

I didn't quite enjoy <em>'X2'</em> as much as <em>'X-Men'</em>, though not by much in truth. This follow-up film is still something I'd class as entertaining. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) again impresses, though those behind him are - though all good - a little meh in my opinion; especially newcomer Brian Cox (Stryker), who underwhelmed me.

All in all, it's a film that is totally worth watching and is a sequel that is worth its salt.

/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\"
36658,X2,9.0,"**X2 takes the X-Men far beyond the scope of the first movie with exciting new characters, manipulative villains, and bigger effects and stories.**

X2 forever stands as one of my favorite sequels of all time. It deepens its characters' backstories, expands the universe, increases the stakes, and creates new conflicts lasting beyond this franchise entry, promising more to come. The opening scene blew my mind when I first saw it and really showcased the power a single mutant could possess. The struggle between light and dark, both in humanity and mutants, was a theme throughout and highlighted in a multitude of ways. Exploring Wolverine's mysterious past and tying it into the overall conflict of the X-Men was a wise choice rather than having Logan search for answers alone. In addition, the women of the X-Men, Jean Grey and Storm, along with Mystique, saw more significant roles and character development. X2 was the Empire Strikes Back of the original X-Men trilogy- better in every way, with exciting new characters, threats, stories, and effects. X2 deserves a place as one of the greatest comic book movies and sequels of all time."
36668,X-Men: The Last Stand,7.0,"I'm surprised to see a big drop in average rating for this.

I enjoyed <em>'X-Men: The Last Stand'</em> to be honest. Taking a quick look at some other reviews and it seems to main gripe is how it treats certain characters from the comics, which is fair enough for sure but that doesn't come into play for me as I'm not a comic reader.

I can only judge it as a film and as one I found it suitably entertaining. Hugh Jackman remains the top dog, though at the beginning the way Wolverine acts felt off to me - though that quickly went away. I would've liked if they found a spot for Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), though one of his replacements in Beast (Kelsey Grammer) went down well with me.

From what I read I can understand other people's complaints with this, especially with the aforementioned iffy character treatment, but I gotta be honest and say that I found it to be a good enough watch - even if it is comparatively the weakest entry of the original trilogy.

36669,Die Another Day,8.0,"Most definitely the worst 'official' James Bond film I have ever seen (haven't seen 'The World Is Not Enough', 'Quantum of Solace' or 'Spectre' yet) but still has its moments, and like The Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd, even the bad stuff is better than 80% of the other stuff out there. Still I wish it wasn't Brosnan's last one--and though Craig was truly a refreshing change in his realistic tone that hearkened back to the great days of Connery, that too got old, even for the actor himself."
36669,Die Another Day,1.0,"This STANK.

The Fx were horrible for a Bond movie, especially one made in 2002... and that isn't even getting to the theme song yet. Madonna set the record for the all time worst Bond song in the history of Bond songs.

And she set the record for one of the all time worst Bond villains in franchise history.

It doesn't really feel like a Bond movie, it feels like a movie that was trying to make a mockery out of past Bond movies.

Nothing comes together, everything is just flat out horrible, and, in the end, you want it all to be over.

It's honestly worse than Moonraker"
36669,Die Another Day,7.0,"The last of the ""very good"" 007 films.
It isn't spectacular, but it works. 
There's intrigue, and lots of action, and the dynamics of the heroine-villainess and hero-villain are very good.
The ""gadgets"" are a bit sillier than usual, like the visible invisible car(?) but who cares?
The ""over the top"" action is always in every Bond film. Some films just don't try to lie about it. This one doesn't try to lie about it, so that also works.
This one has a lot of ""people aren't who they appear to be"", and there's a bit of detective work involved.
Still, it isn't a ""classic"" movie, but very watchable and entertaining, and very 007 with lots of action, scenery, women, and some attempts at wit, although wit is being crowded out in modern Bond films."
36669,Die Another Day,7.0,"You know how I said The World Is Not Enough was silly, that doesn't mean much if I like this."
36670,Never Say Never Again,1.0,"What were they thinking?
This stood for a while as the worst of the 007 series, although it's been outdone since then.
It's just too boring to be as Hollywood depressing as it tries to be.
Plot? You'll lose interest in the attempt to show a plot. It's a grand scheme to threaten the world, and Bond is there to save the day.
There's nothing wrong with Connery. It's the script. It's the direction. It's the monotony. It's the totally predictable Hollywood ideology.
It's a more ""Hollywood"" rendering of Thunderball. Here, we have it made for women. This is a chick flick 007 movie, with the heroine being the pale ""plain Jane"" that all women identify with. 
There is nothing memorable about this movie. You'll see that for yourself, if you watch it.
What were they thinking?"
36685,The Rocky Horror Picture Show,6.0,"I'm afraid to say that seeing this very recently on the big screen without an huge degree of audience participation showed the film up rather poorly for what is has has now become - tame! Barry Bostwick (""Brad"") and new wife Susan Sarandon (""Janet"") find themselves stranded in the kooky manor house of ""Dr. Frank N. Furter"" (the excellent Tim Curry) just as he is about to unveil his newest invention - the epitome of sexual perfection; every person's wet dream... ""Rocky Horror"" (Peter Hinwood). It doesn't take long for the corrupting influences to dazzle our naive newlyweds, and soon just about nothing is off limits. The superbly written, catchy songs are the stuff of movie legend, as it the marvellously camp contribution from Richard O'Brien (""Riff Raff"") but 45 years on, the innuendo-ridden script and gender-bending routines have lost almost all of their punch. As a cinema experience without good company, loads of noise, fishnets and red wine - it's all just a bit flat now."
36754,The Snorkel,6.0,"Right from the outset, we know what has happened to ""Mrs. Dexter"". We see the clever method by which she is gassed to death - but there is something a little bit ingenious about the fashion in which her husband ""Paul"" (Peter van Eyck) executes, quite literally, his wife. The police arrive, and finding the room locked and taped up assume quite naturally that she has taken her own life. Her daughter ""Candy"" (Mandy Miller) isn't buying it. For years she has been claiming that she saw him (her stepfather) kill her real father whilst boating, and now she is determined to get to the bottom of it all. What ensues isn't actually very good, nor is the rather underwhelming acting - but the last fifteen minutes presents us with a lovely sense of divine retribution that I thought salvaged the mediocrity of the rest of it rather well. It's a bit long, and way too wordy - but just stick around for the end and ask yourself what might you have done?"
36778,Spellbinder,8.0,"""Spellbinder"" draws most of its inspiration from the undisputed genre classic ""The Wicker Man"" (1973) and it manages to add a few extra touches of its own (the satanists making a blood sacrifice). It also draws some additional inspiration from Dennis Wheatley's classic ""The Devil Rides Out"" (1968) with the satanists relentlessly pursuing Miranda (Kelly Preston) after she has gone missing. However, this film also expertly misleads you throughout until the very end - the police arrive on the scene during the climatic action of the denouement, but not to arrest anyone. No, they are actually here to actively participate in the sacrifice of Jeff Mills (Timothy Daly) - and the director Janet Greek has done a splendid job and she has delivered a well paced and thoroughly engaging film."
36789,"Hook, Line and Sinker",5.0,"This starts off with Messrs. Wheeler and Woolsey nonchalantly riding their tandem when they are pulled over by a police officer. Moments later that have fast-talked their way into selling him insurance for just about everything and we are clued up for what to expect over the next 75 minutes. It turns out our two sweet-talkers could sell sand to the Saudis - and when they meet up with ""Mary"" (Dorothy Lee) who is on the run from her wealthy, overbearing, mother, they agree to help her run her ramshackle hotel that soon becomes a roaring success. That success is, however, based on a few false premisses -and that causes more that it's fair share of adventures and mis-haps. When it works, the partnership works well and it is funny and fast-paced, but it is far too long and after a while the comedy becomes wearisome and predictable."
36797,RocketMan,5.0,"I, somewhat weirdly, have no negative feelings about <em>'RocketMan'</em>. That's strange because the film is very bad, there is nothing I even marginally liked - and yet, I have no annoyance towards it. Odd.

I think what helps in that regard is the short run time and the fact that I do believe the actors were trying, they were just lumbered with a poor product. Harland Williams plays the role of Fred as well as anyone could have to be honest, while it's nice to see Jeffrey DeMunn - shoutout Dale, <em>'The Walking Dead'</em>.

The way the premise is brought to life is the biggest downside to this. It's cringe, predictable and lamely written. The more serious space ending is OK but doesn't fit the rest of the film's silliness at all. There aren't many, if any, laughs; for me at least. I did kinda rate the references to other films, e.g. <em>'Wizard of Oz'</em> and <em>'Pinocchio'</em>, but that's about it.

A harmless film, one I truly don't even have an ounce of hate for despite how bad it actually is."
36884,"No Retreat, No Surrender 3: Blood Brothers",9.0,Classic martial arts cheese from the 90s i adore this movie series and grew up watching these daily.. they dont make them like this anymore. Def needs a bluray or 4k upgrade.
36895,Suzaku,8.0,"I interpret this film as a slow, meditative thesis on the wabi-sabi of generational change. Like the fleeting cherry blossoms, the Japanese have reverence and respect for impermanence and imperfection. In the middle of the film, we heard an older man ask ""How will our young find someone to marry (if the railroad is not built)?"" Everyone is aware of the traditional village dissolving, yet only Kozo is unable to live with this. He disappears. Yasuyo moves away taking Machiko with her. Eisuke, who was, and still is, afraid of the ghosts in the tunnel (the past?) decides to remain in the village, perhaps only because the tradition of living with family still resides in him. We in the Western world do not seem to appreciate the trajectory of change in our own culture. Even viewed through the lens of our contemporary ADD, this film is good."
36923,Hot Boyz,7.0,"**Lowbudget rapsplotation flicks at it's finest.**

It's not ""good"" but it's entertaining, a No Limit Film (if you were into rap music in the late 90's you know about No Limit Records). 

Silkk The Shocker is a pretty terrible actor and he's got the lead but that is part of the what makes it entertaining.

Inspired by Scarface, Carlito's Way and those type of movies (albeit of course of lower quality).

Snoop Dogg and Master P are more background actors in this."
36929,Big Bully,6.0,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

I love getting in the ""way back machine"" and seeing Rick Moranis movies, and I'm not a big fan of Tom Arnold, but he nails this big dumb bully role.

There is a lot of establishing information, and they work really hard to express a parallel in parents vs children and projecting a ""break the cycle"" morale on the story, but most of the movie is just Tom being a jerk to Rick.  It's almost a Tom and Jerry movie.

I honestly spent a lot of the movie trying understand why Tom wasn't under arrest.

It's not the best movie, but it's reliably good.

If you're feeling an urge for a late 90's movie and this looks interesting, give it a shot."
36939,Boogie Woogie,4.0,"Bad watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.

There are so many good actors in this movie, and I watched it specifically because it was a movie with Amanda Seyfried about which I hadn't heard.  I understand that it had a point (sort of), but it did feel like there was somewhat unnecessary fan service with her and Heather Graham, and they are unfortunate highlights of the movie.

This is all about the ""art world"", which means it's not about art, the quality / value of at all: it's all about capitalism, so it becomes an business / politics movie.  It's all about these people we don't know or care about diddling each other and trying to out extort each other.

It would be more interesting if it was a nature documentary.

Watching rich people shuffle money about for no reason just isn't interesting to me.

And if I never hear Danny Huston laugh like that again, then my life will be better."
36940,The First Beautiful Thing,8.0,"Good comedy/drama about a dysfunctional Italian family and the memories of the eldest son.

Nice story, well told."
36947,Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media,10.0,"We have gone from Noam Chomsky, who famously said that you can only have one or two positions on free speech....to a left wing that wants to censor anything remotely offensive to them.

The left has gone from this wise old sage to spray painting ""Liberals get the bullet too"" at protests they are countering to squash free speech.

And its gotten to the point where Margaret Atwood had her feminist credentials stripped away, Howard Zinn passed away, anything that is disagreed with is labeled as hate speech...and anyone you disagree with is a Nazi that needs to be hit.

The old guard has died and a new insanity has taken its place.

We need Noam Chomsky back, we need his politics to return. We need that level-headed reason to come back into the left. Because, clearly, when we stop listening to people like him we open ourselves up for people like Stalin.

You need to watch this film, you need to pay attention to it, because right now the left is doing it wrong."
36949,99 River Street,7.0,"Like so many boxers before him, ""Ernie"" (John Payne) discovers that wealth and fame are fickle things. He loses an heavyweight fight and is soon driving a taxi to make ends meet. This does not sit well with his selfish and pretty nasty wife ""Pauline"" (Peggie Castle) who strays into the affections of the unsavoury ""Rawlins"" (Brad Dexter) with ultimately fatal results. ""Ernie"" finds himself suspect number one, and so must now try to piece together just what did happen and to stay one step ahead of the pursuing police just long enough to apprehend the real perpetrator. In my view, this is easily the best effort from Payne. He and Dexter work well to generate a sense of menace and desperation whilst a strong supporting cast with Evelyn Keyes (""Linda"") and Eddy Waller (""Pop"") do their level best to look out for the rather decent, frequently out of his depth boxer. The story develops slowly, but thoroughly, with a well paced dialogue and a score that helps Phil Karlson keep the tension building tautly towards the end that isn't quite as you might expect."
36955,True Lies,5.0,"I seem to like **True Lies** a significant amount less than most people do. And it's not because it isn't my type of movie either, Schwarzeneggar as a secret agent in an explosive 90s action movie is absolutely my jam. But I don't love _True Lies_, maybe I saw it too late in life (I was 25 the first time I saw the whole movie) and either I aged out of it or the movie aged out of society, but whatever the case, I just can't really understand why it's so beloved. I would never take it away from anyone, and there's absolutely stuff I like, but I can't really recommend it based on personal taste. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
36972,Scooby Goes Hollywood,1.5,"I really cannot fathom what the writers were thinking on this one.  Few movies reach this level of crossover failure like Star Wars Holiday Special.  It's a hodge-podge of rehashed Three Stooges, clips of older episodes, and Snoopy Come Home.  I believe they were trying to see if Scooby would ever work without monsters, mystery and for the most part, the rest of the gang.  The only audience I can think of that might enjoy this is perhaps a 3-year old who likes the dog but finds regular Doo too scary.  Even still, they would get none of the supposed 'jokes' referring to old campy tv shows."
36986,Angels in the Endzone,5.0,"Boring, mainly thanks to its copied main premise from the first film of this remake trilogy.

<em>'Angels in the Endzone'</em> is a lame watch. I do appreciate the switching up of the backstory for the sporting events, but even then they don't exactly create a fresh, new plotline or anything - it's hearty, but something we've all seen before. The simple change from baseball to American football isn't sufficient.

The overall acting, though a big drop from the 1994 production, is actually pretty solid, even if none of the cast particularly stand tall in my memory. Christopher Lloyd is again underused, not that I blame him for not committing fully to this - the cheek to put him on the cover, by the way. Of the main, more used cast members, Paul Dooley is probably the standout.

A disappointing sequel to <em>'Angels in the Outfield'</em>. Here's hoping for an improvement from <em>'Angels in the Infield'</em> - I'm an optimist!"
37026,Mrs Caldicot's Cabbage War,8.0,"This was an entertaining and amusing little comedy. It was fairly well-written, except for cliched bad people here and there. The time shifts were also a little awkward at the beginning, but that cleared up after a bit.

The cast included a half-dozen familiar British performers that I have seen in previous tv shows. Pauline is a treasure and a pleasure to watch.

I was wondering how they would come up with a satisfactory way of wrapping up the film, but they thought of a believable one that hadn’t occurred to me.

If it weren’t for the cliched scenes and characters I would be willing to watch it again. As it is I didn’t regret the time spent on it."
37103,"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison",7.0,"This is a great but underrated movie. Just because there aren't a lot of actors, the relationship between the two main characters is a wonderful thing to watch. It's too bad the other actors of note are not listed, such as I. Miynai, S. Nakagawa, Akiro Ohno and Masao Ukon.  It's worth watching."
37126,Impulse,5.0,"Though it is short and sweet, Cy Endfield still struggles with this slightly contrived British murder/mystery. The rather wooden Arthur Kennedy (""Curtis"") meets the glamorous ""Lila"" Constance Smith) in an hotel bar whilst his wife ""Elizabeth"" (Joy Shelton) has gone away for the weekend. After what seems like the briefest of introductions, he forgets any semblance of the sanctity of his marriage vows and as a result gets tangled up with some murderous diamond smugglers before a predictable ending. It's not a great example of the genre, more a rather stodgily paced vehicle for a visiting American star."
37135,Tarzan,8.0,"<em>'Tarzan'</em> is one of those films that I had always assumed I had seen, though evidently I hadn't and this was my first time watching. It's a cracker!

Phil Collins' music is tremendous, it truly adds a lot to the film - ""Son of Man"", which I already knew about, is a great song which works very well with the montage. Some of the editing is rather sharp, while the animation is pleasing on the eye.

Tony Goldwyn (Tarzan) and Minnie Driver (Jane) suit their respective roles nicely, as do Glenn Close (Kala) and Brian Blessed (Clayton). Rosie O'Donnell is the one I enjoyed most, as she portrays Terk - which isn't really a massive character, yet O'Donnell makes her memorable.

It does feature things you've seen from earlier jungle based films, like 1967's <em>'The Jungle Book'</em> and, as expected yet still amusingly, 1997's <em>'George of the Jungle'</em>. The early scenes in-particular, which rely firmly on Collins' music - from the midway point it's more level, whilst also taking its own route with this type of story.

I'm interested to find out where the two follow-up films go."
37135,Tarzan,7.0,"""Tarzan"" is rescued from the clutches of a tiger and raised in a colony of gorillas. As he gets older, he bonds with the animals around him and ultimately, with a few reservations from the alpha ""Kerchak"", becomes an internal part of the family. Enter a group of British explorers determined to see gorillas and our hero see ""Jane"" for the first time: the love story begins. Their guide ""Clayton"" betrays them all - he wants to sell the apes for £300-a-head in Europe and a colourful, perilous battle of ""civilisations"" ensues. The animations are a bit simple, vey angular - but the characterisations are much stronger. It isn't just a love story with an happy ending; we are taken on their journey of self-discovery as they both introduce the other to their own, drastically, different worlds... Great vocal efforts from Brian Blessed, Minnie Driver and Nigel Hawthorne add some extra fun and lots of pace to this action adventure complemented by a few good songs from Phil Collins."
37136,The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,10.0,"One of the funniest and most politically incorrect movies ever made, and yes it's more than a bit crass... The laughs come rapid-fire and never let up for an instant. Leslie Nielsen is brilliant, and within 15 minutes or so you feel you know Frank Drebin inside and out. The supporting cast is also excellent, notably Ricardo Montalban and Priscilla Presley. There are too many hilarious scenes to even think of listing here, but unless you are easily offended, you are guaranteed a great time with this one. Be sure to seek out the 2 sequels, as well as the ill-fated TV series Police Squad, which inspired this comic masterpiece.   "
37136,The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,8.0,"<em>'The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!'</em> is very well done. Amusing viewing!

Leslie Nielsen kills it in the lead role, I hear that Liam Neeson is doing the remake next year and, you know what, I can see it. O. J. Simpson and Priscilla Presley are quite the interesting other cast members, while George Kennedy is a good fit for his role alongside Nielsen. Ricardo Montalbán works well too.

I do like this sorta dry slapstick comedy, where the gags are constantly scattered throughout without being overtly pointed out by those onscreen. I also prefer this to ""ZAZ""'s work from eight years prior in <em>'Airplane!'</em>, I'd say this one has better humour and a better story to accompany it.

I hope the sequels were as good!"
37136,The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,8.0,"""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!"" continues the tradition established by the enormously successful ""Airplane!"" (1980) and it is a fast paced comedy where the unceasing stream of wacky and off-beat humour works a treat. The filmmakers have turned their attention to cop movies for inspiration this time around and instead of lampooning such films the ridiculous set-piece sequences on offer here are broader in nature and they don't really reference any film releases of the period at all, but this doesn't particularly matter because the vast array of visual and verbal gags come at such a rate you never really have much of an opportunity to analyse whether they hit the intended target or not and a second viewing confirms they really do."
37137,The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear,7.0,"Not as good as the first time, but <em>'The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear'</em> still delivers entertainment.

Leslie Nielsen remains brilliant as Lieutenant Frank Drebin, such a fun character to see him play. George Kennedy and Priscilla Presley do well, while Richard Griffiths and, slightly less so, Robert Goulet are positive newcomers. I will say that I don't think the comedy is as strong in this one, the gags in particular seem a little more in your face with additional winks and nudges.

Still a good time, though. Now to find out what <em>'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult'</em> had to offer..."
37141,The Babysitter,3.0,"Well, Alicia Silverstone does a good job. Have to give her that.

But, this is pretty much ""The Crush"" only with a much worse cast, a slightly different plot that still follows the lolita theme, and a the worst possible execution possible.

I believe the plot summary is that a man and his children all have a thing for the babysitter... and that is just about all you need to know.

Films like this you expect tension, something that keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes a knot in the muscles on your back. Tension that is both sexual and fatal.

Instead it pushes for an eroticism that is never really achieved and any feelings of peril are absolutely void. The cover suggests enough, but in the end the mood never gets there enough to make it an enjoyable watch."
37144,True Crime,6.0,"Alicia Silverstone: Teen sleuth 

RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 1995/1996 and written & directed by Pat Verducci, ""True Crime"" (aka “Dangerous Kiss”) is a mystery/crime/teen/romance starring Alicia Silverstone as a Catholic school senior in California who befriends a police cadet (Kevin Dillon) to solve a case of serial killings of young women. Their investigations lead them to a traveling carnival. Bill Nunn plays the girl’s detective friend and the cadet’s boss. 

This came out right after Alicia’s breakthrough flicks “The Crush” (1993) and “Clueless” (1995) and, while entertaining for what it is, it pales by comparison. The main problem isn’t the cast, locations or excellent percussion-oriented score, but rather the script; and, more specifically, who the killer turns out being. With just a couple imaginative tweaks this could’ve been a very satisfying teen mystery à la Nancy Drew, but with considerable edge. Still, Silverstone makes it agreeable, along with the other highlights noted. If you like those other two flicks, this is a must.        

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA. 

GRADE: B-"
37165,The Truman Show,8.0,"**""The Truman Show""** dares to question the reality. It's original, complex, and philosophical. It manages to make you feel truly frustrated and **claustrophobic**. 

Perhaps many of us can relate to Truman as we live in a time of routines. We often live our lives without giving a second thought to the simplicity and meaninglessness of life itself. Our limited perspectives keep us from seeing. The lies we are told keep us from the truth. If we could push the boundaries of our reality, what are the odds that we'd face what Truman faced in the end?

It was a joy to watch **""Jim Carrey""** as **""Truman""**, it is yet another proof that Jim isn't just a comedian."
37165,The Truman Show,8.0,"In a world experimenting with big brother reality shows and questioning what is real in a mtrix kind of way, The Truman Show is a splendid and well executed movie about a man owned by a corporation from birth, who lives on the set while not being aware of the fact that everything around him is fake. Brilliant Jim Carey."
37165,The Truman Show,9.0,"Such a well executed plot. So much fun to watch.

Jim Carrey, an actor I always enjoying watching, is terrific in the lead as Truman - he kills every moment, very much the perfect person to play this role. Laura Linney (Hannah), Ed Harris (Christof) and Noah Emmerich (Louis) are the best of the rest, while Paul Giamatti (Simeon) even appears.

<em>'The Truman Show'</em> is one of those films that I've heard a great deal about down the years so I'm happy to have finally got around to seeing it. It's excellent. It's well paced and just a really entertaining and thoughtful premise to watch unfold. Brilliant film."
37165,The Truman Show,9.0,"Seen this one numerous times, including in the theater, and still holds up so well, and is engrossing from beginning to end. It was the first time seeing how versatile Jim Carrey was. Just a great all around movie. **4.5/5**"
37165,The Truman Show,7.0,How the heck did they make so much money off advertisements?!
37181,About Elly,9.0,"Great drama in which a ball of lies hit back to the main characters once and again.

The suspense is greatly kept while we attend to the limitations and roles imposed by culture and social conventions. In several ways, a movie setting the path for the next one: ""A Separation""."
37204,Summer Magic,6.0,"Another one to put in the 'meh' category of live-action Disney.

<em>'Summer Magic'</em> isn't entertaining. You have Hayley Mills (Nancy), Burl Ives (Osh) and Dorothy McGuire (Margaret) all giving alright performances but most others things in this film are very plain.

The musical numbers are forgettable, as is the overall premise and supporting cast under Mills, Ives and McGuire. I have most definitely seen worse from the studio, this is still at least watchable. Going back to the plot, it just feels a bit slapped together without much thought or solid connection. The film ends quite abruptly, too.

1963, it's safe to say, wasn't Disney's strongest year for live-action. This adds to the disappointments of <em>'Son of Flubber'</em>, <em>'Miracle of the White Stallions'</em> and <em>'Savage Sam'</em>. Here's hoping <em>'The Incredible Journey'</em> will conclude their releases from these twelve months on a high."
37222,The V.I.P.s,7.0,"Beaten by a bloody fog!

The V.I.P.s is directed by Anthony Asquith and written by Terence Rattigan. It stars Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Louis Jordan, Rod Taylor, Maggie Smith, Orson Welles, Elsda Martinelli and Margaret Rutherford. Filmed in Panavision and Metrocolor, music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography by Jack Hildyard.

Terminal 2, London Heathrow Airport, and fog has grounded the flights of some very important people. Time, then, for truths to out and futures resolved...

Cheque book generosity.

Disliked by critics upon release but a hit at the box office, The V.I.P.s is a throwback to the days when ensemble star power could carry a melodrama through to its conclusion. The performances of the actors, playing well to do characters facing up to some tribulations in life, are most enjoyable (nice to see Rod Taylor actually being Australian, Smith owning the film and Rutherford being Rutherford) and even though there's some silly moments within Rattigan's screenplay, there's enough quality drama and warmth to make the near two hour running time bearable. Besisdes, I never thought the sight of Richard Burton signing a cheque could make me feel so happy! 7/10"
37227,Of Unknown Origin,5.0,"_**The Rat from Hell**_  

A Manhattan executive (Peter Weller) deals with the rats on Wall Street while defending his brownstone ‘castle’ against a literal vermin. Jennifer Dale plays his secretary while Lawrence Dane and Kenneth Welsh are on hand as colleagues.

""Of Unknown Origin"" (1983) strikes me as a Stephen King yarn, which makes sense when you figure that this is one of the horror author’s favorite flicks. 

While the compare/contrast of the protagonist’s life in his home-castle with the rat maze at work is interesting, the premise is too light IMHO to carry a feature film: a man vs. a rat alone in his gothic abode. Weller works well as the resolute hero but, for me, the best thing about it is winsome Jennifer Dale (Cynthia Dale's older sister).

Gene Simmon’s wife, Shannon Tweed, makes her feature film debut in a small role.  

The film runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot in Montreal. 

GRADE: C"
37257,Witness for the Prosecution,8.0,Great thriller with superb classical interpretations. The plot moves sometimes too lazily.
37257,Witness for the Prosecution,8.0,"I might be asking for trouble here, but did Charles Laughton ever actually make a bad film? He leads this one as the brilliant but curmudgeonly barrister ""Sir Wildred Robarts"" with oodles of charisma and style. Marlene Dietrich portrays the evil, manipulative ""Christine Vole"" marvellously and even Tyrone Power, more the matinée idol than the serious actor, delivers as required in Billy Wilder's outstanding rendition of the Agatha Christie story about a man accused of murdering an elderly lady who has just happened to leave him a great deal of money in her will. Elsa Lanchester is suitably annoying/scary/lovable as the nurse trying to keep her ailing charge from keeling over mid-trial and a slew of other capable British actors - including a wonderfully charismatic turn from Una O'Connor in the witness box -  fill in the supporting roles well. It is one of those very rare occasions where everything just gels perfectly and it really is fun to watch. Some of Laughton's wry asides and put-down lines are genuinely laugh out loud too. Had it not come up against ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" then I'm sure it would have garnered at least one Oscar!"
37302,Left Behind,1.0,"Well, I was born and raised Catholic...and I'm still Catholic...and this is the kind of movie I avoid.

I really don't want to sit down and be preached at, I don't want to watch an overt lecture. And, trust me, that goes just as much for the left as it does the right.

But, when the heck, it was free so...I finally came around to watching it and, honestly, YES, it totally does feel like an overt political and religious lecture. And, unfortunately, for some reason, when the conservatives do it the production value is absolute crap and it looks pretty horrible.

And lest when the liberals do their propaganda (I'm looking at you Star Wars, Captain Marvel, Disney, Sabrina) they actually put money into it and make it look good. Even though the stories are just as bad.

But, I guess the good news is that when conservatives do their propaganda they don't even try to conceal it.

What we have here is a lecture with poor production values and, yeah, the acting was pretty OK.

At least I can say that most of the acting was decent."
37308,100 Rifles,7.0,"Rifles or Trifles?

100 Rifles is directed by Tom Gries and Gries adapts to screenplay with Clair Huffaker from Robert MacLeod's novel The Californio. It stars Burt Reynolds, Jim Brown, Raquel Welch, Fernando Lamas and Dan O'Herlihy. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Cecilio Paniagua.

Arizona lawman Lydecker (Brown) travels into Mexico to arrest bank robber Yaqui Joe Herrera (Reynolds), and lands in the middle of a war between the Yaquis and the Mexican army. 

A good blood pumping Oater feasting on Spaghetti leanings, 100 Rifles boasts star appeal coupled with exciting genre staples. Filmed in Almeria in Spain, pic doesn't lack for smooth on the eyes locations either. The dialogue is a mixture of cheese and the philosophical, but it sits well in the production. It's strong on violence, with a number of action sequences very well constructed, while it has a cheeky glint in its eye and for sure is sexy into the bargain. OK, so the cast aren't exactly pulling up any trees, but they are fun to watch as we take in weasel villains and lovable rogues.

Good time to be had here. 7/10"
37327,Wagon Master,6.0,"This is quite an unremarkable little pioneering yarn that sees two cowboys - Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. guiding a Mormon caravan across the Wild West. En route they encounter a motley collection of folks with a medicine show - and the sultry Joanne Dru (""Miss Denver""); then a bunch of less savoury characters led by Charles Kemper (""Shiloh Clegg"") before they are invited to join some Navajo at their camp - and that's where it all turns a bit sour with our two gallant lads left to try to protect the travellers from the vengeful ""Cleggs"". John Ford seems to have lost his way with this pretty fluffy amalgam of stories; there's way too much singing and not enough action - and it lacks an anchor; either a John Wayne or a Henry Fonda - someone just to inject some strength of character to it. Even the score drifts along aimlessly, too. Ward Bond and Hank Worden do their best to keep the ""Rio Grande"" spirit flowing, but it's all just a bit too tepid."
37347,Fort Apache,7.0,"Certainly, I think, the best of the John Ford US cavalry trilogies this one. Henry Fonda is cracking as the honourable, but out of his depth, by-the-book colonel sent to run a ramshackle army post just as the Apache are on the rise again. He replaces the far more practically experienced John Wayne and soon it all gets a bit sticky. John Agar and Shirley Temple provide an amiable romantic sub-plot as the very green lieutenant son of the Sergeant Major (Ward Bond) and the daughter of the Colonel who fall in love - despite the disapproval of (for different reasons) both sets of parents. The photography is, as usual, quite stunning - George O'Brien; Pedro Armedáris, Dick Foran and the inimitable Victor McLaglen all contribute hugely (and frequently humorously) to a tight little, and occasionally quite thought-provoking, Frank Nugent screenplay and the Admiral maintains a decent degree of jeopardy - between the two, on-form, leads and between them and the Apache - until the very, gallant, end. It's held up remarkably well, nodding subtly - but distinctly - to the appalling way the native American tribes were treated during the pioneering, expansion of the United States."
37377,The Glory Guys,6.0,"This is way too long, but maybe the absence of a star to top the billing gives the plot a little more of a chance, and the story is OK. It's a not unfamiliar love triangle type of tale - with soldiers ""Harrod"" (Tom Tryon) and ""Rogers"" (Harve Presnell) vying for the affections of the rather fickle ""Lou"" (Senta Berger) who seems to me quite adept at stringing both men along quite nicely. Once we escape from the rather dull romantic elements, the action sequences as both men have to put their hormonal differences aside and focus on the marauding Sioux start to hot up, and soon we've got a decent amount of whooping and tomahawk throwing as the army and the natives square up for quite a conflagration. It's colourful and entertaining once it gets going and though it offers little new, it is still a well produced and photographed western which with some pruning (almost all of the romance could go for a start) would still make for a decent cavalry story."
37380,Thunder Bay,7.0,"Boiling Oil.

Thunder Bay is directed by Anthony Mann and written by Gil Doud and George W. George. It stars James Stewart, Joanne Dru, Dan Duryea, Gilbert Roland and Jay C. Flippen. Music is by Frank Skinner and cinematography by William H. Daniels.

Offshore oil drillers set up base at Port Felicity, Louisiana and find the town’s shrimpers are not at all happy about this threat to their livelihood. Conflict and affairs of the heart do follow.

One of the eight films that James Stewart and Anthony Mann made together, Thunder Bay was relevant in topicality upon its release, and remains so today. Whilst lacking the psychological smarts that the duo’s Western productions had, it’s a handsome production with the expected qualities in front of and behind the cameras. There’s a lot of talky passages, which given the subject matter pulsing away at the core is understandable, but Mann ensures that action and suspense is never far away. It all builds to a crescendo, with loose ends and quibbles conveniently tied up in a Hollywood bow, but such is the skills of actors and director it rounds out as good and thorough entertainment. 7/10"
37423,Fly Girls,8.0,"Fly Girls is one of the top 10 of Digital Playground's best films.
My fav scene is where the couple seduce the airport security."
37430,Conan the Barbarian,4.0,"There's some cathartically pleasant violence, particularly in the first half, but ultimately this movie didn't have to be made, and it *definitely* didn't have to be made under the name ""_Conan_"".

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
37430,Conan the Barbarian,7.0,"I quite liked this film, more than I liked Captain America: The First Avenger that we watched a couple of days ago. It has gotten some rather disappointing ratings. I obviously disagree.

I found the film to be pretty much what I hoped for. I read some reviews on IMDb stating that Conan only said about 40 words, that he wasn’t “barbaric” enough, that the fight scenes where chopped up and that you didn’t get to see much of the fighting.

In reality the first statement is a blatant lie and the others simply not true. The film is much bloodier than Schwarzenegger’s version and sometimes in a quite “barbaric” way. I do not know what people really expected from this film but for me it was pretty much what I hoped for. Although the Schwarzenegger films are somewhat out-dated I was still afraid that I would miss good old Schwarzy but I really didn’t (that much at least).

Special effects where quite okay and the 5.1 DTS Master Audio soundtrack was done well enough. It get’s a 7 out of 10 from me."
37430,Conan the Barbarian,2.0,"This is terrible, poorly executed, story makes no sense. Costume design is nice but it's not enough to sanction just under 2 hours of my life.  Unless you are a child or an easily impressed adult, Avoid!"
37441,The Ape Man,4.0,"Bela Goes Ape!

William Beaudine directs and Bela Lugosi stars in this cheapie horror that finds Lugosi as a mad scientist who has transformed himself into an ape man hybrid. Cue more mad science as Lugosi and his pet gorilla go on a killing spree in search of the spinal fluid that may cure Lugosi of his ills...

It's not to be taken seriously, of course, since it's all very goofy and over melodramatic. Lugosi does turn in some genuine moments of acting that hold the attention, whilst an array of energetic characters buzz in and out of the story. The science is nutty and the means and motives of Lugosi's initial experiments are left floating up where Dandelo the cat would eventually wind up. But it's a short piece that doesn't hang around to annoy or dull the senses, it's not very good, but at least it isn't boring with it. 4/10"
37468,The Big Lift,6.0,"This is certainly an authentic, atmospheric looking depiction of immediately post war Berlin as the erstwhile allies start carving up the spoils of victory. The story focusses on Monty Clift as ""Danny"", a flight engineer working for the US Air Force as the Soviets blockade all ground-based access to the bombed out city, and his pal Paul Douglas (""Kowalski"") and follows their various escapades, loves and adventures during the short period of the siege. The story itself isn't really up to much and Clift always suited me better in a cowboy hat than in a military one - somehow he just isn't a particularly plausible soldier. Douglas, on the other hand has much more of a backstory to get our teeth into - his time in a POW camp has hardened his attitude to the German people (though the odd fling isn't entirely out of the question). There is some good aerial photography and that helps keep it interesting for a while, but at two hours long, the plot and characters start to wear quite thin and it begins to look more like a propaganda exercise for domestic consumption. Still, fans of Clift ought to enjoy it."
37484,I Love Trouble,6.0,"This is quite a complex tale of murder, blackmail and impersonation. Wealthy Tom Powers (""Johnston"") hires private investigator Franchot Tone (""Bailey"") to investigate his wife. The digging reveals she had rather an unsavoury past as a dancer who hooked up with an actor and had pinched $40k from her old employers. She turns up dead under Malibu pier and Tone is soon prime suspect for Robert Barrat's ""Lt. Quint"". It moves along efficiently, with plenty of twists and turns and the support from the two ladies Janet Blair and Janis Carter as well as from John Ireland and a very brief appearance by Raymond Burr keep this drama running well - except, that is, for Tone. He is dreadful - a good looking man with all the charisma of a cheese plant; and virtually no natural abilities with the camera at all. It is also far too long - could have lost 20 minutes without detracting from the plot in any meaningful way. Worth a watch, though."
37534,The New Daughter,4.0,"This is quite close a B series movie. Nothing unexpected, the creatures a laughable and the FX virtually non-existent.

Maybe you can save the performance from both children, Baquero and Griffith, but that's it."
37653,The Three Brothers,10.0,One of the best french movies. It is certainly the best movie memory of my childhood. I still use many funny phrases from the movie in my day-to-day life. Thanks for this chef-d'oeuvre of fun and emotions.
37686,Super 8,5.0,"Unsuccessful children movie trying to follow the tradition of The Goonies or E.T. from overrated J.J. Abrams.

Tons of money are wasted on FX trying to hide a weak story and a set of terrible dialogues supposedly coming from children that are totally overacted and annoyingly always shouting.

You don't miss anything if you skip Super 8."
37686,Super 8,5.0,"I kind of liked the making-a-movie-within-the-movie aspect of _Super 8_ a lot more than the chief plot with the monster and the train and the badman government and the blah blah blah. Which isn't ideal, but saying that obviously means I liked something about it.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
37707,Splice,5.0,"The FX is OK and the uneasiness and thrill is always there but the script is stereotypical, weak and full of holes."
37724,Skyfall,8.5,"Skyfall is a great movie. In my opinion the best proformas by Daniel Craig I have see in all his Bond movies. The title song was not to my taste like in previous movies. The story line is one of the most compelling I have seen in a while. Silva, played by Javier Bardem was excellent and he played him very well. All in all a very good movie."
37724,Skyfall,8.0,"Great theme song and a much more balanced movie compared to Quantum of Solace, and the story is well written, revealing Bond's background and the motherly relationship with M (contrast with a more antagonistic portrayal in the Brosnan series). Javier Bardem as the villain was fantastic, almost Joker like in his planning. The only setback is the finale, sure some nice action and explosions but not quite as thrilling versus Casino Royale. Still, one of the better in the Bond series overall. **4.0/5**"
37735,Easy A,7.0,"Fresh comedy. Sometimes funny, but not too much. The cast is good and I like Emma Stone a lot, but she cannot pass as a high school student any more.

It could have been much better if the story would have worked better, in spite of the sometimes brilliant dialogues."
37735,Easy A,6.0,"Pretty far removed from my wheelhouse, but Emma Stone makes for such a great lead, the banter-y dialogue given to the adult roles (most masterfully spoken by Stanley Tucci) is so hilarious, and the story flows so naturally from A to B to C that you can't stop for long enough to question the flaws while you're watching it, that there was no way I couldn't at least give Easy A a passing grade (no pun intended).

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._"
37799,The Social Network,7.0,"Eisenberg was probably born for this role.

The story is well threaded and you don't get bored until the end. A decent movie."
37818,The Allnighter,6.0,"Not great even in regards to this sort of genre, but it's light-hearted enough and I did like Susanna Hoffs (from the Bangles) in the lead even if the dialogue was pretty poor at times. But for what it is, I thought it was okay. **3.0/5**"
37821,Killers,8.0,This was a surprising good movie. They tried to be like a little bit of Mr. & Mrs. Smith though. Still a pretty decent movie and funny.
37834,Knight and Day,3.0,"OMFG! I thought MIssion: Impossible 2 was the worst movie I would watch from Tom Cruise ... I was wrong.

There's only one thing in Knight and Day that is not that bad as in MI2, and it is that the movie doesn't take seriously itself, something that MI2 does.

About the mixing of Spanish stereotypes and festivities in Seville ... no comments :("
37865,Buried Alive,7.0,"Entertaining enough made-for-cable TV movie moves at a brisk pace and has a great finale. Good performances from the three main cast members with Tim Matheson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and William Atherton (surprise surprise plays a scumbag) makes this worth checking out (saw it on Blu-ray from Kino Lorber). **3.5/5**"
37935,One Dark Night,7.0,"Decently made supernatural-horror film with some great make-up and visual effects. The performances are pretty standard but did like Meg Tilly in the lead. A bit slow in the middle but once things pick up for the third act, it's a lot of fun. **3.5/5**"
37950,Charlie St. Cloud,6.0,Pretty good movie. Kind of like the sixth sense. In this case though he can see them in spirit when they are close to death. Uses it to help people.
37958,Immortals,3.0,"Total failure of doing a movie with the aesthetics and success of ""300"".

Mediocre story, bad planned action scenes, tons of Fx, poorly developed characters and tons of stereotypes."
38006,The Abominable Snowman,8.0,"This was entertaining to watch, especially it being the first Hammer Horror filmed in black and white.

An adventurous expedition turns into a fight for survival, with a horrifying discovery. It's similar to The Thing and Mountains of Madness, but the difference being it is less gruesome than the other two."
38117,Beastly,3.0,"A bloke has a curse placed on him where he learns that instead of being mean, he can be creepy.

Absolutely nobody on the planet would behave like a single one of these characters, and if that weren't the case, this movie would still suck. Gets the extra star for LisaGay Hamilton & Neil Patrick Harris who, though still ridiculous, are at least endearing.

(Also he's way hotter as The Beast).

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._"
38157,Wishmaster 4: The Prophecy Fulfilled,3.0,"Director Chris Angel needs to remember when he chops body parts off of his characters, to ensure that they don't still have them when the angle changes.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
38360,The Cranes Are Flying,10.0,"This was an equally outstanding and heartbreaking film. I haven't watched a lot of Soviet cinema, but from what I have seen thus far, it's terrific. It makes me want to investigate their oeuvre ever more diligently. Essential if you're interested either in Soviet films or war films in general, from the perspective of the people on the sidelines as well. Don't think for a moment they can't be just as shellshocked as the soldiers-in-arms themselves..."
38360,The Cranes Are Flying,8.0,"Everything in this movie is technically perfect. In spite of that, the idea that a woman must pick the best man available really dates this movie for me."
38365,Grown Ups,8.0,Great movie. This is how grown ups like to party. My family would fit right in with these guys.
38387,The Early Bird,5.0,"I was not familiar with these comedians until now and this is the only movie I've seen in the series. I would have thoroughly enjoyed watching them in the 60's in my youth but the comedy is slapstick and more suitable for young kids and the nostalgia crowd. I will admit that there were some very amusing scenes even for someone like me in their golden years. Interestingly, the other reviews were mixed, some saying this was the best in the series and others saying it was the worst. I would classify this humor closest to Benny Hill."
38437,Bulldog Drummond Escapes,6.0,"Ray Milland brings loads of charisma and plucky British spirit to this 1930's tale of espionage and skullduggery. It's a fun, jolly effort as ""Bulldog Drummond"" attempts to get to the bottom of it all. Sir Guy Standing, Heather Angel and an on-form EE Clive complement this pacy little feature well and at just over the hour, we get plenty of action and quite a bit of humour too."
38467,The Scarlet Clue,6.0,"A fun outing for our sleuthing family; this time they try to thwart a cunning plan to sell secret government radar papers to the enemy. ""Charlie Chan"" is ably assisted by Mantan Morland and number three son ""Tommy"" (Benson Fong). There are barely half a dozen cast members, so the result is never in doubt, but this is quite a fast moving little detective mystery with enjoyable performances from all - including some quite funny stuff from Ben Carter."
38575,The Karate Kid,5.0,"A Karate kid which practices Kung Fu for a bad re-make.

Only Jackie Chan could be saved from this movie."
38575,The Karate Kid,2.0,I can not understand which was the purpose of this remake . A really bad choice . A movie which was 100 times worst than the original one . It was a waste of time for me . I am a huge karate kid fan but this one was one of the worst remakes i have ever seen .
38616,Marjoe,5.0,"It's a weird one. On the one hand it's an interesting insight into the shady world of evangelism and the mind of a man who doesn't believe what he's preaching. But the film doesn't really go anywhere or tell much of a story. It just seems like a lot of footage of Marjoe evangelising inter-cut with interviews, all of which ends rather abruptly without making any real point or coming to much of a conclusion."
38700,Bad Boys for Life,6.0,Not as good as the others. Martin Lawrence's character just didn't seem like he gave a 100% of his role in this movie. Kind of thrown off the chemistry they once had. It was still an ok movie.
38718,Reversal of Fortune,7.0,"Great performance from Jeremy Irons, well deserving of his Best Actor Academy Award, kind of is a letdown as both a legal and character drama. Some nice moments and solid performances from everyone but not sure I'll remember this one down the road. **3.5/5**"
38757,Tangled,8.0,"Tangled main characters really remember Aladdin's. The chameleon character could have been more juicy and it also repeats with stubborn determination Disney's intent of making any other animal to behave like dogs.

All in all, it is a stereotypical Disney movie that nails the template but it does it so well that it is also really entertaining. In addition, they get to add some of the fresh characteristics brought by Shrek to the scene."
38757,Tangled,10.0,"Might be my favorite Disney movie. My girls love it, and the hidden relationship metaphors are fun for adults to figure out."
38775,Night Tide,10.0,"A stunning, atmospheric, darkly beautiful film (noir). It's a Val Lewton-esque romance tinged with horror, set in a wonderfully spooky seaside town. It's a film about feeling alone, and then falling into anything, no matter how dangerous, that makes you feel like you're wanted. Curtis Harrington deserves to be a household name.

""<i>Because I feel the seawater in my veins. Because I listen to the roar of the sea and it speaks to me like a mother's voice. The tide pulls at my heart, and the face of the moon fills my soul with a strange longing.</i>"""
38842,Middle Men,7.0,Good story telling and cast. Nothing outstanding but a good time and laughs.
38985,Sorcerer,7.0,"**Spit on the floor, take off your warrior boots and crack open a can of lager.** This is the manliest film ever.
However, it is not just a banal acton movie, it has a gripping story and an intimate jungle atmosphere.
_7/10_"
39013,Winter's Bone,8.0,"Really good thriller/drama. Cast and direction are impressive, the script is round and the depicting of the surroundings is really genuine."
39053,Cyrus,4.0,"Decent premise but really slow pacing (especially in the first 1/3 of the film) and ultimately I felt that the execution of the idea was underwhelming. Weird way to turn it super drama-heavy for the last 10 minutes.

Kinda funny to have Reilly living in unit #13 tho."
39075,Madame X,8.0,"A fantastic story and excellent performance, given that this is an early (1929) talkie. Yes, the film suffers from the technical limitations of the time (audio, fixed lenses and single camera shots) as well as an acting style which is in the transition from silent to talkie, but these are fairly easy to overlook. Actually the sound is quite good. Many films suffered from clomping on every footstep, this one does not."
39130,Dinner at Eight,10.0,"Excellent. Part of my TCM Jean Harlow 4-pack, and the bonus feature-length doc on Harlow's short life and career is exemplary. Highly recommended to any Pre-Code connoisseurs--and I know you're out there..."
39222,The Kiss of the Vampire,7.0,"Simple if not entertaining horror-fantasy that doesn't have many standout scenes outside of the hilarious ending (seeing rubber bats on strings attacking people was amusing), but still had a fun time with it. **3.25/5**"
39245,"Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth",6.0,"The biography of a true legend. He was just becoming a star when he was killed. There will never be another Bruce Lee, and to this day there hasn't been."
39254,Real Steel,3.0,"I wonder if this was originally written to be a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots movie, but when they couldn't get the rights they just decided to make it anyway. In either case, it's not very good. Amazing that you could take a movie about anthropomorphic **robots** and manage to still make it into a cliche sports film. 

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
39259,Drácula,9.0,"Unfortunately because even film-lovers can be wusses and tend to stay away from subtitles, which takes some getting used to but can be a learned skill just like any other, this film has been horribly neglected. Thankfully it was included in the recent Universal Studios Dracula Franchise Collection--at least the DVD set I purchased. I must admit I like this basically as much as the Tod Browning-helmed, Bela Lugosi-starred, English-language original. Fine, underappreciated work by everyone involved."
39346,Casper: A Spirited Beginning,4.0,"<em>'Casper: A Spirited Beginning'</em> is rather rubbish, not that that is of any surprise.

It's a stripped back version of the original in every way possible, with the animation - which, admittedly, isn't the greatest in the 1995 release - particularly standing out as being awful. The cast are OK, if entirely forgettable - perhaps with the exceptions of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_McGill"" rel=""nofollow"">Chuck McGill</a>, Michael McKean, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Lion_King_(franchise)_characters#:~:text=and%20kill%20him.-,Mufasa,-%5Bedit%5D"" rel=""nofollow"">Mufasa</a>, James Earl Jones.

Let's see what <em>'Casper Meets Wendy'</em> cobbles together..."
39358,London River,7.0,"Good story about the drama after the terrorist attach in London.

Specially good Blethyn's performance and the prejudices of his character.

Kouyaté's presence could be hypnotic but I really failed on appreciating it.

The script could have had a better development during the search in London since it seems like they are looking everywhere but in the most obvious places: their own home and their working/studing places ..."
39413,My Afternoons with Margueritte,8.0,Simple and very well told story with a role made to the size of Depardieu
39428,The Neon Bible,5.0,"Geno Rowland did a great job here. Sadly, John Kennedy Toole is a much better writer than this movie would let on."
39434,The Stendhal Syndrome,8.0,"<I>Great works of art hold great power.</I>

I love this movie. The CGI scene we could do without but this was clever in story and main character.

This is quite rape issue heavily since dealing with a serial rapist in the movie and being raped. The twist and turn are so worth seeing developed and become what becomes an ending that I could see happen."
39486,Secretariat,7.0,"Quite decent story telling. Not too big pretensions and nice performance from a well chosen cast.

The story is quite stereotypical but it is well done."
39514,RED,9.0,"A great ride of a movie. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as Frank Moses and downplays his character like no one else could. Picture any other star in this role and it's a completely different movie. And where else are you going to see Helen Mirren dressed in an evening gown pumping out hundreds of rounds from a machine gun bigger than she is? Exquisite. Oh, and an honourable mention for John Malkovich. Just nuts!"
39514,RED,7.0,There old retired C.I.A. agents who are to be the best in the biz. Now the C.I.A. is after them and they will find out why.
39522,Mega Piranha,0.5,"OMG, You cant kill it with a Nuclear Bomb, but a U.S. Soldier with a knife. OMG the stupidity."
39522,Mega Piranha,1.0,"Okay, so right up until about five minutes from the end, my thought process was basically ""Yeah this sucks, but I mean, it doesn't deserve the **worst** rating. Maybe like, a full one star affair?"" but then that resolution came, and I realised how very wrong I was.

_Final rating:½ - So bad it’s offensive. I may never fully recover._"
39633,Operation Sex Siege,10.0,"One of the best erotic movies, I've ever seen. Excellent cast
10/10"
39857,The Untold Story,9.0,"A true exploitation CAT III classic.  Darkly humorous while also being incredibly disturbing at points.  Anthony Wong's performance is unhinged in the best way possible. While some of the special effects look like they were purchased from a party store, this isn't enough to hold this one back from being a classic."
39862,Crocodile 2: Death Swamp,3.0,"Even for **me**, that was too much swearing.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
39874,My Bloody Valentine,6.0,"Okay early 1980s slasher (with some decent gore effects, though the violence was very tame compared to today) that has its moments but really never found it very suspenseful or worse, engaging, maybe hurting there's not much in the way of a lead to follow. I know this holds a special place in some people's hearts, I just didn't do it for me. **3.0/5**"
39885,The Transgressor,7.0,One of the very best 'nunsploitation' films is full of provocative (and beautifully photographed) imagery.
39889,The Candy Snatchers,6.0,Odd little exploitation-esque crime-thriller that has its moments though acting is so-so and the mute boy angle was my least favorite. However the ending was starkly and surprisingly dark. Not great but certainly one worth checking out. **3.25/5**
39931,Mark of the Devil,7.0,"Surprisingly good and well acted drama featuring great performances from Herbert Lom, Udo Kier and Olivera Katarina. Some gruesome torture scenes isn't gratuitous and serves an actual story and characters. Seems like the sort of movie that Arrow would release and instead landed with Vinegar Syndrome, a distributor not exactly known for high quality works and more in the super low budge exploitation realm. Well worth checking out. **3.75/5**"
39946,The Browning Version,10.0,"In despicable literary characters such as Ebenezer Scrooge, and here, Michael Redgrave's Andrew Crocker-Harris, it is necessary--perhaps even more so now than ever before--to see the triumph of the human spirit and the soul-cleansing power of redemption and forgiveness (both in others and of ourselves).

This is the quintessential document of such a human transformation."
39961,The Land Before Time XIII: The Wisdom of Friends,3.0,"Holds the distinction of being the absolute worst of all 14 _Land Before Time_ movies.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
39973,Slave of the Cannibal God,6.0,"Not altogether bad but pretty disgusting scenes especially during the finale. However, Ursula Andress and Stacy Keach were good along with some great scenary filming in Sri Lanka. **2.75/5**"
39979,The Big Racket,8.0,"Some really disturbing scenes and real bastard villains kind gets undercut with some laughable slow-motion shots, especially at the end with paintballs hitting various characters. Still, a decent Italian crime-drama that kept my attention. **3.75/5**"
39991,A Blade in the Dark,5.0,"Well that was one unexpected twist. 
Though the slow pace made it almost not worth watching.

The effects were great but the story could've been shortened I feel but hey, this is a giallo movie after all.

This movie will be good for those really into this style of films.
I do enjoy the movie though. Just won't be watching it again anytime soon."
40016,Birdemic: Shock and Terror,1.0,"The worst movie I have seen in my life.

Everything is ridiculous. Terrible plot, laughable dialogs, awful acting, and less-than-amateur special effects.

**Don't ever waste your time watching it.**"
40072,Spetters,7.0,Paul Verhoeven supposedly played a character called Regie but fer the life of me I couldn't see him. Keep a look out.
40095,Dead Heat,7.0,"A bit goofy for sure but a fun horror-comedy, in the vein of Evil Dead 2. The performances from both Treat Williams and Joe Piscopo were fun. Think this is one with some good replay value. **3.5/5**"
40102,Don't Answer the Phone!,6.0,Flawed but entertaining (in a funny way when it comes to the killer) slasher from 1980. Nothing amazing but kept my attention until the end. No surprise this was the only film from the director. **3.0/5**
40141,Massacre Time,7.0,Serviceable spaghetti western features fine performances by Franco Nero and George Hilton. Doesn't really standout compared with others in the genre but still found it to be entertaining enough. **3.5/5**
40146,Night of the Demon,6.0,"This movie is pretty crazy with the story and the effects are decent.
A bit hard to believe this was considered a ""video nasty"" during its release but I guess some of the death are brutal there.

Definitely worth seeing this Bigfoot creature go murderous and then some in this film."
40147,Night of the Demons III,4.0,"Absolutely the low-point of the series. The cast doesn't seem to be having any fun, and the abandoned mortuary house in which basically the franchise is set is inexplicably changed out for some sort of a sterile display home, but it's still supposed to be the same joint? I dunno. Props for changing up the appearances of the possesed though.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
40164,Quiet Please!,7.0,"Poor old Spike just wants to take a nap and Jerry is taking full advantage of that fact by winding up Tom - safe in the knowledge that his burly mate is going to come to his rescue if Tom makes even the slightest of sounds... It takes all of the cat's dexterity and nimbleness to try and keep from waking his nemesis - will he succeed? A hammer, a custard pie, balloons-a-poppin', some knock-out drops and an huge stick of dynamite all feature! Great fun, this cartoon."
40218,The Beast Must Die,2.0,"the absolute worst werewolf ever put on screen, its basically a dog with extra hair glued on"
40229,The House on Sorority Row,6.0,"Has its moments I guess but nothing that really stands out other than a couple creepy shots. The performances are basic for this genre (though Akthryn McNeil was fine in the lead) while the kills are forgettable (just girls getting killed over and over using a cane). The twist also wasn't all that surprising either. Eh, it's fine however doubtful I'd ever revisit. **3.0/5**"
40342,Demons 2,4.0,"Anyone who was hoping for a follow-up to 1985's _Demons_ is gonna be sorely disappointed. What _Demons 2_ actually is, is Demons again, but in a different location. While they were busy repeating everything that the first movie did again, at least they remembered to copy the drug-taking punk kids in the car outside too, 'cause that was my favourite group in the first film, and now I get them twice. 

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
40481,"Snoopy's Getting Married, Charlie Brown",9.0,"This was great fun, as Snoopy does the even-more-human-than-dog thing of going through a sophisticated courtship, with hilariously all of the associated trials and tribulations that it holds for us people (including, unfortunately, the risk of being stood up at the altar, as our canine friend has happen here). Certainly not on a par with the vintage material of the classic era for the series, but for one of its 80's shows, definitely very enjoyable."
40594,Julia Sweeney - Letting Go of God,10.0,"Julia Sweeney is funny and very intelligent. Brought up Roman Catholic, she started having questions about religion after reading the bible. Whether you believe in God or not, her arguments and questions are insightful and provocative. She approaches the subject with an astute mind, looking into multiple religions and delving deeper than most people care to. Many people follow religion blindly, and accepting whatever they are told by their minister. You will follow Julia Sweeney as she attempts to reconcile her faith in God before ultimately, letting go."
40730,On Borrowed Time,9.0,"An old man fights to keep his orphaned grandson from being taken away by a scheming relative, and things get even more difficult when Death comes calling...in the form of the wry and gentlemanly Sir Cedric Hardwicke!  The film is well-done and packs a definite emotional wallop.  There is a very high standard of acting throughout, and the chemistry between Lionel Barrymore, as the crotchety grandfather, and Bobs Watson, as little Pud, is especially good.  Even when confined to a wheelchair, Barrymore's thespian talent still shines through.  

"
40797,The Trail Beyond,8.0,"One of Wayne's best B Films.  After a whole lot of creaky, bad B westerns, Wayne triumphs here. The locations are great, the stuntwork is great, and his teaming with Beery is great. Some of the editing of previous stuntwork into the climax is ridiculous, but this film works pretty well in a fun, old movie way."
40800,Alligator 2: The Mutation,5.0,"Not so much a sequel as a parallel almost-remake. _Alligator 2: The Mutation_ isn't as bad as I was expecting it to be, but given that I'd literally just watched the entire thing done better in every way only a few hours earlier in the first _Alligator_, it isn't exactly a success either.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
40807,50/50,6.0,Really good movie with drama and comedy. It's a raunchy sad love story pretty much. His best friend cracks me up.
40898,Summerfield,10.0,"In the spirit of Hitchcock's thrillers, Summerfield stands original and a cult monument to the great potential of Australian cinema. From the opening scene to close this film is flawless in its execution of a gritty and gripping story that will keep you thinking long after. The setting could not be more perfect, with wonderful use of the Aussie landscape, and both the acting and characterisation is engaging to say the least. A must-see gem of Australian film, and well-worthy of an international name."
40951,The Living Ghost,4.0,"There's something akin to Phil Silvers in James Dunn's performance in this Monogram thriller about a wealthy man who goes missing then returns to his armchair in some sort of trance. Ex-detective Dunn and his sidekick Joan Woodbury try to get to the bottom of it. It's engaging enough, but the quality of the script doesn't support the pacey dialogue anywhere near well enough; and the humour in the quipping dries up pretty quickly leaving us with a pretty routine caper."
40952,Alone in the Dark,8.0,"Simple but entertaining suspense-thriller with a fun cast that includes Jack Palance, Martin Landau and Donald Pleasence. The horror element was decent and acting pretty solid for the most part. The one minor twist in the finale I had an inkling about yet was still effective. Would make for a great viewing on Halloween night. **3.75/5**"
40983,Beware! The Blob,4.0,"Such a lacking and unfunny sequel to the original cult classic.

Not any of the supposed 'jokes' where funny and weren't distinguished as jokes like the original, the acting is also the worst acting I have ever seen and this is including Speed 2.

So overall, this film is one that I'm glad I didn't watch as a child when my love for the original was at its height, very bad and don't waste your time. 5/10."
41024,Condemned to Live,5.0,"Kindly old doctor ""Prof. Kristen"" (Ralph Morgan) finds himself amidst a spate of brutal murders - but it's only when he is told that his pregnant mother was bitten by a bat before he was born, that he considers that he might be the man responsible - especially as he has become prone to blackouts when it gets truly dark. It's a wee bit predictable, but there is enough to keep it interesting with a fun contribution from Mischa Auer as the hunchback and a better than average script that almost evokes a bit of sympathy for the beastie."
41077,Son of the White Mare,7.0,Needs a blu-ray release asap. Craziest animations I've seen - like chewing Bazooka Bubblegum but the flavor never runs out
41118,Scrooge,7.0,"Clearly, the story is the stuff of Christmas legend so there was no need to re-invent the wheel. Perhaps, also, because it was made in 1935 and Sir Seymour Hicks was already 64 when he portrayed ""Scrooge"" this film works well. It is both charming and poignant and uses the basic film techniques of the thirties - especially light and shadow - to convey some of the misery, menace and ultimately, joy of this Dickens story. Well worth an outing this (or any) Christmas."
41154,Men in Black 3,4.0,"Personal low point in the series to me. Brolin does do a commendable job of playing a young Tommy Lee Jones, but the script doesn't deliver. Not only is it not a very good one, it just offers the same story. **Again**. This is three Men in Black movies in a row where the A-plot is totally encapsulated by one sentence: ""Stop the creepy-crawly in a human suit from getting the jewelery."" There's a supporting role alien that was pretty endearing though.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
41216,Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,5.0,"I do not have anything even remotely resembling a clue about what I just watched, but like... Pretty cute. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
41245,Peppermint Candy,8.0,"Very well done and quite creative. Rather than create any spoilers, I'll just say that it's all revealed backwards."
41248,The Girl on the Train,5.0,"An interesting story, with tons of questions and few answers. Well told but nothing exceptional."
41272,The Puzzle,7.0,"Interesting movie about a house wife that discovers a new skill when she is already middle age and the changes that it would bring to her life.

Great performance by María Onetto and interesting story by Natalia Smirmoff."
41275,Python,8.0,"Love this movie. Sure a lot of it looks fake, but there's a lot of kills and good actors. I'd be scared of this gigantic python that's for sure."
41283,Faster,6.0,"I genuinely did not think I would like _Faster_ as much as I did. To be fair, I didn't think I would like it at all, but even so. This might actually be my favourite Dwayne Johnson role. It's almost entirely physical, which suits him very well, but the rare moments when it's not just that he nails too. 

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
41289,Bloodfight,4.0,"Not terribly well made, in fact the editing is at times atrociously jarring and the characters not developed all that great, with our main hero, Kai, early on takes on a street thug as a protégé before seeing, shocker, the guy was also an a-hole, beating up innocent civilians. Perplexing decision making. The film does give Bolo Yeung a bit more to do compared with Ironheart and there is one effective scene, in which he outright commits murder, but otherwise the martial arts fights are standard and the story could’ve use some tightening. **1.75/5**"
41345,Shank,6.0,"There's not a lot of love out there for _Shank_, but I for one quite enjoyed it. I understand it won't be for everyone, and I do come into it with a bit of a bias, but the only way you'll know for sure if you can appreciate _Shank_ (and decipher its various UK accents) is to watch it for yourself.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._"
41405,The Prime Ministers Sex Tape,8.0,"Sex scandal in a whole new level, courtesy of Private studios.
Fantastic sex scenes, and brilliant performance from the ladies - it goes to show that European women are hot!"
41436,Paranormal Activity 2,4.0,"More of the same as the first movie, found myself dozing off a couple of times. Only part I liked, in a funny sort of way, was the invisible demon pulling around the lead actress. **2.0/5**"
41436,Paranormal Activity 2,7.0,This is kind of like a meanwhile at her sisters place. Both of them have had haunting since they were kids. This could have been better as well. Not much happens for more then like half the movie. It makes it pretty boring till then.
41508,Fateless,7.0,"An interesting movie about the personal experience of a Hungarian Jew during the Holocaust.

Still, you cannot really empathize with the weird apathetic personality of the main character until the last reflections of the movie."
41574,Mosquito,4.0,"Guaranteed better than the same sort of thing released in the current era, but _Mosquito_ was still not a win in my eyes. The acting was abysmal and the creatures themselves were hit and miss.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
41733,Due Date,2.0,"A generic road trip movie with two terrible people who continuously make bad choices in a predictable plot rife with even more predictable ""gags"". Galifianakis portrays an even dumber and less funny version of the Hangover while Downey plays a less intelligent and less humorous version of Tony Stark.

Seriously, it isn't worth your time. If you want a funny road trip film then go watch 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' instead. Doesn't matter if you've seen it before. You will still feel a lot happier than if you had wasted your life on this film."
41768,Passion Fish,10.0,"I have watched Passion Fish many times and will certainly watch it again. It is one of those movies that seem practically perfect to me, from the lead performances of the ensemble cast down to the lesser characters, such as the numerous people who visit May_Alice and Chantelle during the course of the film. There are buckets a=of drama here that manages not to descend into melodrama (unlike the soap operas May-Alice used to act in), enough humor to leaven. The dramatic aspects, and personal growth that is realistic and helps us care more about the characters."
41796,The Adjuster,8.0,"It's a bit of a bizarre one, but I did really enjoy <em>'The Adjuster'</em>.

Words aplenty I do not have, it's just simply a very good film. The music is, in my opinion, its standout feature, as it sets the tone incredibly well - the sense of trepidation throughout is super. Elias Koteas is an excellent lead, though Arsinée Khanjian and Maury Chaykin perform just as strongly.

There's a lot to take in, but it is very much worthy of your time."
41805,V.I. Warshawski,1.0,"Well, kudos need to go to Kathleen Turner for actually trying. She makes it a bearable film by force of personality alone.

However none of the jokes really landed. The dialogue is horrible, the direction is flat and looks a lot like a single camera sitcom.

Basically, it's just Kathleen Turner trying her best to salvage a bad film with nothing really going for it. She brought her A-Game to it and that should be recognized, however it's not something worth watching, despite her best efforts."
42023,Heat,5.0,"Had a couple okay moments and Burt Reynolds's charisma made it watchable, but the plot was muddy and I just didn't think it was very entertaining, which was pretty much my opinion of Wild Card which was also based on William Goldman's novel. **2.5/5**"
42164,Camera Buff,7.0,"An early Kieslowski with all the trademarks that he refined later in life and that made him one of the greatest filmmakers ever: the politics, the moral dilemmas, the existential questions - that are, of course, not resolved. It's put together well, although his later greats are much tighter. While watching, I couldn't help but wonder how much of this is actually autobiographical."
42194,Tekken,5.0,"Boring watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.

I tried and fell asleep on this 3 times.  There is plenty of things happening, but who cares, really?

The movie goes far out of the way to disconnect the audience from the characters, world and action.

Maybe I'll update this if I can ever get through it, but I can't see it being better than what I think it is right now.

Unless you're just a big Tekken fan, go watch ""Dead or Alive"" instead."
42211,Killer Nun,4.0,"I'm not exactly steeped into the history of the 'nunsploitation' or anything, in fact this the first one I've ever seen, but I found this to be a disjointed film as many Italian films from the 70s tended to be, at least the many I've watched so far. Anika Ekberg actually wasn't half bad at least. **2.25/5**"
42218,Empire of the Ants,4.0,"The audio in _Empire of the Ants_ is infuriating to the point of being nigh unwatchable. But on mute? By jingo you might just be onto something there.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
42226,Coup de Grâce,9.0,"This really struck a personal, compelling blow for me. I completely understood von Trotta's performance of a person who will do anything, no matter how devastating to whom, in order to be noticed, and loved. This film should be much better known, and watched."
42234,Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands,8.0,"Two husbands are better than one. Still funny after all these years. This film, like Ofreu Negro, is permeated with the Afro-Brazilian spiritualism which is still present in much of Brazil. It helps to read the wikipedia articles first (because I had to stop the movie to learn who Ezu was): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macumba and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbanda."
42236,Fellini's Casanova,4.0,"Wasn't a big fan of 8½ when I saw that one over a decade ago, never watched another Fellini movie, until this one. While I do appreciate some of the visual aspects and some really bizarre scenes, not to mention a fine performance from Sutherland, found this to be tough to sit through. Far too long clocking in at 2.5 hours, it's a bit tedious and I chuckled at scenes that I don't think were meant to. This just was not my thing. **2.25/5**"
42241,Sebastiane,6.0,"There is something quite sensuous about this rather vulgar, raucous and unsubtle take on the martyrdom of St Sebastian. When there is any dialogue, it is in Latin which somehow adds to the mystery of the story. It's not anywhere near as graphic as you might expect, nor the sado-masechism as prevalent. It does border, frequently, on the comedic, though - perhaps not an effect Derek Jarman was seeking. Who plays whom in the film is academic, it is all about imagery and just about works at that."
42299,Busy Bodies,9.0,"While the plot's comparatively thin, this is a very enjoyable short film from the boys with some of the finest gags, and is thus essential viewing for comedic fans of all ages and of any filmic era."
42307,Road Train,4.0,Bad supernatural-esque horror film with annoying characters though some of the gore effects at least were okay and I guess conceptually had an interesting premise just done poorly. Good news it's only 90-minutes long. **2.25/5**
42469,The Creeping Flesh,8.0,"I love both the horror films of Britain's Hammer Studios and the pairings of Sir Peter Cushing and Sir Christopher Lee so very much. Though this is one of their latter and lesser-known, it doesn't disappoint. Very much worth purchasing and rewatches for the horror connoisseurs amongst you..."
42567,David and Bathsheba,8.0,"I have to admit that I greatly enjoy the swords-and-sandals genre, whether of Christianity or of other types. This was solidly directed by King and had strong performances by Peck, Hayward and Massey, and was greatly touching at the end when David discovers the overwhelming and incredible power of forgiveness, particularly he of himself. Heartily recommended--it deserved its five Oscar nominations, even though it wasn't much of a cinematic year, to be sure."
42576,Hercules and the Captive Women,5.0,"The title is false--there is only one captive woman. Also, I have never seen a so-called hero sleep so much in my life."
42620,The Girl from Rio,2.0,"This movie was more softcore porn than an actual movie and it was more long pointless camera shots than it was anything else. The characters are near pointless, the acting terrible, the story confusing - I really think this was just to show women in skimpy costumes. I barely got through it with the Rifftrax commentary which at least provided something entertaining in this weird film."
42628,"Goké, Body Snatcher from Hell",8.0,"The message was deep. Way better than it should have been. Alien vampires, war and destruction, resulting in the total destruction of Earth.  Dark and a bit campy, very enjoyable film that leaves you thinking. "
42633,No Way to Treat a Lady,7.0,"Rod Steiger's performance as a twisted serial strangler is the best thing about this tongue-in-cheek cat and mouse thriller from director Jack Smight. The laughs center mostly around detective Morris Brummel (George Segal) and his domineering mother (Eileen Heckart). Lee Remick is there mostly for something nice to look at, but see this for Steiger!"
42637,Diary of a Lost Girl,9.0,"Outrageously acted by Louise Brooks and directed by Pabst. One of his blue ribbon winners, to be sure."
42647,The Twelve Months,7.0,"A very nice film, different from the hundreds of films we are used to, in which kings and queens are always kind and nice people. This story is more realistic and suitable for children for sure. It deserves an english dubbed release, such as a lot of other films from the same period."
42676,The Fifth Cord,5.0,"Very average mystery-horror giallo film that at least stars Franco Nero who I liked here, but otherwise nothing all that good despite some nice cinematography. Not a complete waste of time but I lost interest by the end. **2.5/5**"
42683,Black Legion,8.0,"A really different film and role for Humphrey Bogart, as he gets passed over for promotion to a foreigner and decides to join a thinly-veiled (pardon the pun) cloaked organization to gain some vengeance. His acting is getting better and you can tell he's just a couple of roles away from superstardom."
42684,Skyline,3.0,"The ending could maybe have been engaging if it made sense, but even putting the best possible spin on _Skyline_, it still repeatedly commits the cardinal sin of the entertainment industry: Being boring.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
42852,"Goodbye, Mr. Chips",8.0,"What a gorgeous, gentle, film about the end of empire and of an era that showed a culture of respect and deference that has now long since vanished. Robert Donat always managed to portray the quintessential Englishman well - if, at times, in a little overly stilted fashion; and with Greer Garson's beautiful representation of a lady of the times this leaves us with a slightly warm feeling. Certainly, it doesn't not promote any equality amongst the sexes, but the ""Blue Danube"" scene has to be amongst the most romantic ever committed to film."
42870,Creatures from the Abyss,4.0,"The blue checker bikini was cute and sufficiently small, but the purple bikini with the built-in pink micro ruffled skirt was a...choice.  Kinda hot in a very 90's way.

Oh wait, there was a movie?

Subpar horror flick with boobs.  Badly dubbed into English.  Cheesy monsters in that 90's way that hasn't been long enough ago to become charming.  Acting was...not great, but that might have been the dub."
43014,Tower of London,8.0,"This was great--having Vincent Price do Richard III in the midst of his great run for Roger Corman. Well worth seeing--mine was on my blu Vincent Price Collection, Volume III."
43036,Mill of the Stone Women,7.0,Pretty weird Italian horror film that reminded me a bit of Frankenstein. Not great and I kind of lost interest halfway through but it does pick up in the finale and all in all found it to be entertaining enough. 3.5/5
43074,Ghostbusters,1.0,"This movie is horrible. It plays like an overly long SNL sketch. The only saving grace is that this lost so much money that there will not be a sequel. Unfortunately for the fans, this means that the franchise is likely dead in the water for a long time."
43074,Ghostbusters,1.0,This movie is a disaster. The casting is way off. The special effects are mediocre. The story is merely a retread from the original... and they shoot the original logo in the crotch. There is nothing good about this production. What a waste of a perfectly good franchise.
43074,Ghostbusters,3.0,"I didn't watch this for quite a while because I heard so many bad things about it. ""What do they know?"" I thought to myself. I figured _Ghostbusters_ had already had a bad sequel I sort of enjoyed, a bad remake should be sort of enjoyable too. Besides, you just **know** that so many of the complaints were exclusively because the cast had been of the dreaded ~~fEmaLe VeRsiOn~~ variety. But I just watched it, and... Oh man you guys, this really did suck. I'm devastated.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
43089,Roadgames,5.0,"Uneven suspense-thriller does feature a fine performance from Stacy Keach but otherwise pretty disappointing as I normally enjoy these sorts of thrillers. Also has characters making bizarre, though luckily ultimately correct choices... **2.75/5**"
43105,The Alligator People,5.0,"What seems to begin in the southern gothic vein, complete with voiceover narrative by a newlywed (likable Beverly Garland) concerning the sudden and mysterious disappearance of her husband, soon picks up the pace as a sci-fi monster picture, akin to previous year's <i> The Fly. </i> Unfortunately, the last act fully descends into tomfoolery and questionable monster makeup - namely a rubbery alligator suit. Despite its disappointing ending, the 1950s b/w cinematography is nice at times, but the film might have benefited with greater use of close-up shots to add a touch more melodrama to its undeniably laughable story."
43117,I Married a Monster from Outer Space,6.0,"'I Married A Monster From Outer Space' doesn't stray too far from the run-of-the-mill 50s sci-fi that has become a pop-culture cliché, but it does distinguish itself enough to almost be regarded a classic of the genre. Real thought has clearly gone into it, to offer audiences at the time something more substantial than the usual B-grade monster scares, and it's for this reason that, over sixty years later, it justifies still being in conversation.

43148,The Vampire Bat,5.0,"Lionel Atwill is quite menacing as ""Dr. von Niemann"" in this horror mystery. Folks from a very superstitious European village start dying - drained of all their blood; and vampirism is their logical conclusion. Melvyn Douglas has a much more sceptical head on his shoulders and decides to investigate further. This is better than the usual gothic mystery; and Fay Wray adds a little glamour to the proceedings too. There are no special effects to giggle at - and no music at all, just a couple of decent performances and an hour of quite an eerily told murder story."
43332,Demetrius and the Gladiators,8.0,"This was a solid and very satisfying sequel to 'The Robe' for me. I have both a soft spot for swords-and-sandals epics of days gone by, and a preferential fondness for films from cinema's studio glory days of the 20's to 60's--not to mention my enjoyment of earlier Daves' classics such as 'The Petrified Forest', 'Dark Passage' and 'Destination Tokyo'--so this was like a fine red wine for me."
43332,Demetrius and the Gladiators,2.0,"was about to rate it 3 for the tiger fight, but the end was too corny to handle"
43449,Romance on the High Seas,8.0,"Absolutely charming musical romance comedy featuring an amazing debut from Doris Day. A lot of fun and plenty of laughs, though today's audience, or least those around my age (35-40), this will remind you of a plot straight out of a sit-com with the mistaken identity aspect. Still, really entertaining. **3.75/5**"
43519,We Dive at Dawn,7.0,"A cracking wartime adventure about a submarine tasked with tracking down and destroying the new Nazi battleship ""Brandenburg"". The added authenticity of this being actually made during the war is hard to overstate; there is a palpable tension as Eric Portman and John Mills take centre stage in this - admittedly ""flag waving"" production. Featuring a daring raid on a fuel dump, a tense cat-and-mouse chase, and giving more than a nod to the concomitant problems faced by the families left behind ashore; this is a taut and convincing tale of underwater seamanship."
43539,The Next Three Days,8.0,"Seen this movie a handful of times over the years, and still holds up so well. A solid thriller with fine performances by Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks, and features a great supporting cast in small parts (seems about 5 min. each), including Liam Neeson, Daniel Stern (wish he'd do more straight dramas), Brian Dennehy (RIP) and Olivia Wilde. Some nice suspense-filled moments throughout (the bump key scene still gets me).

However, the final scene with detective ""seeing"" how the crime went down seemed like something the studio wanted to give a clear conclusion, and felt so unnecessary. **4.0/5**"
43610,The Valley of Decision,8.0,"Classic poor-girl-meets-rich-boy tearjerker.  This very heavy-handed drama is well-acted by Greer Garson and Gregory Peck, with Lionel Barrymore and Donald Crisp heading a good supporting cast.  The script is interesting, maybe a mite slowly paced at times, but with moments of humor as well.  The tense, dramatic confrontation on the bridge is the most memorable scene in the film.  This was only Gregory Peck's third film, having made his Hollywood debut a year earlier.

Would I recommend?  Yes, sure.  A good romance, with great actors.  What's not to like?"
43756,A Simple Curve,6.0,Beautiful scenery highlights this lightweight story about the relationship between father and son. A sugary feel-good movie for most of it's running time. Not one of Film Movement's better offerings. 3 / 5 stars for the cinematography.
43795,Penny Serenade,8.0,"This film boasts a wonderful dramatic turn by a young Cary Grant.  If you're of the minority who view Mr. Grant as a boring, overrated comedy actor, give this a watch because the great man can most certainly act!  It's a very enjoyable romance, elevated by a sparkling cast.  The story is very heartwarming, but also quite the tearjerker.  The record player transitions between scenes are quite a lovely touch, and good special effects for its time.  Good family viewing."
43828,Destry Rides Again,9.0,"This was very interesting and I enjoyed it significantly. It's weird watching very early James Stewart--he's not what one would consider a conventional romantic male lead--and this is a very bizarre Western/comedy/musical. Anything starring Dietrich of this vintage is priceless, no doubt. Very weird, especially considering America's ever-present right-to-bear-arms controversy, watching a film like this, too. A purely magical film that's essential to own and re-watch for any Stewart, Dietrich or Western enthusiasts--and a strong reason why 1939 was the greatest year ever for American cinema."
43832,Only Angels Have Wings,10.0,"Holy Smokes.

And they do smoke a lot in this film.

Geoff as the prototypical ""man's man"" who runs a struggling air freight company near a difficult to pass mountain. I don't want to give too much away, but between a handful of airplane crashes and a new beau and ex lover showing up there is a lot going on.

I can't remember the last time I teared up from pure joy from a film. But this movie has about a perfect an ending I've ever seen."
43841,Block-Heads,9.0,"This was a genuine treat, with all the craziness you'd expect involving a man who doesn't know a war's over for twenty years! Some of my very favourite set-pieces of theirs, including Laurel destroying Ollie-and-wife's car and kitchen, and Ollie incurring great personal trauma and inconvenience because he simply sees Stan sitting in a wheelchair on one of his legs and thinks he's a helpless cripple. Required viewing for fans of comedy or of cinema from the 30's."
43874,Camille,9.0,"Greta Garbo (I'm not objective in the slightest here, because she's my favourite actress ever) is astonishing as The Lady of the Camellias in this, the most well-known cinematic rendition of Alexandre Dumas' tragic story. In comparison to the 1921 silent version, Cukor's a much better director, though Rudolph Valentino's better as Armand Duval. Both versions are intriguingly different, and Henry Daniell's just great as the villainous Baron. Essential viewing, especially for fans of Garbo and classic tearjerker films."
43933,Monsters,6.0,"Story that is so down to earth in spite of talking about alien creatures that you think it could really happen ... only, it is not thrilling and gets boring at some point.
The two main characters, though, are very well played by McNairy and Able."
43939,I'm Still Here,4.0,"I do not really get the point of this movie.

It really looks to me like a big internal joke between Affleck and Phoenix that is extended in time by far too long.

I have to praise Phoenix's performance but the character itself is too laughable to be kept for that long.

Anyway, an interesting experiment but that could have been shown just in 15min."
44003,The Great Journey,5.0,"A voyage without energy.
I see many Film Movement releases and this is among the weakest I've seen. Listless. It failed at everything it tried, whether road,father/son or spiritual journey. The huge throngs at Mecca at the end were impressive but otherwise I can't recommend."
44012,"Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles",8.0,"Yes, it's 3 hours, but we have to forgive that it's from an era before MTV and the resulting cultural ADD. If I didn't know better, I'd think this was the inspiration for Aronofsky's Academy Award-winning film 'Black Swan (2010). Well, actually, I don't know better. Maybe it was. 

The premise is similar. Here we become the spectator of one woman's descent into madness. It's kind of riveting in a ghoulish sort or way."
44012,"Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles",10.0,"There's a lot of much deeper things to say about this film and what it does and what it means, about the crushing routine of everyday life, about the nature of the worlds we live in, the stories we tell, but for now I just wanna say this movie is incredibly hypnotic and genuinely engaging and passes by far quicker than any movie this long and with this little happening rightly should. Good stuff tbh."
44023,Make Mine Mink,8.0,"Make Mine Mink is a top quality comedy that should have you laughing throughout. Bored with their humdrum lives four London flatmates decided that they should turn modern day Robin Hoods when they get a buzz from returning a fur coat to a neighbour before their housekeeper can be implicated. With great performances from Terry Thomas, Hattie Jacques, Athene Seyler, Elspeth Duxbury and Billie Whitelaw this comedy farce from 1960 may have aged but is still a lot of fun!"
44037,Lake Placid 3,3.0,"We're back again to sully the kinda-okay name of _Lake Placid_!

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
44115,127 Hours,6.0,Franco provides a nice performance but the movie is not that hooking and Boyle repeats his visual techniques once and again.
44115,127 Hours,1.0,"It was the borring movie I ever watch.

And I will not recomend anyone go see this."
44115,127 Hours,8.0,watch it at like 11yo.. ngl I had some scoobie-doo nightmare for a while (iykyk) but I otherwise enjoyed the movie a lot ! was scarred it would be the same stuff over and over but the in depth flashbacks doesn't allow this
44129,The Company Men,7.0,"The story is quite flat and stereotypical. No ups and downs. Everything goes as expected and, of course, we have a hopeful positive ending for the needs of the US viewer.

The cast is impressive and direction, cut and performances are OK."
44214,Black Swan,10.0,"What a deliciously, decadent, dark piece of candy this film is! Natalie Portman is a revelation and the film is unpredictable but moves with an assurance to take you places you may not want to go. But you want to know how it all ends. Great film. I think most people won't appreciate it until a couple of years from now."
44379,The Gleaners and I,9.0,"One doesn't normally use the word ""fun"" and documentary in the same sentence, but Varga has such a unique personality and style that her films are actually fun. The Gleaners and I may be the most fun and yet, Varga delivers the political message with Vaseline. At the same time, we get an education on found art."
44468,Red Hot Riding Hood,9.0,A great and fun Tex Avery cartoon as he envisions a world in which the three main characters of the classic fairy tale are tired of doing the same old-same old and decide to try a way different approach. A fine extra on the blu of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' (1946 version).
44497,Hustler White,3.0,"I can see how this works in the context of the nihilistic and homophobic early 1990s but, outside of the grunge era, it's just obnoxious and lazy filmmaking. A few laughs can't save what is a well-conceived but poorly executed idea."
44545,The Werewolf,9.0,"Seen this at the movies in 1956!  This is my favorite werewolf by far.  I try to watch it a couple of times a year.  Takes place in the mountains in Big Bear, Calif.  Very fast pace, no guts & gore, Werewolf makeup man did a good job.  Couple of scary moments, the cave scene and the jail scene!  Watch it if you get a chance - You just may like it!! 
David N."
44564,The Dilemma,3.0,"**Just Cringe 😬**

Billed as a comedy but is entirely devoid of humor. Just uncomfortable from beginning to end. Vaughn and James seemed lost and confused most of the movie, unsure of whether to be funny or not."
44603,Hereafter,6.0,"Clearly, no the best movie directed by Eastwood.

The performances are quite OK but the story is flat from the beginning to the end."
44629,Animal Kingdom,8.0,"Terrific movie and terrific performances, specially Jacki Weaver's

Very well scripted and rolled."
44639,Inside Job,8.0,"A good and clean explanation of how US side of the 2008's global economic crisis was nurtured.

Really well cut and simply explained so everybody can understand it. Also, a good introduction to all the main characters with certain degree of responsibility in the US.

A pity that the POV from the very beginning is that the system was perverted and doesn't go forward. You would miss a critical analysis on whether the capitalist system works at all or systematically causes these problems because it is in its own nature."
44668,She Had to Say Yes,7.0,"An excellent pre-code era film that illustrates the pressure for women to use their sex to help their boss, but becoming a ""bad woman"" by doing so. In addition, it illustrates  that men are expected to  be promiscuous while women are expected to be virgins.

The greatest shortcoming of the film is imposed of the norms of the period: Loretta, like every woman, has to forgive any outrageous and even violent behaviour by a sexually aggressive male and to assume that it is really her fault."
44716,In a Better World,8.0,"Good script, good direction, good photography and good performances, specially from the children.

This story about bullying and problematic families would have everythiing if it wouldn't be because it is too obvious and predictable. Almost, manipulative.

I think I even liked it more because I'm starting to ""understand"" more and more the Scandinavian culture and its problems."
44725,One Piece: Chopper's Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals,6.0,"<blockquote><i><b>gomu gomu nooo</b></i></blockquote>This whole movie is just <i>freshman orientation </i>for Chopper,"
44775,Pack Up Your Troubles,9.0,"This was definitely one of the strangest comedies I have yet seen that focused on World War I, as a friend of the duo's dies and leaves his baby daughter in their care, with the hopes of re-acquainting her with his rich family. Trying to find them is of course no easy task, and leads to one comedy of errors after another. Another fine feature film that's gotten them in."
44796,Arena,10.0,"This cheesy underrared sci-fi film should be a staple of any 80's sci-fi fan. A guy with a humble background makes it to the big time. 
This is a great example of the type of film that used to fill the shelfs at your local videostore. Nothing super great just good clean fun."
44801,Real Men,10.0,"It's really stupid, but in a really good way.

The basic premise is a tough as nails CIA Agent has to take a man off the streets, one that is a dork, a beta male, and get him to stand in for a dead CIA agent. This we have seen over and over again.

What sets it apart, however, is the fact that Jim Belushi also has to boost up John Ritters confidence even as he's beating him up. It's amazingly hysterical.

And on top of that you have a healthy dose of stupid humor.

It's a can't lose."
44809,Dinocroc vs. Supergator,3.0,"I get it, David Carradine, I totally get it...

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
44891,Any Old Port!,9.0,"This film, like Buster Keaton's earlier 'Battling Butler', is great comedic fun and essential for lovers of boxing movies."
44892,The Music Box,10.0,"This is to me the finest Laurel and Hardy film ever made, not to mention one of the greatest comedies or movies ever made. Period."
44936,Don't Go in the Woods,2.0,"Really awful in every regard: acting, setting, pacing, intensity, horror/gore. Nothing. And at times, at least early, absolutely hilarious with the dialogue and bad dubbing work. I did watch this very late so I did get a little tired towards the end, but still this is quintessential good-bad territory. **1.0/5**"
44945,Trust,8.0,Chilling movie that was pretty uncomfortable to watch but features great performances from Clive Owen and the young Liana Liberato. This was a passion project from David Schwimmer who directed and wrote (uncredited). Swore I had seen this one before but didn't remember much of it until the very end. **4.25/5**
44950,A Horrible Way to Die,1.5,"This should have been called ""A Horrible Waste of Time"". A barely coherent attempt at layering multiple timelines, painfully slow to the point my eyes were rolling in my head at times as I tried to stay awake, and a weak twist delivered far too late in the day to be worthwhile waiting for."
45029,Fit to Kill,6.0,"Still terrible for sure but more consistent in the good-bad territory with fewer dull moments, plus the dialogue while still bad not quite as stilted compared with Hard Hunted, and I did manage to chuckle at the ridiculousness of it all. **3.0/5**"
45030,Hard Hunted,5.0,"ind of similar to the others in the series, some funny bad moments for sure, including the cheesy-looking gyrocopter and awkwardly placed mild sex scenes, and nudity, along with terrible dialogue and acting, with  too much dull spots to make it all that entertaining. **2.75/5**"
45054,There Be Dragons,3.0,"Story about Opus Dei's founder which advocates about his work through a much incoherent parallel story of the crimes committed during the Spanish Civil War and the today's stormy relationship of a son and his father.

Most of the performing is pretty bad, maybe also empowered by the clear difficulties that many of the Spanish actors have to do so in English and their strong accent when speaking."
45103,Richard Pryor: Live and Smokin',2.0,"I'm a fan of Pryor's live work. However after seeing this I'm not so sure it should have ever been released. I suppose it shows that comedians can have an 'off' night and that was certainly the case. Maybe it was the camera's, maybe a small crowd to feed off. From what I guessed, I'm sure the crowd didn't know what was going on. Not really funny and it seems like a berate the audience show (probably like the national gay association gig). Personally it wouldn't have bothered me to skip it."
45132,Super,1.0,"Terrible, disturbing movie. Felt sick watching it. I would never reccomend this movie. there are so many better vigilante movies in existence throughout all of years: past present future. i regret watching it."
45147,Strictly Business,4.0,"It's kind of like _'MO MONEY'_. But without the jokes. And the crime backdrop. So what we're left with without these elements is a rather empty shell of a film.

Usually a big big fan of African American comedies of the 90's but yeah this was no winner.

Bitching soundtrack though."
45162,Superman/Batman: Apocalypse,5.0,"Pretty weird decision to make a movie with a female character in the lead, stock it chock full of female supporting roles, then title it ""_Superman/Batman_"", but okay. Guess I should just be glad it got made at all, especially way back in 2010. The film itself? It's alright, has that bizarre simplistic-yet-confusing combo that you'd think is such an oxymoron it'd be impossible to hit but superhero fare pretty frequently stumbles in to, but at least it's not **completely** paint by numbers.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
45169,Quintet,10.0,"They, the players, make a mistake, bend one their rules, and they pay."
45269,The King's Speech,9.0,"Round movie: good story, great cast, impressive stage and fantastic performances. It has it all."
45317,The Fighter,8.0,"A really good movie like you don't easily find lately.

Great story, without getting into getting cheesy and great cat. Specially remarkable Christian Bale and Amy Adams but they all perform superb.

Just waiting for the second part ..."
45322,She-Wolf of London,5.0,"A meandering tale of an heiress who begins to believe that she is a werewolf prone to escaping from her plush London home at night and savagely killing people. It could just be an early example of a serial killer because we see scant evidence of a she-wolf; indeed there are no special effects employed at all in this very low budget horror film. Sara Haden has something of the ""Danvers"" about her as the aunt and Dennis Hoey once again does the business as the police inspector. It's worth watching, but all rather silly."
45324,Casino Jack,9.5,"""The great American past-time has never been baseball, it has always been making money.""  A true enough quote from the film, but the unanswered question remains:  ""Is fraud the 'dirty-little-secret-ingredient' necessary for capitalism to work?""

The most blatant fraud against justice is the ""non-disclosure agreement"" sold to criminals, by our justice system, to protect their trade-secrets.  Jack Abramoff's story was an unheeded warning, quickly forgotten; it isn't fraud if it isn't noticed."
45379,Chinese Odyssey 2002,8.0,"A thoroughly charming combination of romantic comedy and a parody of the films of producer Wong Kar Wai.

Faye Wong is just luminous and Tony Leung Chiu Wai shows he has significant comedic chops."
45413,Anna in Kungfu-land,10.0,"Funny as hell movie from one of the best directors working in Hong Kong today. With a clever screenplay, the cast is awesome. Lots of kung fu fun and some serious kick-ass from martial arts director Stephen Tung Wai. Highly recommended!"
45442,Treasure Hunt,6.0,"A muddled mish-mash of genres saved by charming performances by Chow Yun-Fat, Lau Kar Fai and the luminous Jacklyn Wu.

Also features the beautiful Yanni track 'Reflections of Passion' during its finale."
45650,The Hole,6.0,"Entertaining but not too scary and getting most of the inspiration borrowed from other movies.

Best is Chis Massoglia and Haley Bennett as main characters"
45772,Gnomeo & Juliet,6.0,"Really clever movie. Also very funny. I was quite impressed with this movie. I must say though if these things came to life for real, I would freak out!"
45927,A Haunting in Georgia,5.0,"This is not a movie. It's a TV show. I thought it was a movie. Anyway it's suppose to be a true story of a haunting in Georgia, of a little girl who can apparently talk to dead people like the sixth sense. Yea it's a good story, but without any proof it's hard to believe."
46026,Our Relations,9.0,"Highly enjoyable, and shows Laurel and Hardy's strengths as actors, as you see the infinitesimal differences the two put into each of their 'good' and 'bad' twin-brother performances. Recommended, especially to fans of the duo or of older comedic films in general."
46138,Made in Dagenham,7.0,"In spite of being an interesting story and having good cast and performances, it is not as thrilling as it could have been."
46146,Troll Hunter,7.0,Interesting and decent movie getting the most of what it has at hand for a probably quite low budget.
46175,Daughters of Darkness,6.0,"Well directed I suppose but the plot felt a bit jumbled at times, has just enough bizarre moments to keep me interested but can't say it's good, but still worth checking out. **3.0/5**"
46223,Dangerous Davies: The Last Detective,5.0,"Accident-prone cop Cribbins is assigned to find a long-time criminal thought to have returned to the neighborhood. His investigations lead him to looking into a disappearance of a teenage girl 15 years before that has never properly pursued. He uncovers the true story, despite being beaten repeatedly by a host of hoodlums. Detailed story offers funnyman Cribbins a rare and mostly straight leading role. Lipman scores as a frisky local lass. This was just about the last directing job for veteran Val Guest and has a solid cast of British character actors."
46260,Saps at Sea,9.0,"I vaguely remember first seeing this forty years ago with my parents, when I was very young--especially the set-piece in which they're trying to outwit the murderous escaped criminal on their boat by making a quite inedible meal. Still quite funny two generations later."
46330,The Phantom of the Opera,7.0,"Entertaining rendition with nice performances from Herbert Lom and to some extent Heather Sears, plus seeing Michael Gough playing such a scoundrel was new to me as only really knew him as Alfred... The music is fine and all in all, was a solid film, nothing terribly memorable however. **3.5/5**"
46330,The Phantom of the Opera,6.0,"This Hammer adaptation of the Gaston Leroux standard is much less a horror film; more just a story about love and betrayal. Aside from Michael Gough as the devious and loathsome ""Lord Ambrose d'Arcy"" the casting isn't up to very much, even Herbert Lom doesn't really seem to get into the swing of it. What is does have to distinguish it from other versions is it's own score to ""Joan of Arc"" and some lovely arias from Patricia Clark. The ending is rather better, too."
46528,The Warrior's Way,4.0,"This is really a bad movie. I've not seen anything this bad since Wild Wild West.

I don't really know what Geoffrey Rush was doing here ..."
46565,Black Turin,6.0,"I would have loved to see Bud Spencer in serious and dramatic roles like the one in Torino Nera.

It’s not a film that stands out significantly from the multitude of crime films released in Italy during that period, but it still manages to entertain, and  it does that nicely. despite the writing not being high quality in some parts, especially with the character of Rosario.

I can't find the soundtrack. Anywhere. I must admit that I occasionally rewatch the film just to listen to it again."
46643,Erotique,4.0,Got this for free. Had no idea what it was. Watched it and it's a 4 short series films of soft core porn. I wasn't impressed.
46731,The Midnight Patrol,9.0,Laurel and Hardy have to be the worst--and shortest-lived--policemen ever on celluloid. An excellent short film of theirs.
46738,Incendies,10.0,"Great movie for a great and tough story.

Good photography and cut, the story is well developed and the performances are superb.

Also, it doesn't fail on being over dramatic. Just the perfect balance.

A must to be seen."
46959,Dial Code Santa Claus,7.0,"Fun killer Santa Claus horror-thriller that took a bit to get going (found the first 35-minutes to be a bit dull), but after that some truly suspense-filled scenes and hilarious moments with the kid going all out on Claus. A mish-mash of Home Alone meets Rambo with a little John Wick thrown in. **3.5/5**"
46979,Le Amiche,8.0,"This film is taken from one of Cesare Pavese's finest works. It's seen through the eyes of Clelia, a fashion designer who has left her native Rome to start a business in Turin. There she witnesses a suicide attempt by Rosetta, a woman whose life, and the lives of Momina and Nene will influence Clelia's greatly. Marriage, men and money are the chief elements of the plot. This is one of Antonioni's finest films, from the period before L'avventura when he was exploring the themes that would preoccupy him for his entire career."
46993,Madame Satã,4.0,"Honestly, it's unwatchable. Didn't see any real merit other than it was a cheap excuse for gay porn."
47126,Windy City Heat,8.0,"Pretty damn funny. There is a lot of people who question it's authenticity, but real or not, it's pretty funny. Bobcat turned out to be a pretty inventive writer/director, or whatever it is he does."
47340,Dead End Drive-In,6.0,"Starts by ticking you into thinking it's going to be one of the 47 million _Mad Max_ rip offs that was released around the same time, but quickly takes a left turn into ""poignant social commentary"". Keeps the punks though, so that's cool.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._"
47460,Daffy - The Commando,7.0,"A Nazi commander and his diminutive soldier ""Schultz"" are charged with protecting their spot on the line from encroaching commandos. ""Daffy"" is sent on just such an Allied mission and swiftly proceeds to make light work of their defences as he causes a bit of propagandist mayhem amongst his new, gullible, hosts before facing an whole mess of Messerschmidts! The wartime feel good message is clear as a bell, but it's delivered in a much more light-hearted, less jingoistic fashion and that's much more entertaining than many featuring this frenetic, non-stop, duck."
47582,Castle of Purity,8.0,"This is quite a brilliant fictional recreation of a true story that took place in the 50s. A man keeps his family locked in their house to protect the purity of his wife and 3 children. It's like watching a train wreck in very slow motion. For modern reference, it's somewhere between Black Swan and Dogtooth, although it predates both of those."
47837,The Fugitive Kind,6.0,"<em>'The Fugitive Kind'</em> is just a bit too slow for me, I almost did enjoy it mind you. Marlon Brando and Anna Magnani are the stars and I did buy into their relationship by the conclusion; which, by the way, goes from 0 to 60 real quick! It is a solid ending though.

What precedes just meanders a little too much, for my liking at least. There were periods where I was locked on to events onscreen, though the down moments were quite noticeable too, unfortunately, and when all is said and done the latter probably outweighs the former."
47931,Elite Squad: The Enemy Within,7.0,"This second part has a better plot than the previous one but, other than that, more violence without much sense."
47945,Daybreak,3.0,"**One of Cuba Gooding Jr's worst films, and I've seen most of them.** 

Dumb (and dull) plot, subpar acting (Cuba raises the bar slightly but his characters kind of comes and goes) other talents like Jon Seda and Omar Epps are wasted."
47957,Madman,5.0,"Saw this a while back and gave it a second shot with Vinegar Syndrome's 4K release and... my opinion remains the same. The kills are unspectacular and on the whole was pretty dull, as were the cardboard cutout characters. Not sure the timeline when it was filmed, but seems like a clear Friday the 13th clone. **2.25/5**"
48202,Creature from the Haunted Sea,5.0,"A decent early film by Corman, as he starts to learn his craft. Not an essential film by any stretch of the imagination, but worth a watch, either if you are an enthusiast of his works or of sci-fi from that era. Not worth purchasing--save your money for more important ventures, especially since you can watch it for free--and legally--at Internet Archive."
48259,Crimes of the Heart,8.0,"I haven't seen any Bruce Beresford films, except for the magnificent 'Black Robe', and I'm a huge fan of the four main actors, so it was a no-brainer that I would eventually watch this. I enjoyed it greatly, and if you can handle a quieter 80's women's picture, there's much to enjoy here. Definitely worth investigating for the cinephile with exquisite taste."
48303,Certified Copy,8.0,"Sweet movie about the living troubles of a 15 years long couple.

Juliette Binoche and William Shimell do a great performance."
48354,Lady in the Death House,5.0,"Lionel Atwill makes for quite a charismatic criminologist as he keeps this blackmail thriller moving along swiftly. He begins investigating the murder of a man so he can prevent the execution of a woman on death row, whom he believes has been wrongly convicted. To make matters worse, her fiancé is the executioner tasked with despatching her. The score is completely at odds with the pace of the film, but otherwise it's a suspenseful hour of drama. Just about worth watching."
48374,Piranha,5.0,"It's tough to commend any actual parts of the '95 remake of Piranha, but it's actually quite fun to group watch purely because it's so dated.

Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole."
48393,Kidnapped,7.0,"I thrilling and realistic movie that gets harder and harder to take.

Too unnecessarily violent at the end but hooking nonetheless."
48506,The Big Story,7.0,"They have even managed to include the dimple on his chin as this brief film shows us three iterations of an instantly recognisable Kirk Douglas bemoaning to his newspaper editor the fact that he never gets anywhere near the big stories. The editor (also him) irately tells him to wait his turn just as one of the more experiences journalists (him) turns up with the Marciano story he wanted to do! Frustrated, again. It's a simple but active pencil-drawn animation that I quite enjoyed as it captured his room pacing, facial expressions and general demeanour quite accurately."
48605,Conflict,6.0,"Interesting idea, but it wasn't done as well as it could have been. The inciting incident doesn't really make sense, and it's not clear what's happening during a lot of the action in the middle."
48650,Room in Rome,5.0,"Probably the worst movie I've watched from Julio Medem.

Room in Rome doesn't have such a powerful story. In spite of Medem's efforts in the script, it feels awkwardly artificial. The movie cutting is not good and the repetition of the same music is tiresome. Horrible, too, the opera singing dub lip done by Enrico Lo Verso. Not his fault but Medem's though.

Also, by far, the worst performance I've watched from Elena Anaya. Natasha Yarovenko is, probably, the only thing to save in this movie."
48670,The Chimp,9.0,"This was a very enjoyable romp in which Laurel and Hardy drive a circus into bankruptcy, are paid a flea circus and a chimp instead of their wages, and are endangered by a jealous hotel owner who just happens to get their chimp confused with his errant wife of the same name. Essential comedy from the 30's."
48671,County Hospital,9.0,"An excellent short film by Laurel and Hardy in which Stan visits Ollie, who happens to have a broken leg, and ends up destroying the hospital in the process. Clearly in the boys' peak period. A plus is Billy Gilbert, who was always one of their best villains, and a minus is obvious back projection, due to producer Hal Roach's financial instability at the time."
48755,Beau Hunks,9.0,This was hilarious--especially if you're a Jean Harlow fan. A really fun film for those of you who enjoy the comedic duo.
48756,Come Clean,9.0,"I honestly never thought a simple trip to the store to get ice cream could prove so chaotic, but this IS Laurel and Hardy we're talking about here, so anything is possible and very truly ensues."
48817,The Fixer Uppers,9.0,"One of the duo's last short films is another to cherish, as they portray greeting-card salesmen who are only too successful at helping a neglected wife get more attention from her husband by making him jealous. Some really fine work by the boys here."
48827,The Live Ghost,9.0,"Another fine short from the boys at their peak, this time stuck between a rock and a hard place, trying their best to avoid both an awful boss and a vindictive crew that they tricked into becoming fellow sailors. A fine supporting crew make this required viewing for comedy buffs of the period."
48830,Me and My Pal,9.0,"This was a hoot, as Ollie ends up late for his wedding because of a thoughtful gift from his best man, Stan--a jigsaw puzzle that EVERYONE becomes addicted to.

I'm especially fond of this film, and gave bonus marks to it, due to the fact that its release date was exactly 70 years before the birth of my son, Julian."
48871,Red: Werewolf Hunter,3.0,"Perhaps the avid Felicia Day fan might want to watch just for the ability to say that they watched a movie with Felicia Day in it. Otherwise it's pretty hard to see any value in this (definitely made for TV) movie.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._"
48890,Oliver the Eighth,9.0,"This was hilarious. It makes you understand, in an instant, why children reflexively scream when they're taken to get their hair cut for the first time, as well as why all the really smart people, like Pink Floyd in their heyday, always grew their hair so long. As well, it should make all prospective parents think twice before naming their sons Oliver."
48902,On the Wrong Trek,8.0,"Though predictable, this Charley Chase-featured comedy short, a bonus on my Laurel and Hardy boxed set (as it has a cameo of them), was a load of laughs. That'll teach Charley not to give them a lift!"
49008,Going Bye-Bye!,9.0,"This was pretty uproarious, as Laurel and Hardy have vengeance against them for sending a criminal up the river, then having the bad luck of bumping into his girlfriend on their way out of town. A fun short film from their peak period."
49009,The Way Back,7.0,"It is always a pleasure to watch one of Ed Harris movies.

The plot hooks you and the staging is impressive but the movie is not as thrilling as it could have been."
49013,Cars 2,4.0,"Lasseter is smart enough to tell us a completely different story than in the first movie. However, it is far from other titles like ""Toy Story"" or ""The Incredibles""."
49013,Cars 2,7.0,Not as God as the 1st just slightly though. I do think it's funnier then the 1st one. Diego just bothered the hell out of me for some reason.
49017,Dracula Untold,5.0,"FX, Evans and Dance's performances are the only things to save in this movie.

If you think Dracula becoming a hero and a martyr is a good idea, you will like it. Otherwise, like in my case, you will think that it was the worst idea in quite some time.

So, Dracula is not the most evil creature in the world any more ... :("
49018,Insidious,7.0,"It's not wholly original, but it works because the people involved **make** it work, first and foremost, James Wan.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
49026,The Dark Knight Rises,9.5,"The Dark Knight Rises is one of the best movies to come out in 2012. The story compels you to watch it time and time again. It also has I of, I my opinion, the best bad guys in any movie, Bane! Batman was well played as all ways and the cast where well selected. I think this movie is the best batman to see the light of day or the darkest nights (pun intended)."
49026,The Dark Knight Rises,9.0,"Even though the plot feels messier than the previous two installments, one cannot resist a smile after the unexpected twist and final scenes, which make ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ a worthy final chapter of Nolan's epical trilogy.

9/10"
49026,The Dark Knight Rises,8.0,I enjoyed watching the Dark Knight. They were at least able to keep the same batman from the the last one made too.
49040,The Bourne Legacy,10.0,Arguably the best Bourne film to-date. The acting is top-notch and the plot is just awesome and believable. It starts out a little slower than the previous ones but then it picks up. I can't wait for the next one! Woohoo!
49046,All Quiet on the Western Front,9.0,"All Quiet on the Western Front is as beautiful and poetic as it is brutal and blunt. Historically accurate, emotional, and raw, this film is easily the best war drama to arrive since ""Saving Private Ryan"". Although available in English over dub, watching the film in the native German language with English subtitles is the way to go. Somehow, hearing German commanding officers shouting in English doesn't have the same dramatic effect. The cinematography is amazing. Go watch it."
49047,Gravity,9.0,"Great story, great cast and performances, great direction, FX, photography, care for the details, OST and editing.

Alfonso Cuarón is a real titan and Sandra Bullock goes for the Oscar.

It is not a 10 because at some point the chain of events goes further that it should."
49047,Gravity,9.0,"**A cinematography masterclass!**

The cinematography of this movie is a breathtaking feat, unlike anything I have ever seen! The commitment to realism influenced every decision throwing the audience into the intensity of every moment. An enthralling ride from beginning to end with overwhelming effects and masterful storytelling that makes you feel every second. This movie absolutely earned its place on the list of “1001 Movies to See Before You Die.”"
49047,Gravity,8.0,"Gravity is an epic thrill ride that starts and never ends. I have not felt continued tension like this film in some time. The entire movie is so isolated and desperate, it is incredibly immersive. It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The script is a bit rough at times, a large portion of the dialogue does not seem realistic and can come off as corny sometimes, especially with George Clooney's character. Overall, it is short, face paced, and thrilling and I would highly recommend.

Score: 82%
Verdict: Great"
49049,Dredd,9.0,"This film blow me away! I was not expecting this, a cop (a judge) based in the future with high violent's and great characters. You will think you will hate Dredd but you wont."
49049,Dredd,4.0,"So, nothing new under the sun. The same boring story and characters mixed in another movie. The only thing remarkable in this movie is the slow motion used during the drug usage, which is not much to say."
49051,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,9.0,"An other great master peace has been added the the Lord of The Rings collection. This movie was an excellent example of how great actors, an amazing story and a beautiful world can be produced in such an excellent way. Peter Jackson has out done his self by creating this great film. There are differences from the book but I can't complain about any of them, yes I love the original story but this one is still one of the best. All in all a amazing movie."
49087,Moss,7.0,"You really can't beat the Koreans for unraveling a mysterious crime bit by bit, in the style of a dripping water torture. Sure, they could've done this movie with 40% less film, but it's still eminently watchable and enjoyable."
49114,$30,8.0,"Teenage Scott (Erik MacArthur) is presented with thirty dollar teen prostitute Emily (Sara Gilbert) on his birthday, and she figures out why he is not interested in her. The final film is also a good effort, with MacArthur and Gilbert scoring major indie film points, and they have a really nice chemistry. Emily's character is not delved into much, because this is not her story. Cooke's direction is fine, if not a bit awkward here and there, and Christopher Landon's script is smart- watch for the inside joke concerning Emily's choice of TV viewing habits. A solid entry."
49118,Majorettes in Space,8.0,"From France, this mockumentary ties in one heterosexual couple, one gay man, the production of condoms, the Pope, and the obvious fact that when a Cosmonaut calls his wife a ""fat cow,"" he is using a metaphor. This is a very fast and freaky collection of images, and it not only works, but makes some kind of sense. Fourier is making a statement about AIDS and protecting oneself sexually, but he does not take his point and belabor it."
49158,Tentacles,3.0,Yawn-enducing Jaws rip-off that is so dull with card-board characters with actors who could not car less and clearly there for a quick paycheck. This is one of those creature features that could've been the so bad it's good variety but instead is forgettable. **1.75/5**
49396,The Haunted,8.0,"OMG, I remember watching this movie around the time of it's release. I had nightmares for weeks after. Perhaps now showing its age a little, but overall a good story, and made all the more terrifying as it is based on a true story. 
It is so hard to find a Truly good Horror movie and in my opinion, this doesn't dissapoint."
49397,Death Rides a Horse,9.0,"This was excellent. My son's 13th birthday, and I treated myself afterwards to a really fun and engaging Spaghetti Western."
49444,Kung Fu Panda 2,7.0,"Threre are few sequels that are better than the original. This is one of them.

Smarter, with good plot and an amazing animation. Perfect for a movie session with the family."
49502,So Evil My Love,7.0,"Pretty good gothic thriller with everything from deceit, blackmail and ultimately murder. Liked the two leads with Ray Milland and Ann Todd, the latter's character being manipulated from innocent widow to a woman committing ever escalating crimes. Pretty tense film from beginning to end. **3.75/5**"
49519,The Croods,10.0,"Love this movie. I find myself coming back to this one over and over. Great animation, cool creatures, fun story."
49521,Man of Steel,9.0,"When I first saw the trailer, I was a little excited.

Man of Steel is the first of many films of what would now be known as DCEU. 

Zack Snyder did a really brilliant job directing this movie - it was amazing! Henry Cavill was superb as Superman and Michael Shannon was brilliant as Zod. And a hat tip to Russell Crowe's performance.

The best superhero film in 2013."
49521,Man of Steel,8.0,"Reading other reviews, I can understand how people that grew up with the comics didn't like it.  I never grew up with the comics.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It gets a lot of hate.  I thought the story, pacing, acting, and special effects were all excellent.  The scene where he learns to fly is one of the greatest scenes in modern cinema, in my opinion.  Gives me goosebumps every time."
49524,R.I.P.D.,6.0,"Yes, ok, it's a terrible film, but in the best way. It's worth watching just to see Jeff Bridges having so much fun sending up his character and himself."
49529,John Carter,8.0,"Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote his series of John Carter novels before space flight was more than a fancy.  This movie is more adventure and romance and very little (if any) actual science.

This movie is the best production of A Princess of Mars, the first story in the series, that I've seen.

If you're a fan of the John Carter novels then you will probably get some enjoyment from John Carter.  While there are some differences you'll meet some familiar characters and recognize quite a few relevant plot points.

Not a great film, but not a bad one, either."
49530,In Time,9.0,"Fantasy of course, but the way technology is changing the face of this world, in 2021 it would not surprise me. Action packed from start to finish, with many 'on the edge of your seat' moments. Worth my time and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for roller coaster entertainment.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
49530,In Time,10.0,Another one of my favorite movies. I've never seen a movie like this before. Imagine if you really did have a clock that tells you when your going to die.
49538,X-Men: First Class,9.0,"A very good movie!
I'm not a massive comic book reader/fan and when I watched the first couple of the X-men movies I always wondered how it all begin and this movie do it justice! The actors where great (there no Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellen), Kevin Bacon played the baddie very well and was well suited for it and it was graphically impressive.
Loved to see the development of the characters over the duration of the film.
In all, I think it was a excellent movie."
49730,Red Riding Hood,6.0,"Hardwicke clones Twilight style on every way in this movie: photography, editing, dialogues, disconnected story telling and even the looks of the male hero.

However, the script is interesting and keeps you hooked on not knowing what's going on until the end."
49786,Shadows on the Stairs,6.0,"For anyone who watches the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce ""Sherlock Holmes"" series of films, you will recognise almost all of the cast from this afternoon feature about guests in a boarding house who find themselves amidst a set of curious murders. It's all run-of the mill stuff but a decent enough adaptation of Frank Vosper's (himself, quite an interesting figure) play ""Murder on the Second Floor""."
49787,The Reef,6.0,"I can't say that The Reef is a perfect, realistic shark movie but it comes very close. It is also the first one I have seen so far where humans are bare in the water and not supported by a boat (Jaws (1975)) or a cage (47 Meters Down (2017)), for instance. It keeps the suspense throughout, making you guess a shark entry here or a panic attack there. Decent performances by the cast and a swift screenplay, The Reef will make for a good late-night watch with the family. (Grade B-). TN."
49841,Sarah's Choice,10.0,Abortion is one of the worst crimes against humanity that anyone can ever commit. This movie is an excellent resource for anyone still on the fence about whether the taking of a helpless fetus is the right or wrong thing to do.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
49849,Cowboys & Aliens,5.0,"This is an interesting concept, unfortunately it's already been done. And there are so many tropes in this it's hard to appreciate anything... except for Olivia Wilde and Sam Rockwell. They can stay."
49983,Enemy Gold,5.0,"Kind of by-the-numbers film from Andy Sidaris (though he only produced, son Drew directed) using much of the same cast and locales. A few good-bad moments and Julie Strain is beautiful (horrible acting even by Sidaris standards, however), but nothing really stands out. **2.5/5**"
50014,The Help,9.0,"Great setting, cast, story and performances. A must to be seen."
50053,2010: Moby Dick,2.0,"This movie was so bad, it's worth watching it at least once..."
50108,Sars Wars: Bangkok Zombie Crisis,7.0,"It is just as goofy as one would expect a Thai-indie self-aware zombie spoof comedy to be. If you want serious acting and a solid storyline - go watch something else. If you want a laugh involving zombie babies, a CGI snake, and absurd situations - then this may be what you are looking for. :-)"
50117,We Were Strangers,8.0,"It was unique to come across this early Huston work. It's weird that today, three generations later, when Scarlett Johansson gets in trouble for being cast as an Asian, that this was long the practice. I've seen star Jennifer Jones here as a Cuban, and later in 'love is a Many-Splendored Thing' as Eurasian.

She and John Garfield (himself playing a Cuban-born American businessman and revolutionary supporter) had good chemistry, and the film was finely made. Worth purchasing and rewatching."
50124,Frivolous Lola,7.0,"This was hilarious and part of my three-film Tinto Brass Sex Comedies boxed set I received from my best friend Earl last year for my 46th birthday. I was moderately interested and enthused about the idea of this boxed set after adoring his hugely controversial swords-and-sandals epic, 'Caligula'. I watched this with my lady Tammy on a fine evening with two exceptional craft beers, which we split. Heartily recommended for adventurous couples to watch together! =)"
50125,AC/DC: Let There Be Rock,9.5,This is without doubt one of the absolute classics when it comes to live performance videos. Filmed at a smaller (by comparision of todays standards) venue with minimal lighting and effects. Also one of Bon's last performances with the band at its best in this era. A must see for all fans of Rock'n Roll.
50348,The Lincoln Lawyer,8.0,"Good thriller with a round script and a performance to suit Matthew McConaughey.

Nothing to object, just enjoy!"
50357,Apollo 18,9.0,"Close up, intense and extremely claustrophobic. It's the type of horror mockumentry that I love.

If you're not into old style blackbox film, don't watch it.
If you're the type to not watch slower intro sequences maybe skip this one."
50359,Hop,4.0,"Just feltlike the bunny was being mean to the human the whole movie. I guess it was supposed to be funny, but it just felt sad and upsetting. The whole movie just kinda fell flat."
50454,Christmas Angel,7.0,"Film/TV that made my mum cry: 
<em>'Prison Break' | </em><br>
<em>'The Whale' | </em><br>
🆕 <em>'Christmas Angel'.</em>

This is a festive movie with heart. I enjoyed it. Sure it has your usual made-for-television amateur-ness/nonsense and Xmas flick cheese, though I'd rank it higher than what is produced normally by these sorta filmmakers. Kari Hawker and K.C. Clyde are decent, though Bruce Davison is the clear standout - he makes the film, no doubt.

You can't really knock a movie with such a positive message, either."
50456,Hanna,10.0,"SAIRSE RONAN IS THE ONLY PERSON TO PLAY THIS COMPLEX LONELY YET POWERFUL CHARACTER. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING FEMALE ASSASINS EVER TO BE PUT INTO FILM. SO YOUNG, SO SCARY. HERIOC"
50542,Under the Hawthorn Tree,9.0,"A very sweet and sad tale based on one of the many stories from Cultural Revolution. It feels personal since the heroine claims that she wants to be a writer, and at the end of the film she goes abroad to study. Coincidentally, the author is a Chinese (American) living in Florida who seems to know exactly how it felt living under Mao Tse Tung. It was brilliantly translated to film by the accomplished Zhang Yimou."
50544,Friends with Benefits,4.0,"Even Kunis and Timberlake bodies are not able to save this movie. Quite boring with extremely verbose but not funny dialogues and trying to be ""cool"" mixing Internet hot topics like flash mobs in a lame way."
50546,Just Go with It,8.0,Haven't seen a really good funny movie from Adam Sandler in a while. This one is really hilarious. Has a fake ex family because he lied to his current girlfriend and told her he was divorced we wih kids. When he never was.
50553,Sherlock Holmes Faces Death,7.0,"Whilst still set during WWII, this outing for Holmes and Watson is less to do with Nazis and more to do with good old-fashioned greed. Set in a stately home that is being used as a home for convalescing officers; our pair of sleuths are asked to investigate after one of Dr. Watson's patients there dies in mysterious circumstances. This is a welcome return to the more traditional storylines associated with Conan-Doyle and, as such, makes for a much better story. There is also a little humour, with Halliwell Hobbes great as the slightly (permanently) sozzled butler."
50619,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,7.0,"It may seem that this movie is totally a soap opera but it is actually a terrific adaption of the original novel with good performances from the cast.

Another question would be what kind of story we were expecting: teenagers oriented, hyper melodramatic, cheese and quite often stupid and with no sense whatsoever. Exactly as the original novel."
50646,"Crazy, Stupid, Love.",8.0,"Really good comedy, following the typical situations but with fresh unexpected turns."
50646,"Crazy, Stupid, Love.",10.0,Love this movie. This was just like my break up except the babysitter. Really hilarious though. Very entertaining!
50687,Maniac Cop 3: Badge of Silence,3.0,"This one had production issues (for one, the director walked away with only ~50 minutes of footage shot) and it's pretty apparent. This one is just plain bad, with a poor screenplay and some laughable moments that were not in the good-bad variety. And Robert Davi looked like he wanted to be anywhere else. On the plus side, the finale had some okay stunt work but by that point I just wanted it to end. **1.75/5**"
50817,On the Path,7.0,Sensitive movie about a relationship in the post-war Bosnia  and the life impacting decisions that the woman and the man have to take in the development of their lifes.
50829,Scram!,9.0,"This was great, as a fed-up, harsh judge orders Laurel and Hardy to leave town in an hour for vagrancy. A drunk but nice gentleman finds them and invites them home to his mansion, but unfortunately forgets his key, and where he lives, as the boys unwittingly help him break in to their neighbour's place, where they find the gorgeous wife of the...But why don't you see and enjoy it for yourself!"
50840,Peace Hotel,6.0,"Visually lavish wannabe John Woo western.

The cast is great but the meandering story and overuse of 'blur-fu' (obligatory in HK cinema at the time) make this a less than stellar 'farewell' film from Chow Yun-Fat to Asian film-making.

Of course, he would be back five years later with CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON"
50856,Another Fine Mess,9.0,"One of my favourites from the boys. You always get great value, especially from the works that they did with James Finlayson, who had that amazingly villainous face and the 'D'oh!' that Matt Groening would immortalize in his character, Homer Simpson. An added great bonus is the blonde siren who made far too few films before dying so young--Thelma Todd."
50907,Their First Mistake,9.0,"A great short film from the boys as Ollie is chastised by his angry wife for spending too much time going out with Stan, Ollie adopts a baby to smooth things over (!?) and are left taking care of the child themselves as the missus files for divorce and leaves him. Fine work by both a director and actors that truly understand how comedy works."
50908,Them Thar Hills,9.0,"Some genius comedic bits here, as on a much-needed vacation to soothe Ollie's nerves, the famed duo camp in the country and inadvertently get drunk on moonshine, thinking it's 'healthy mountain water'. They share its virtues with a beautiful woman and then have to deal with the crazily jealous husband. Highly recommended if and when you need a few really good laughs!"
50908,Them Thar Hills,7.0,"So poor old Ollie has gout! To help him recover, he and Stan retreat to a remote mountain shack where it transpires the local moonshiners have been hiding their produce in plain sight - in the well! Gradually the pair discover that they are rather partial to the local water. There is a fun sequence with Charlie Hall amongst some amiable antics, and though maybe we have seen a few of the scenarios elsewhere amongst this duo's output before, this is a tightly paced but simple and amusing twenty minute outing that I really quite enjoyed."
50910,Thicker Than Water,9.0,"This short film of the great comedic duo, clearly during their apex of exuberance and quality, has great comic writing by both Stan Laurel and Frank Tashlin, the latter of which utilized that mayhem early in his career with great 'Looney Tunes' cartoons and then later in live-action laugh-o-ramas starring the likes of Jerry Lewis (himself a great Laurel enthusiast) and Jayne Mansfield. This shouldn't be missed by any fans of great comedy."
50912,Tit for Tat,9.0,"A hilarious continuation of 'Them Thar Hills', as the boys try opening up a shop that just happens to be right next door to a grocery store run by the couple they met in that film...and the jealous husband still hasn't either forgotten or forgiven them. These two films together would be an excellent introduction for inquisitive people of today of Laurel and Hardy's work."
50914,Towed in a Hole,9.0,"One of Laurel and Hardy's best shorts, and one I remember from my days as a young lad, watching nightly re-broadcastings of the duo's finest moments on Canada's Global Television Channel with my parents. This one's particularly advantageous for seeing how the pair operates, as it has no one else, save for a brief appearance by favourite Billy Gilbert as the junkyard owner who is able to rip them off by selling the craft, clearly unfit for the seas, to the boys to begin with."
50915,Twice Two,8.0,"A fun and rare occurrence of Laurel and Hardy playing dual roles (the other main one being 'Brats', in which they play their own sons as well). Enjoyable albeit not one of their best."
50927,Helpmates,9.0,"A short comedic masterpiece for the boys. After watching this, you'll think twice before asking your best friend to help you clean up after a wild party before the missus comes home..."
50928,Hog Wild,6.0,"Ollie can't find his hat - and that puts him in a bad mood. When he and Stan try to put up a radio aerial on his roof so they can hear Japan that doesn't much improve his temper. The final straw comes as he is atop a ladder on a runaway car driven (more like guided) by Stan in the driving seat... Their timing is great, but it is just a bit too ""anything can go wrong will go wrong"" for me. It has a fun jazzy accompaniment and certainly still raises a chuckle."
50956,Rachida,6.0,"Interesting subject matter, though as a film I found <em>'Rachida'</em> a bit flat.

Ibtissem Djouadi leads the cast well enough, though I wasn't invested in any of the characters onscreen. The story also felt a tad repetitive and lacking in progression. The pacing is fine, yet due to the aforementioned it does a drag in a few places - though the short 93 minute run time helps in that regard.

Not a bad film one bit, but it just isn't one that I clicked with."
51052,Arthur Christmas,7.0,"A good watch.

I had a fine time watching <em>'Arthur Christmas'</em>. The plot is a little light, with a fairly simple event taking a relative while to resolve itself, but it's still a pleasant festive animated film - with neat animation.

There are a number of familiar names on the voice cast, too many to name in actual fact. My personal standout is Hugh Laurie as Steven, though James McAvoy, Bill Nighy and Jim Broadbent are all enjoyable too."
51249,Alabama Moon,6.0,"Some kind of modern Tom Sawyer.

Nothing exceptional, but good to spend an evening with the family."
51270,The Shift,0.5,"Don't waste your time. ""Dr."" Wayne Dyer's post doctorate title is fake. He spouts bald faced lies to a camera without supporting a thing he says. He treats anecdotes as evidence. This is meant to trick naive people out of their money. Just google him..."
51282,Noelle,5.0,"Okay, this review will suffer because the one I just wrote disappeared into the TMDB ether, and I didn’t like the movie enough to recreate what I just wrote.

In brief, my reaction is that the acting seems restrained at times, almost wooden, such as with Father Simeon. He seemed depressed. Plus the script was disjointed for me and the main characters just didn’t grab me. But the movie is an Indie film and it tries hard, so your reaction may well vary according to your taste."
51365,The Door,5.0,"An interesting concept no doubt, <em>'The Door'</em> just doesn't execute it all that well.

It starts off decently and I was interested in seeing where it would go. However, I feel like it lost its way very quickly and suddenly became rather underwhelming. The performances of Mads Mikkelsen (who's German was actually dubbed by Ingo Hülsmann, annoyingly) and Jessica Schwarz, while more than fine, don't set the film alight either - nor do any other elements of this 2009 release.

A disappointment all in all. Forgettable!"
51540,Horrible Bosses,8.0,Funny movie. I'm a boss at my work too. All we do is party. Nothing like this movie though.
51739,The Secret World of Arrietty,9.0,One of the most delicate and visually gorgeous movies from studios Ghibli with a great celtic OST to remember.
51828,One Day,5.0,"Simple but not original story. Hathaway's performance is good but the movie leaves a ""deja vu"" feeling from other stories fall and redemptioni stories."
52072,Clouds of May,4.0,"We're always looking for the next great Turkish film, so we watched this. It's done in a kind of Kiarostami-style, except Ceylan is no Kiarostami. It was barely watchable."
52340,Recipe for Disaster,6.0,Exactly what you would expect if your kids were left at home 'accidentally' to fend for themselves. The only difference is that they made the best of a bad situation. 🌟🌟🌟
52398,Marebito,7.0,Little pretentious but still sick enough to get me interested. A little slow for my taste.
52520,Underworld: Awakening,5.0,"Repetitive script for a very badly done mass up of FX. In addition, the cut of the movie is not properly done with scenes that seems to be unrelated one after another.

They should have left it after the first, good movie."
52528,Bloodbath at the House of Death,2.0,Was intrigued by this based on the cover but found this spoof of the supernatural horror genre to be more of a bore and terribly unfunny. There were a couple neat camera tricks but I could not wait for this to end. At least the picture and audio of Vinegar Syndrome's Blu-ray were top-notch... **1.0/5**
52633,Switchblade Sisters,6.0,"A little uneven at times but still engaging 1970s exploitation thriller with fine performances from Joanne Nail and Robbie Lee and the dialogue was pretty sharp. It's one of those movies that takes a bit to accept with a bunch of juveniles being part of an organized gang, plus you have one scene of rape that kind is never dealt with. As a whole the movie was okay. **3.0/5**"
52734,Hard to Hold,5.0,"Okay-ish romantic-music-drama where singer Rick Springfield has some decent chemistry with Janet Eilber but the acting as a whole was uneven for both of them, such as when Eilber's character finds her father dead on the floor, cringy acting there and Springfield is even worse with almost anything that was dramatic. Won't say it's a waste of time but it's also not memorable, including the music. **2.5/5**"
52841,Bachelor in Paradise,6.0,"Old fashioned but kind of charming, mostly for Lana Turner as I didn't completely buy Bob Hope in the lead role, and the final scene was just dumb, not terribly romantic. IDK, it was mildly entertaining for what it is, but can't think I'll remember about it down the line. **3.0/5**"
52943,The Telephone Box,6.0,"At 35 minute its more of a long, short than a movie but it's engaging throughout and there's always a next level to find out what will happen to him. There are views of Spain in 1972 which is interesting. It's in Spanish but could essentially be a silent film. Worth 35 minutes of your time."
53101,Manborg,4.0,"Bad on purpose is still kinda bad, but major props for the stop-motion creature design.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
53182,300: Rise of an Empire,4.0,"Did they really have to do a second movie?

More of the same but with lack of innovation and talent. The story is predictable and unconnected, the same than the battles.

Stapleton's character doesn't have the same power in screen than 300's Butler's.

Probably, the only thing to save is Eva Green although I think she is walking a path in which she is not gaining points to perform in better future movies."
53190,The Two Escobars,10.0,"I don't normally write reviews but this documentary is worth one! It's very well made and is entirely narrated by the people being interviewed which gives it a very authentic feel. 

Even if you're not into sports, the political aspects of this documentary make for a very interesting perspective. It's more about what Columbia as a nation was going through rather than about drugs or sports.

For anyone who wants to learn more about this period of history, I highly recommend The Two Escobars."
53574,Born to the West,5.0,"A gentle little runner, this, for John Wayne - a cattle drive taking the herd to Montana encounters some pretty predictable obstacles en route. It's got some fun one-liners, some good gun-fights and all-in-all, moves along well for the hour or so it takes to coral the beeves."
53596,Even the Rain,7.0,"Interesting story quite well told by Bollain.

The cast is great but not at their performance summit."
53622,The Man from Utah,5.0,"Not a bad little effort from the Duke, this - providing you can overlook his rather terrible song at the beginning. He arrives into town amidst a shoot-out and next thing he is involved in helping the marshal (Gabby Hayes) to investigate some dodgy, lethal, rodeo-rigging. The use of actuality rodeo footage rather spoiled this for me, but probably saved a few bucks which they invested in a good fun soundtrack that accompanied this fast-paced fifty minutes of adventure."
54013,The Visitor,1.0,"**What.**

Just...what.  Incoherent and not scary.  Best part was the girl cussing out the old man.  Joanne Nail can look around confused well.  I doubt that took much effort.

The house was the coolest part of the movie."
54052,Who Do I Gotta Kill?,3.0,Mobster comedy that overdoes the Italian sauce on the belabored pizza of a plot about a would-be writer who decides on gaining experience by joining his local wiseguys on the job. Overbearing in its clichéd characters with actors who only rely on overdone mannerisms. There are a few known players in it but to little effect. Hall has a blink-and-you-miss-him bit and Buscemi is unbilled.
54054,One for the Money,6.0,"Good watch, probably won't watch again, and can't whole-heartedly recommend.

This is like a New Jersey version of ""Bounty Hunter"" with a lower production value and a less believable bounty hunter, which is part of the joke.

The story is pretty dark and lacks any uplifting sense of charm, but the story structure is pretty good and there is plenty of character growth.

There is some humor and decent action, but there just isn't much to return to when it comes down to it and there are much better movies to watch, ""Domino"" for instance."
54138,Star Trek Into Darkness,3.0,"Weak story for a movie with a huge budget.

Honestly, I think you will only like it if you are a Treky. In no other way you will be able to get any logic out of it and the fact that the Captain of the space ship is the first to get out to do field work."
54518,Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,7.0,"You know, I was (except during his bad behaviour from 2013, and half of 2014) always that rare thing... a male Bieliber, and possibly am a little biased, but this is a pretty good movie. Definitely the Bielibers will enjoy it (I have to admit, being 17 years old at the time, I was grateful to be almost alone in the screen, as I got to miss screaming fangirls), but I think people who go with an open mind should enjoy it too :)"
54702,Malevolence,5.0,"I get what writer-director (and producer, editor, composer) Stevan Mena was trying to do (at least I think): an homage to 1980s slashers right down to the killer wearing a burlap-like sack over his head and a score straight out of Friday the 13th. For an independent horror movie, wasn't terrible and some of the acting was okay (more or less) but the ADR was laughably bad and there was nothing all that memorable. Passably entertainment but not much more than that."
54818,Stage Fright,7.0,"Very scary movie... Be prepared, it's not your typical comical animation"
55283,Leader,10.0,"A brilliant movie that any Tollywood fan must watch. The movie really sends a strong message unlike most other Telugu movies, and has brilliant performances. It also has brilliant cinematography. Not a borring moment in 176 minutes. Soundtrack is also brilliant. _Stop reading, start watching!_"
55301,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,8.0,This one has to be m favorite out of the series. I was cracking up. Especially when they are on the island. That's when it's the funniest.
55341,Jeepers Creepers 3,3.0,"Somehow, even compared to the massive disappointment that was _Jeepers Creepers 2_, this movie is still a letdown. If you're looking for an excuse to not give literal paedophile Victor Salva any of your your hard-earned money, here's one: _Jeepers Creepers 3_ fuckin' sucks.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
55347,Beginners,8.0,A really delightful drama with superb performances and a great editing.
55420,Another Earth,5.0,"More ambitious than interesting. A story that wants to joint an epic sci-fi moment with a drama.

Not really working although seeing the Earth in the sky is quite interesting."
55470,One Missed Call 3: Final,4.0,"Really liked the first two movies of this trilogy, but this third entry, while had some interesting ideas and even some social commentary with characters fighting one another to stay alive, the creepy factor was non-existent, acting was rather bland and had some lame moments, most notably attempting to defeat ghost girl via mass e-mails. Shame it ended this way. **2.0/5**"
55492,Second Sight,10.0,"""Cheaply Funny"" I think would be the best way to describe this.

It's not really made well, the direction is lacking, and the budget is obviously low...but that really doesn't matter, it's a comedy, and a comedy on a show-string budget still works wonders if it's done right.

And this is done right. The timing is perfect. The acting is hysterical. The plot is far out and completely stupid--and that is a plus not a negative.

It's low budget, low brow, completely stupid entertainment, but it entertains and is positively hysterical. To watch it is to love it."
57521,Black Bread,8.0,"A different story in the after times of the Spanish Civil War.

Cleverly, it mixes a thriller with the destruction of the naïve childhood of the main character.

Who is good and who is bad, who is true and who lies is unclear as the events that lead to the current situation. A must to see in nowadays Spanish film making."
57738,Cross My Heart,5.0,"While not the best romantic plot and Martin Short was absolutely miscast in the male lead, Annette O'Toole was great and made the movie work as well as it did. I think Paul Reiser would've been better in the lead over Short... **2.5/5**"
57800,Ice Age: Continental Drift,8.0,These movies are just good all them. Haven't made or seen a bad one yet. They all make me laugh.
58151,Fright Night,7.0,"Quite a decent teen horror movie. Maybe it lacks some jokes and the story, as always, is quite stereotypical, but the formula works well.

Yelchin, Farrel, Tennant and Poots make a good team."
58182,The Stooge,8.0,My favorite film of Dean and Jerry together. A good screen play and good performances by the whole cast. A bit more drama than the usual Martin and Lewis comedy. A fun film.
58224,Mr. Popper's Penguins,6.0,It's a good family movie to watch. Other then that it's pretty dumb. Inherits some penguins and gives them to his kids for there birthday and tries to hide it from his landlord.
58233,Johnny English Reborn,2.0,Some unaccuracys: He goes to Honk Kong and ends up in Macau.. Mozambique President making a speech in english for is people?!
58233,Johnny English Reborn,3.0,"_Johnny English Reborn_ takes what we got from the first film and then firmly places an even better cast into an even worse movie.

_Final rating: ★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._"
58272,Super Speeders 2 - Across America,5.0,"The clips are actually pretty good if you like the ""Gumball 3000"" type of thing. The sound quality and TERRIBLE music are what really ruin this video."
58431,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,4.0,"Better than it had any right being, but still not very good.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
58443,Blue Crush 2,4.0,Has absolutely nothing at all to do with first movie. It's about a spoiled rich girl who is trying to visit and surf at all the spots her dead mother did. The comedy is awful and so is the movie.
58457,Burning Paradise,8.0,"This hugely under-rated wu xia epic was a change of scenery for Ringo Lam, master of the urban crime film.

Coming off like a twisted Chinese TEMPLE OF DOOM this film was a bomb in HK, due to the darkness of its nature as well as the lack of recognisable stars. Now it has taken its place as one of the most striking films of that era of HK cinema.

And anything with the stunning Carman Lee in it is worth a watch."
58574,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,8.0,"Probably the third time seeing this (once in theaters, another when it came out on Blu-ray) and still highly enjoyable, even think this is a tad better than the first if only because of Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty as a great adversary to Holmes. **3.75/5**"
58789,Bleeders,5.0,Goofy prosthetics and campy acting drape moodily over a solid story to produce something odd but watchable. Like a lost X-Files episode with a hot sex scene.
58857,13 Assassins,5.0,Much predictable and brutal. Just some action movie in which 13 guys kill by hundreds ...
59001,"Take That: Look Back, Don't Stare",10.0,"Incredible documentary about the biggest reformation on modern pop music, as erstwhile Take That member Robbie William, many years after establishing himself as a global megastar, rejoins the 'boy band' he left in such contentious circumstances.

Through all the conflicts and uncertainty they emerge with a phenomenal album called 'Progress' and go on to launch the biggest UK tour of all time."
59108,Tower Heist,8.0,"A fabulous movie.
I know some would say it's stupid and empty of any sense. I say: I don't care I liked it very much and I've watched it seven times. It must be seen."
59108,Tower Heist,9.0,"I don't get why everybody hates this! Okay, Alan Alda's character showed his true colours little too soon, but the rest of the film paid homage to your 80s-90s comic caper. Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy were terrific.

And for me, this is a kind of film I would watch on Thanksgiving. It is a holiday special."
59158,The Death Kiss,6.0,"When actor and lothario Myles Brent is killed whilst filming, there are no shortage of suspects. His leading lady ""Marcia"" (Adrienne Ames) is arrested and her suitor sets out to find the real culprit. On the face of it, it's just a routine whodunnit and has little to distinguish it; but David Manners (""Drew"") and Bela Lugosi (""Steiner"") complement each other well; the writing is quite light-hearted, mostly well-paced and there is just about enough from the supporting cast to keep it interesting - though maybe 70 minutes was 10/12 minutes too long."
59402,Shaolin Mantis,8.0,"As others have complained, the first half can be boring just because it's mostly plot; however, once you get to 45 minutes in, expect an hour straight of kick-ass, blistering choreography. Don't blink! I was leaning towards a 7/10, but the action is just good enough that I bumped it up. Get that 88 Films blu-ray while it's available!"
59436,Midnight in Paris,8.0,"Really nice movie, done with a great delicacy.

Worth watching to get in love with Paris but it is also a great story of self knowledge and evolution."
59440,Warrior,6.0,"Edgerton, Morrison and Hardy are good but Nolte is just spectacular.

Other than that, the movie is really fun but the story is nothing new and the ending is not even working."
59440,Warrior,8.0,"The story isn't particularly new, but the writing and the actors do a REALLY convincing job of making you believe in the characters struggles. Don't expect the movie to deliver on the many promises it makes though, they cut the last 10 minutes of film too early. That's my biggest gripe with it and why I wouldn't give this a higher rating."
59558,Miami Connection,6.0,"Hard to rate a movie like this. It's absolutely bizarre and yet hilarious. Terrible script, dialogue, acting, fight chorography, baffling random scenes. It has it all and then some. I can truly commend the star/director Y.K. Kim who seemed to be genuine, kind of endearing really. Oh, and those 80s songs written for the movie, *chef's kiss* **3.0/5**"
59678,Attack the Block,8.0,"An alien invasion hits the ""hood"" in London reeking havoc with the local gangs. Excellent performances by all invoived including a breakout role for John Boyega (or Star Wars fame)."

59709,Britannic,10.0,"One of the most underrated movies of all time. The screenplay is well-written, the Titanic-style story is dramatic, great acting, memorable characters, catchy soundtrack and beautiful CGI even for 2000 standards.

Britannic is just classic as the Concorde movie and the Black Cadillac movie."
59738,Girls Nite Out,3.0,"The first 45 minutes I was bored and didn't care about any of these characters and their relationships being set up, and honestly there were a few I couldn't distinguish from others. The remaining 40-minutes had a couple okay kills but I found myself zoning out a time or two. This is just another forgettable (and bland) slasher film to come out of the early 80s. **1.5/5**"
59828,Killer McCoy,4.0,"Overall a decent boxing flick with Mickey Rooney playing his regular part: scrappy, down, up, down and then in love. The weakest points are when some very improbable (and unnecessary) plot choices are used that make me cringe (like expecting a very alcoholic braggart of a father to keep a secret). But what can you expect from a B Mickey Rooney flick?"
59917,Cotton Comes to Harlem,8.0,"A very different but strong angle on the typical Blaxploitation flick. I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately I haven't seen a lot of Ossie Davis' work, either directing (which he does here) or acting (besides 'Bubba Ho-Tep' from late in his career), but it makes me want to check out a lot more. Well worth your trouble to find, worth buying and rewatching, in fact."
59961,Safe House,8.0,"Tries really hard to be a Bourne-like espionage-thriller and while the action sequences aren't as well done, still has some entertaining moments. Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington have some great scenes together. Kind of surprised, given it's Universal, there hadn't been a few direct-to-video sequels at this point... **3.75/5**"
59967,Looper,4.0,The plot is full of flaws. Quite like a even worse inception.
59967,Looper,5.0,"neither here nor there

Time travel can be an exciting plot device - if the writers take time to check and get everything right. Unfortunately, with Looper, they did not. Nor did director or producers choose a clear direction what this movie was supposed to be, what its pace and atmosphere should be like. So it turned out to be full of wasted potential. Good ideas, characters, situations, plot elements it all had at some points - but none developed, really. 

That's more disappointing that if it had had no potential. Wasted opportunities... in a loop."
60086,Babysitter Wanted,5.0,"Had its moments I guess but tonally uneven with the first half a standard horror-thriller while the second half was more supernatural horror. I think under a more experienced director, with some rewrites to the screenplay, could've made for an entertaining flick but instead it's choppy editing with some gross horror thrown in toward the end. I will say at least the lead Sarah Thompson was alright. 2.5/5"
60163,BECK,8.0,"A great film, with good music, that didn't allow me to hear the main vocalist's voice."
60243,A Separation,9.0,"Great movie around and simple yet neat story with great characters, script and performances.

You can totally believe the story is just happening at your building stairs."
60304,Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.0,Nice fantasy and action movie. Interesting to see again Gemma Arterton and good FX but nothing else to remark.
60308,Moneyball,6.0,"A movie done to the size and skills of Brad Pitt. The story is interesting enough and is well driven and directed. Hill does a good job, mostly because nobody had seen him doing a serious role before."
60599,Arbitrage,4.0,"The problems of a rich man to keep his position with his affairs and frauds.

Nothing really special"
60747,Red Dawn,2.0,"Yes, it is that bad.

You may start with low expectations, very low even, but even then, you'll be disappointed.

I'll not go into details, not wasting more time on this turd. Even if you're into trashy movies - avoid this one."
60977,The Pee-wee Herman Show on Broadway,2.0,"watching this was was like was looking through the perspective of a serial killer. After taking cocaine!


To clarify, I meant the serial killer, not me! In case there was any confusion.
Basically, I didn't like it. That's what I meant."

61744,Super Bowl XXXVI Champions: New England Patriots,7.0,"It is fun watching highlights from that magical season for Patriot fans, but it seems like they could have done much better. It was their first Super Bowl win, after all. Wasn’t it  worth a more in-depth depth look than ninety minutes allows for? But I am sure most Patriot fans were glad just to be able to put it on their shelves. Who knew so many more championships would follow?"
61891,Anonymous,8.0,Good entertaining fictional historic movie. Just don't try to chew on whether the history is true or not but enjoy the plot.
61980,Seeing Heaven,2.0,"It's so bad, you'll feel like you're losing your sanity while you're watching it. This is partially intentional, so it does slightly redeem itself by the end, but not nearly enough."
62211,Monsters University,10.0,"This is a great movie. The quality of animation is amazing, and they captured the University feel perfectly. Lots of fun little scenes, backgrounds, and homages to the original movie."
62213,Dark Shadows,4.0,"I'm sorry but I am incapable of buying 50-year-old Johnny Depp as the immortal, youthful, irresistible heir to his father's New World empire. Maybe in a better movie, I would have been too distracted to be bothered by it, but this is Tim Burton's 2012 reboot of _Dark Shadows_, so that was not the case. 

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
62214,Frankenweenie,7.0,"Good stuff, unmistakably Tim Burton.

<em>Frankenweenie</em> is a solid stop-motion horror film from Disney. Interesting plot, coupled with a suitable cast and untypical animation. It's also in black-and-white, which doesn't hamper things at all - I, in a weird sort of way, kinda forgot it was b/w for vast portions.

Charlie Tahan voices the lead character, Victor Frankenstein. You also have well-known names in Winona Ryder (Elsa), Martin Short (Edward) and Catherine O'Hara (Susan). I also liked Martin Landau as Rzykruski. There's decent humour amongst those characters, too.

Worth a watch, for sure."
62368,Cat Shit One,1.0,"War is good? Really, anyone taking kids to see this is ""part of the system"" and are programing them for the system. Its this kind of shit that is keeping the corrupt system growing."
62835,Colombiana,7.0,"Solid revenge/assassination thriller, story has some very emotional moments, well acted even, which still somehow fail to engage the audience. The action sequences are mostly very good contemporary quality, except for too many blur cuts in a certain ""boss fight"".

Pity this falls flat in some parts; main character(s) would've enough substance for a few sequels if developed further.

No regrets having watched it, I was entertained, but wouldn't re-watch."
62835,Colombiana,10.0,"QUALITY ACTING FROM ZOE SALADANA.  THE SCRIPT IS A WEAK , STORY GREAT GREAT FEMALE REVENGE FILM.  KIND OF REMINDS ME OF ""THE PROFESSIONAL""."
63460,Vice Squad,6.0,"Decent enough 1980s crime-thriller that actually does feature some good performances, most notably from what has to be a great name, Wings Hauser. That said, the cheesy and laughably awful opening and closing title songs really do not match the tone of the movie at all."
63498,Chico & Rita,7.0,"The animation, music and look back to the history in Cuba is very nice but the story is quite old and told in better ways in many other movies."
63555,Leap Year,3.5,"Quite a disturbing movie without much purpose nor rhythm.

Although the character is believable in current life time, the progression of the story is not."
63687,Circo,8.0,"Fine doc. about one of the many small circuses throughout the world struggling to keep their way of life viable. Good,talented and hardworking people. Very different existence than mundane town life. Hopefully the small circuses of the world will never strike tents for the last time."
63749,Swamp Shark,3.0,"Maybe not the worst of its kind, but that's pretty damn far from high praise when you consider the company that _Swamp Shark_ keeps.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
63834,Cirkus Columbia,6.5,A nice picture of the usual life that was happening in the peace time just before the conflict in the balcanic regions and the life of a broken family that only gets some days together in the impass between the communism and the war.
63971,Deserter,7.0,"Kinda good, kinda bad.

For the most part, though, I did mostly like <em>'Deserter'</em>. It's got a weird sorta vibe to it and feels cheaply made, though with that said the locations are convincing enough. Tom Hardy does well in just his second movie, though does sport a very iffy French accent. Paul Fox is alright in (despite what that presumably retrospective poster suggests) the lead role, he looks a little like Donald O'Connor in this, so there's that.

I can fully see why some may dislike this. For me, it's one to narrowly file under 'good'."
64129,D-Day the Sixth of June,7.0,"The romances seemed completely unnecessary, and took away from an otherwise well-made war film, though had I been around at the time, I would have done my best to woo Dana Wynter myself. Being a huge Edmond O'Brien fan, this got extra marks from me. Worth a watch if you like films from this era, or war films in general...and a purchase and rewatches, if you are fans of any of the stars or of director Koster."
64246,Colorful,4.5,"Technically good anime, but the story is quite weak and mushy."
64557,Playing with Fire,3.0,"I hate these surrealistic, artistic BS movies and this one just was a pain to sit through. There's not even anything interesting going on visually and the acting pretty mundane (or maybe that was on purpose). Some pretty faces (and bodies) but as a whole is a movie that is patched together to confuse rather than challenge. **1.5/5**"
64635,Total Recall,10.0,"Totally class. Totally absorbing. Totally worth a watch...or ten dozen. There's a great story here, some great and convincing characters and mind-blowingly imaginative visuals. Not to mention two kick-ass women! If you want a rollercoaster ride from the comfort of your own sofa this is the movie for you. It's even worth putting up with Colin Farrell for."
64682,The Great Gatsby,2.5,"Baz Luhrmann repeats what he did with Rome + Juliet and creates a horrible moster full of FX and exaggeration.

Still, the cast performs well."
64682,The Great Gatsby,8.0,"An over the top portrayal of the classic novel, while at times excessive and tasteless, it truly hits home with the novels original critique on the excess of the time. The cast was **excellent**, the movie stayed true to the novel in all the most important ways. I personally feel the modern soundtrack wasn't appropriate in several cases, but a couple flawless executions."
64682,The Great Gatsby,10.0,"I thought that movie was some shitty old-school musical, but boy, I was wrong. A gem, must watch."
64686,47 Ronin,7.0,"I didn't have much expectations for this movie but it was enjoyable enough. Maybe it has some holes that were created to appeal the action movies viewer. I also ""borrows"" without shame from ""Princess Mononoke"" and other movies but, as a whole, it is decent enough."
64688,21 Jump Street,7.0,"The Jump Street reboot, amazingly, just works. Lord & Miller were somehow able to completely nail this, to my shock, and now a _21/22 Jump Street_ re-watch is a yearly occurrence in my household.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
64688,21 Jump Street,6.0,"Very funny movie. An unlikely cop, and a airhead cop. Equals 2 very hilarious cops."
64689,Killing Them Softly,4.0,"“Killing Them Softly” has a great noir setting, superb acting and excellent cinematography, but due to the endless pointless conversations, the thin storyline ends up being extremely incoherent.

4/10"
64690,Drive,10.0,One of the best films ever made in my opinion. Nothing about this felt boring like people said. Just don't go in expecting an action movie. 10/10 Masterpiece.
64720,Take Shelter,6.0,"I do love slow-paced thriller films and this is exactly that. Having said that, there is something that makes me uneasy about the ending. It is up to so many interpretations that the writer / director of the film didn’t know himself how to end otherwise a close-to-brilliant story with a decent acting.

Would I watch it again? Possibly. Would I make my friends watch it? I guess so."
64807,Grudge Match,4.0,"Pretty much bang on average.
It's a solid 5 maybe 6 at a push ratings wise, but, and excluding the annoying over done Kevin Hart; the amount of product placements was absurd

They were so in the face the only thing to do was count them, a total of 20 within the first hour and then I just gave up.

It wasn't all bad but damn, -2 for the above stated issues."
65015,Sweetie,1.0,I dislike this film so much. Mental illness is portrayed absolutely horribly in it. None of the characters are likeable whatsoever. A waste of time that I would recommend to no one unless you want to be very annoyed.
65055,Shark Night 3D,3.0,"My roommate mistakenly thought we were going to watch a movie called ""Shark Knight"". If only.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
65057,The Descendants,4.0,"Sorry, but this movie was unwatchable for me. The premise is clever enough. The wife of a romantically unavailable husband has a fatal accident and he's forced to repair his relationship with his alienated daughters. It's good chick-flick material and no doubt, all the women scored it high and not only because of George Clooney. I normally love his work, but this premise is so poorly executed in this film that even he can't find a solid stage on which to base his acting. There are too many good movies out there to waste time watching this one."
65057,The Descendants,9.0,"I really like this movie...

I've watched it many times and am always entertained. I like the Hawaii locations, the young Woodley, Clooney's clumsy but morally accommodating character, and the confrontations with 
life's inevitable surprises. All the characters gel, and the 
story moves forward with some sadness as well as some laughs.

8 out of 10 stars"
65114,The Cockleshell Heroes,6.0,"HM Royal Marines don't tend to be centre-stage in many films depicting their wartime escapades. This one recounts their exploits trying to canoe up the Garonne and attack some vital Nazi shipping. The plot is quite interesting but both José Ferrer and Trevor Howard miss their targets - both performances are as strained as their on-screen relationship purports to be. It does celebrate the valiant efforts, however, of this daring raid with great looking photography and Ferrer directs this with a true sense of the jeopardy of the whole enterprise."
65252,Deadly Instincts,5.0,"**A Nipply Good Time.**

**Q.** Is this movie good?  **A.** No.

**Q.** Is the acting good?  **A.**  I've seen worse.
The accents aren't great.

**Q.** Are the effects good?  **A.**  They're decent.

**Q.** Are the costumes good?  **A.**  Hurr hurr.

I do like the one woman in green latex/spandex.  A fetishier Jade from Beyond Good and Evil.

Seriously though, a lot of fetish fuel in this.

I've seen **MUCH** worse on Rifftrax."
65296,Humanité,5.0,"A film with people and two final twists.

I like movies where the characters are like real people not just stereotypes. All people have some good and some bad, they make stupid things and clever things.

And sometimes they surprise us."
65596,Unidentified Flying Oddball,6.0,"Average.

I don't like or dislike <em>'Unidentified Flying Oddball'</em>. It features a cool concept, but the film never really gets overly intriguing while the cast are rather plain and uninteresting.

Dennis Dugan never really works for me as Tom. I feel his character is way too content with what occurs, especially at the beginning - no surprise, no shock... nothing. That's odd to me, given what occurs. Jim Dale, who is excellent in 1978's <em>'Hot Lead and Cold Feet'</em>, is underwhelming. Kenneth More, meanwhile, is alright as King Arthur.

In a word, forgettable. Glad it only lasts 93 minutes."
65759,Happy Feet Two,6.0,I liked the first movie better than this one. The songs were better too. Eric was really cute but I guess I'm just too biased for not liking him because of how he was with Mumble.
65759,Happy Feet Two,4.0,"Seemed like they tried to hard to make this one good. They tried to be more cute with part 2, it seemed like to me. Plus there's so many penguins that it's hard to know who's who."
65871,Zombie Undead,2.0,"Not even diehard fans of the zombie genre should put themselves through this swill. The problems are almost all because of the low budget (the rest of them are because of how apallingly derivative it is) but they are too glaringly obvious to get past.

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"
66006,Tiger Claws,6.0,"Entertaining enough kung-fu action flick that certainly doesn't have the best writing and has some stilted dialogue, but Cynthia Rothrock kicks ass as usual and it never bored or wore out its welcome. **3.0/5**"
66195,The Perfect Host,5.0,"The staging is much more interesting than the development of the story.

A wannabe that fades at the half, although the performances are quite OK."
67109,Delhi Belly,8.5,"This is Nice Time pass movie. Like a Bit Guy Richie movies - RocknRolla,Snatch,Lock Stock and two smoking barrels but made in Indian context."
67302,It Happened at Lakewood Manor,5.0,"Just another creature-like horror film with similar plots to Tarantulas and Terror Out of the Sky, both I watched last week. This one is watchable but the threat of ants wasn't very convincing or scary. I did like seeing Brian Dennehy in an early role as the police chief and at least the acting was passable. **2.75/5**"
67327,Muay Thai Warrior,10.0,If you like martial arts and Samurai movies you will love this one.  It has a good share of action and drama with great acting and film sequences.  The main character grows from just fulfilling a mission to finding a love for a country and it's people.  Enjoy.
67375,The Story of Alexander Graham Bell,4.0,"Worth a watch once, but that's it. The reason for watching, the invention of the Telephone, is largely glossed over and background noise. The main thrust of this story is a little too Mills & Boon, Bell falling in love with the deaf daughter of one of his backers. Very much an aged Romantic Drama of the early talkies era."
67398,The Dallas Connection,5.0,"A bit better than Enemy Gold with some semblance of a plot though a good chunk was a bit dull, however Julie Strain was striking as usual. The acting as normal was bad as was the dialogue, still found some parts to be entertaining enough once past the slower moments. **2.5/5**"
68718,Django Unchained,9.0,"A highly entertaining yet disturbing film with superb cast and performances for an audience who would likely never consider watching a film fundamentally about slavery, where Tarantino is masterfully and emphatically navigating and exposing the complex layers of the violent and dehumanizing system of slavery."
68721,Iron Man 3,8.0,"When I first saw this in 2013, strongly disliked it but decided to give it another watch during my re-visit of the MCU and... kind of enjoyed it, quite a bit. Still not fond of the twist wasting  a great actor in Ben Kingsley to be a decoy Mandarin and instead having a cheesy one with Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian and his lame ""I AM THE MANDORIAN!"" line. But all in all, a good step up from Iron Man 2. **3.75/5**"
68721,Iron Man 3,6.0,Once again another movie with very little action. Im really disappointed in these movies. Sure the stories are good but that's it.
68721,Iron Man 3,4.0,"[MAJOR SPOILERS]
This is one of the most disappointing movies ever. From trailers and earlier parts of the movie, the Mandarin is hyped up to be this super powerful terrorist threat against Iron Man. I expected it to end with Stark defending America against some big plot or scheme from the Mandarin. Instead, at the end he is revealed to be some pussy in a cave.

4/10"
68724,Elysium,7.0,"If you want an action movie, this one really rocks. There are some unneeded clichés but, all in all, is quite an enjoying journey.

In addition, Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and, remarkably, Sharlto Copley perform at great level."
68724,Elysium,8.0,"A little heavy-handed at times with the social commentary though that's Neil Blomkamp's thing with all his movies at this point, however still was entertained throughout, the effects were mostly good (a few shots were a bit iffy) and Matt Damon is good in the lead. Didn't exactly land the emotional impact they were going for in the end but still was enjoyed this quite a bit and think it's actually better than District 9 (which I feel is overrated outside of the visual effects) and far and away better than Chappie. **3.75/5**"
68726,Pacific Rim,8.5,"First I want to say I liked this movie. I was surprised, I've been hearing bad reviews but I can't see big problem. The only issues was with the story. Apart from that the graphics where very good. The actors where okay (no major actors) and the baddies (no spoilers) where well thought out and graphically impressive (same for the robots).

All in all a good movie."
68726,Pacific Rim,7.0,"This movie has almost everything that is expected from it so just relax lay back with the pop corn and your soft drink and enjoy.

Just to make noticeable the remarkable few amount of females featuring in the movie and how bad is that Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro just copy Evangelion's idea without giving anything back."
68726,Pacific Rim,5.0,"Watching a CGI heavy movie 5 years following its release doesn't sound like such a hot idea, but in the case of Pacific Rim nothing really drew me out of the experience in terms of aging animation.

However, the film itself was an 'okay' at best. Aside from the spectacle CGI fights of giants robots versus giant alien monsters it doesn't offer anything of value. This is one of those movies you can safely keep on your second monitor and zone out in between the set piece fight scenes."
68728,Oz the Great and Powerful,2.0,"Overdone movie for children, with tiring tricks thought for 3D but a poor animation that becomes boring for its colorfulness. If you are a kid, you may enjoy, if you are an adult, better pass ..."
68728,Oz the Great and Powerful,7.0,"I thought this would be a dumb movie, but I was wrong. Pretty good movie and very funny. He's a magician who the people of Oz thinks he's powerful. He trys to con them all into thinking he has special powers."
68734,Argo,7.5,"Nowhere near best picture worthy, but truly excellent suspense building. The 2 hours certainly fly by with this one. Alan Arkin is a joy to watch."
68734,Argo,6.0,"Surprisingly winner of the Oscar award for the best movie.

It is a reasonably well done picture but nothing that interesting nor well threaded that the story telling would be worth mentioning. Actually, probably the contrary.

The cast is quite good in any case."
68735,Warcraft,7.0,"I really was expecting very little from this movie, but I was surprised. Good action and quite a decent story. Not all fresh, but well put together.

I think the biggest pity is the lack of talent of Fimmel. He learnt how to perform for Vikings and he lays another flat copy of the same character.

Positive points to the very good OST by Djawadi."
68735,Warcraft,5.0,"The beginning is confusing and poorly acted, but it gets better as it goes.  The CGI looks seamless with the live-action."
68818,Blackthorn,5.0,"Sam Shepard performs well, the idea of the story is interesting and the photography and staging in Bolivia are breathtaking.

But the performance of the story into a movie is boring and it hurts to see such a good actor as Noriega playing such a bad role.

Clearly, the direction failed to make a good set of individual promises into a better mix."
68863,The Heroin Busters,7.0,Some good action here and there and photography alongside the charms of both Fabio Testi and David Hemmings has plenty of the cliches of the Italian crime-drama though not as many odd scenes that often perplexes me while watching these movies. Not great but more than watchable all things considered. **3.5/5**
68884,Rush Week,5.0,"Watchable (just barely) but also highly predictable 1980s slasher that has some good-bad moments here and there, but nearly enough to make it a recommendation. The lead actress, Pamela Ludwig, was at least easy on the eyes and gives an okay performance, but everything else really doesn't work. Heck, the end feels like the culmination of a Scooby-Doo episode. **2.25/5**"
69160,Hells Angels Forever,9.5,"Great Expose of the famous biker group aka 81's HAMCO, AFFA, Hells Angels Forever. A must view."
69266,Special Bulletin,8.0,A worryingly realistic docudrama about a group of terrorists who want to force Nuclear weapons to be disarmed by threatening to explode one themselves.
69270,Super Hybrid,4.0,"Should have been much worse than it was.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
69557,The Pumpkin Eater,9.0,"First rate in every respect: plot, script, B&W cinematography, editing, music… but the real icing on the cake would be the performances of Bancroft and Finch, which I suspect are the best of their careers"
69576,Who Saw Her Die?,6.0,"Middling Italian murder-mystery has its moments but like many of these giallo films, you get some puzzling editing decisions and distracting dubbing. As a fan of crime-dramas, this at least kept my attention but this isn't high on my list in the giallo-type movies. **3.0/5**"
69578,What Have They Done to Your Daughters?,7.0,"Pretty good Italian mystery-thriller that has some poignant moments and thankfully not too many weird scenes that I often see in these kind of Italian-produced films (the only one was the media publishing a fully nude picture of a woman hanging). Otherwise, some good scenes and acting from the two main leads weren't bad.

One of the better ""giallo"" movies I've seen among the ones I've recently watched. **3.75/5**"
69828,Breaking In,6.0,"Okay drama-crime-comedy featuring two fine performances from Burt Reynolds and Casey Siemaszko and while the crime elements were fun, the drama part was a bit bland. Nothing I'd watch again but might be worth checking out especially if you're a Reynolds's fan. **3.25/5**"
70135,The Base,5.0,"Its pacing is on the slow side but this is a cheap, competent, minimalistic actioner that's worth a watch if you're a fan of the genre."
70160,The Hunger Games,7.5,"Very well made movie with quality writing, acting and cinematography. 

**Pros**: strong performance from the star. Technically excellent.

**Cons**: Seems to me that the ending was premature but perhaps intentionally so - for a sequel? Character development is largely weak but there are a lot of characters and already a long movie so I suspect a lot was left on the cutting room floor.

Despite some weakness, still a compelling movie worth a watch if not up to all of the hype."
70160,The Hunger Games,5.0,"I don't really know what's so special about this movie. I found ""The Running Man"" or ""Total Recall"" much more deep thought than this. Is it maybe that the main character is a female?

Still, it is entertaining and, in this regard, it does its job."
70608,LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace,5.0,"A forgettable short.

<em>'LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace'</em> is ultimately harmless, yet doesn't do anything that makes itself memorable whatsoever. There are some minorly amusing scenes with Darth Vader, but not much else. It's probably too long, even at only 22mins, too."
70925,Oranges and Sunshine,8.0,"Immensely powerful and moving. This is a story that needs to be told. Of the effects of the forced migration of children. Angering and saddening, I shouted through my tears watching this. The same truths as in Philomena told very differently but equally harrowing. Brilliantly acted and by everyone but of course by Emily Watson as always."
70981,Prometheus,7.0,"Good Sci-fi 👍🏾

Finding a map left by our creators and then following it lightyears away for the search of the meaning of life, and immortality... Forget the horror part of the film, that plot alone had me fully immersed.

_I watch this one at least twice a year. _"
70981,Prometheus,10.0,"Follows greatly the Hero with a Thousand Faces, very well executed.

Probably the best science-fiction ever made, along Kubrick's Space Odyssey 2001, where you can actually learn something about true **technology**.

Well done for those who can see. We need more!"
71006,Lady L,5.0,"This is a comedy that really doesn't quite work. The casting is odd and Paul Newman never really looks comfortable in his role. Sophia is gorgeous as always however, and David Niven is pretty good. Peter Ustinov wrote the screenplay, is the director and has a cameo appearance as well."
71141,Jake Speed,5.0,"Not a great pulp action-adventure flick with a lead actor with not a whole lot of charisma, still is harmless time-waster and at least had some passably entertaining moments with a comically fun turn by John Hurt as the villain. Clearly was hoping to be in the same vain as Raiders of the Lost Ark, just without the talent in front and behind the camera, but for what it is, it wasn't terrible, just nothing I'd really revisit. **2.5/5**"
71552,American Reunion,7.0,Ahh the gang is all back for the final movie. I just wish everyone would have ended back to the way it started. Them as couples like before.
71612,Minty the Assassin,1.0,"Zero redeeming qualities outside maybe lead ""actress"" Elina Madison was pretty cute. **0.5/5**"
71668,Piranha 3DD,4.0,"Inventive title, 'Hoff cameo, Josh cut off his penis.

_Piranha 3DD_ leans in hard on the stupid factor of the franchise, had this been coupled with a little more humour, that'd totally work, unfortunately, it's more dumb than fun. Still a pretty good time if this is your sort of thing, but less so than even its predecessor.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
71676,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,6.0,Not any where close to being as good as the first. At least it still has Nicholas Cage. He's the only one from part one in this movie. It's just an ok movie.
71676,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,6.0,Not any where close to being as good as the first. At least it still has Nicholas Cage. He's the only one from part one in this movie. It's just an ok movie.
71679,Resident Evil: Retribution,6.0,"Alice is going through an alternate world. When she finally snaps out of it, she finds herself trapped in and underworld city."
71859,We Need to Talk About Kevin,7.0,"Deeply disturbing and utterly engaging.

Not one I can really see myself watching again. But I'm very glad to have watched it the once. Superbly cast and acted. Brilliant photographed and amazing direction. Not to be missed for those who can handle the subject matter.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._"
71880,Jack and Jill,6.0,"Weird to see Adam Sandler as a woman. I thought this would be more like a comedy role, but he was legitimately trying to play a serious role as a female. It was kind of disturbing then funny."
71944,How Awful About Allan,7.0,"Pretty decent moody, intense, creepy psychological thriller with two of my favourite thespians in that department--Anthony Perkins and Julie Harris. It's a tad claustrophobic and difficult to get into at the start, because of this aforementioned intensity, but if you stick with it, it's quite intrinsically rewarding and definitely not a late-night waste of 90 minutes.

When Perkins' 'Allan' picks up a picture and says, 'Mother,' I couldn't help but smile. What an interesting and ill-fated actor."
72007,Malice in the Palace,8.0,This one deserves a higher rating. All the slapping and hitting routines are used in every episode and they get old fast but this one has some great scenes with the dog and cat that really elevate the comedy above most others. It has been colorized so that's a extra treat. Don't miss it!
72160,Yellowstone Kelly,6.0,"The definition of lacklustre. Needed more action to make up for the slowness.

I'm not saying <em>'Yellowstone Kelly'</em> is anything all that bad, as it isn't. However, it simply fails to make for an entertaining Western. Clint Walker (Kelly) and Edd Byrnes (Harper) don't have the necessary chemistry, though are likeable. None of the other characters, including the inappropriately cast Native Americans, are all that developed.

It has recognisable Western themes, so fits in under those requirements I guess. It's just simply not exciting or enjoyable, it's very bland in truth. Doubt I'll remember this one."
72176,Hostage High,8.0,Bringing one of the school shootings to the big screen. Pretty good movie too. Has some rage against a teacher. Also takes the school students hostage too.
72197,The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!,5.0,"Given the name, it took me a long time to understand that this wasn't a sequel to something. But I watched it anyway, because I was short on 2012 movies for my best to worst list. _Adventure with Scientists!_ will probably end up somewhere around the middle of that list.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
72197,The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!,8.0,"A rediculously fun animated film for everyone to enjoy.

Pirates! In an adventure with Scientists! has an amazing cast with humorous moments and of course, the beards!
Hugh Grant is just funny, and the same goes for this film!"
72252,Seeing Double,7.0,"<em>Seeing Double</em> is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination. But the plot is intentionally ridiculous and cringe-worthy, the acting is mostly passable, the cast is likeable and the laughs are there (however weak they may be). I can't bring myself to give this a rating lower than three stars. Call it childhood nostalgia. (★★★)"
72331,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,3.0,"My expectations were pretty low, but I somehow actually ended up liking it even less than I thought I might. The big setpieces seem to be what _Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter_ is all about, and they are **so bad**. Just abysmal.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
72571,Paranormal Activity 3,5.0,"A tad better than the first if only because at 84-minutes there's not as much filler and a couple creepy scenes. Still not great with forgettable characters but at least watchable, although it was a bridge too far with the HD-quality level of video for a camera from 1988. **2.5/5**"
72571,Paranormal Activity 3,8.0,My favorite one out of the series. Goes back when they were little kids. This is how it all begin. Lots of hauntings going. This is how I wish the other 2 made before this one was.
72882,Operation: Daybreak,4.0,"The plot is certainly interesting, even more for quite an important event during the WWII, but the movie doesn't really add anything to the story that cannot be read in a quick glance to the Wikipedia.

The cast performs as if they would be robots, with poor dialogues, and the directing feels like if it would be done with a ruler and following a strict method. Not too bad in the latter, but it doesn't feel natural at all."
72976,Lincoln,7.0,"It lacked a big deal of rhythm but the revision of the history and, specially, the great performance by Day-Lewis makes it a movie worth watching."
73128,Bruc: The Manhunt,6.5,"Interesting hollywood style movie set in Spain during the Napoleón invasion.

The cast is not bad, specially Juan José Ballesta and Astrid Bergés-Frisbey but some parts of the story, dialogues and, mainly, changes of stage and camera helicopter POV ""a la"" ""Lord of the Rings"" are not that well done and a little bit abused."
73262,Hell,7.0,"While not very original and quite predictable and having a very high contrast not only in post processing but also in characters, the narrative is still quite convincing and the acting is passable too. Possibly as a budget restraint, the lack of cinematic mattes and ambitious sets add to the realistic feel. The use of overexposed lights as blacked out darkness is a clever move. Overall it is a good post apocalyptic movie experience if you keep yourself from analyzing as it goes along."
73567,Killer Joe,5.0,"On the one hand, Killer Joe does get better as it progresses, but on the other, it's also the first Friedkin movie I haven't loved.

Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole."
73723,The Lorax,4.0,"Just not for me. This _Lorax _is almost all filler. The message is still there, but it's lost under a tidal wave of meh.

_Final rating:★★ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._"
73723,The Lorax,1.0,Such a crap movie for babies. The Lorax is literal orange crap color. Boring garbage made by money hungry pigs.
73861,A Serbian Film,1.0,"Oh no, not another shock / exploitation film. It's just edgy trash that tries to traumatize the viewer. The movie has nothing new to offer that many other films have made with actual story included.

As the director said of the film ""modern-day colonialism via sexual exploitation of a poor country's human resource""."
73920,Dead Man's Letters,7.0,"Interesting an depressing movie with great staging.

In some ways, really similar to ""Threads""."
73952,When Strangers Appear,5.0,"Mitchell runs a desert (and deserted) diner and a rundown motel. Beat-up and terrified Watson wanders in, and by helping him, she riles up the people that are looking for him. Lucas and two sidekicks turn up and he initially acts friendly, especially when that nice doctor is hacked to death but perhaps he has an ulterior motive. Explosive ironical climax. Set in Texas but shot in New Zealand, this has a rugged look."
74024,Prey,3.0,"I will always, always, always give Australian genre films a chance, but Prey is pure trash.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
74121,Gaea Girls,7.0,"raw depiction of shifting cultural ideology in Japan. fascinating divulsion into the brutal world of female wrestling which i had no idea existed in Japan. Logninotto offers a stripped back view, never appearing in front of the camera nor providing voiceover - an immersive experience, placing us in the eyes and headspace of Longinotto as she wields the camera. following the journey of a newcomer, we root for the underdog. experiencing both top tier wrestling and training, we question the morality of wrestling in the 2000s which was more of an MMA crossover. not one to miss."
74208,Double or Nothing,8.0,"I honestly liked the supporting players here--especially the hilarious antics of Martha Raye and Andy Devine--a lot more than the frontman, Bing, here. I get it that he's so immensely talented that everything is effortless and he appears to be coasting. Maybe it's the way he had always put up the front of being nice, and such a great guy, yet was a nightmare to his own children, but he simply comes across as fake and phony, non-genuine. But for a 30's musical comedy coming out of Hollywood, it's pretty good, especially considering its budget."
74314,Bulldog Drummond's Secret Police,6.0,"Takes a while to get going - we seem to spend twenty minutes on an overly long in-joke about ""Drummond's"" ""(John Howard) oft-deferred wedding to ""Phyllis"" (Heather Angel) before we set off in search of a hidden treasure in an old house. It's a little reminiscent of ""Indiana Jones"" towards the end; loads of spikes and secret passages. EE Clive is great as the ever-reliable butler and Leo (Not ""G"" this time) Carroll proves to be more of a hindrance than a help! to our investigators."
74725,Kill List,8.0,"A bit tough to understand on the first watch, yet gripping and a compelling portrayal of inner demons.

But seriously, are the British the only film-makers who can make a decent crime/thriller film??"
74777,Absentia,7.0,"Pure filmmaking. Has the atmosphere that is by and large missing from the horror genre, opting for character development, tension, engagement and grounding rather than jump scares and gross-out gore effects. Still a horror movie, to be sure (and therefore not for everybody) but one that stands on its own.
_
Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._"
74842,Legend of the Millennium Dragon,3.0,Good animation but extremely weak story. Somehow a re-mix of many other better ones like Princess Mononoke.
74849,The Star Wars Holiday Special,1.0,"I recently spoke about how, in my opinion at least, _Attack of the Clones_ is the worst theatrically released _Star Wars_ of all time. The reason I had to put that ""theatrically released"" qualifier in there, is because of _The Holiday Special_, because it absolutely **blitzes** _Clones_ when it comes to how low it sinks. _The Holiday Special_ isn't just a bad _Star Wars_ movie, it isn't just a bad movie full stop, it basically isn't a movie at all. 

_Final rating:½ - So bad it’s offensive. I may never fully recover._"
74911,Step by Step,5.0,"Quite a far-fetched affair as Lawrence Tierney (rarely in the guise of a ""good guy"") bumps into Anne Jeffreys and together they get embroiled up in a Nazi plot in California. There's plenty of fisticuffs and pistol-whipping as Jeffreys discovers that her Senator boss is being spied upon - and they must stay ahead of pursuing Nazis and police alike. It does move along nippily for an hour, but the story is pretty predictable."
74914,8 Ball Bunny,9.0,"Viewed as an extra on my blu for 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'. Excellent--with a fine running joke, from the aforementioned film, of Bogart's character begging for money throughout the cartoon."
75174,The Grey,7.0,"I can't believe it took me so long to get around to watching _The Grey_.

What a ride. Don't know that it's realistic but damn it was good. Put me in that wolf pack. Would I be instantly dismembered? Sure, but you get that on the big jobs.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
75326,In Search of the Great Beast 666: Aleister Crowley,10.0,"Given the subject matter it could have been interesting and educational or absolute rubbish. Fortunately it went with interesting.

The big selling point is that the narration, at times, feels like a stage performance piece and is really just as earnest. So, honestly, the best part of the documentary is the delivery, and that makes for a fairly unique piece in any catalogue of documentaries."
75555,The Fear,5.0,"Weird enough to keep my attention but not much else works. The acting is, pardon the expression, wooden and characters pretty one-dimensional. At least the work done on 'Morty' was okay and the climax was... interesting, though didn't make a whole lot of sense. **2.5/5**"
75612,Oblivion,6.5,"Completely unoriginal plot, brings nothing new to the table. Good cinematography by Claudio Miranda, Tom Cruise is horrendous."
75612,Oblivion,2.5,This movie was a total waste! one of the weirdest movies. Not good at all would recommend you watch something better!
75612,Oblivion,7.0,"A bit of a corny movie with quite a simplistic resolution and soppy ending. But it's Tom Cruse, It's Sci-fi and it looks cool so what more do you need?"
75656,Now You See Me,4.0,Lot's of FX and no story. Flat characters and poorly told.
75656,Now You See Me,9.5,Best magical movie ever definitely my number two movie of all time number one being Armageddon.the four horsemen couldent have been played by better actors and actress.isla fisher is awesome.😃
75736,Catch.44,4.0,"Tries so desperately to emulate _Pulp Fiction_, that it's hard to say if _Catch .44_ would have been any good if it just tried to blaze its own trail. Seeing as it didn't, this is the movie we have: One that falls just short of ""Okay"".

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
75780,Jack Reacher,8.0,Good movie. Just like a normal type of Tom Cruise movie. Where he kicks lots of butte. In this one he's like a ghost. Trying to be like the bourne identity. Still a decent movie though.
76013,No Rest for the Wicked,6.0,"The film is engaging and has all the earmarks of being a great thriller, but some key element is missing and I can't put my finger on it."
76025,Shame,2.0,"Has a good reputation among critics and film-buffs, but I thought this was duller than dullsville on a dull tuesday.

Fassbender has got to be one of the most overrated actors in recent times. He's got a distinctive look and his eyes pierces through the screen I'll give him that. And a well-sized johnson (as proven on numorous ocassions here) but other than that he's fairly mediocre."
76122,Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant,5.0,"Serves functionally to reframe and thus correct an incongruity in _The Incredible Hulk_. That's all well and good, but it plays out so awkwardly that it almost wasn't worth it.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
76163,The Expendables 2,2.0,Jokes aren't funny. Scene logic is stupid. It´s a movie about guys with plastics in action!
76164,Bong of the Dead,3.0,"With a little more effort and a little more money, _Bong of the Dead_ could have been... Well still pretty bad. But certainly better. The ADR is unbearable, but otherwise I at least get what they were going for.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible_."
76170,The Wolverine,3.5,I am a big fan of The Volverine movies but this one didn't have to much in it! I even watch it again to see if I miss anything. I would say this is a good movie to watch when you have some free time not a MUST watch movie! still a good one at it!
76170,The Wolverine,7.0,"I was also a little disappointed. Especially the giant
samurai suite raised question marks. I wonder what will happen next since Wolverine's claws are cut off.

Dr. Green (alias Viper) reminds me of Poison Ivy (Batman). Somehow I didn't like that. Yukio, the red head, is cool tho."
76170,The Wolverine,5.0,Seeing Hugh Jackman as the wolverine is always a pleasure but this one is not thrilling at all. Just skip it unless you are a real fan.
76170,The Wolverine,7.0,"Pretty good film.

The Japanese setting really confused me, still kinda does, but I understand it somewhat now that I know the it was pulled from the comics. 

Good film overall, but similar to **_X-Men Origins: Wolverine_** it doesn't really seem to fit what fans want to see. 

Good movie though."
76203,12 Years a Slave,8.0,"This movie is very, very well done. Well, edited and with the proper long shots at the proper moments bringing you to the life of Solomon without remedy.

All the cast performs exceptionally well and Ejiofor is to be remembered for this film.

A must to be seen."
76203,12 Years a Slave,8.0,"Not in a long time have I seen a movie that brings out real emotions from my cold hearted soul. This movie brought them out in floods of tears.

the acting was superb, especially from the lead Chiwetel Ejiofor, he acted from his little toe right up to his eyes.

The style was also filmed beautifully with some (extremely) painful long shots which pulled you into Solomons nightmare.

Im not sure if its a film I could watch again, purely for the emotion but I would recommend this film to everyone."
76216,Helldriver,10.0,"For a genre that relies on pushing boundaries and having an original take on a template, Helldriver excels in all the above. It is not a movie to be taken seriously - it's a movie that takes you for a ride. A very gory and violent ride, but a very original and absolutely amazing one."
76338,Thor: The Dark World,6.0,"More of the same. Predecible non elaborated script and with a total lack of sense of humor.

The FX are, again, OK, but the feeling of swords, axes, armors and helmets is of cheap plastic."
76338,Thor: The Dark World,4.0,"Thor: The Dark World represents all of the MCU's worst tendencies: shoehorned humour at the expense of good scenes, a cookie cutter underdeveloped villain, and an over reliance on big outlandish explosions. It doesn't help that the story is also convoluted and lame, made even worse because it introduces the second infinity stone.

All in all, Thor: The Dark World is not a terrible movie. It's just far more cliché than its predecessors, and that's disappointing."
76341,Mad Max: Fury Road,7.0,"Good action movie with a decent script for the genre. The photography is really good too but, in the end, it is quite repeating itself from beginning to end and the stormy OST is exhausting."
76341,Mad Max: Fury Road,10.0,"I was never a fan of the original Mad Max films but this one just blew me away. There was something so powerfully visceral about this on the big screen. It was a fun on assault on the sense , in a good way. Its spectacle rather than plot driven so may not fare as well on the smaller screen. Watch on the largest possible tv in a darkened room with the phone and other gadgets off. Crank up the volume."
76403,DNA,4.0,"Everyone's all ""Oh I heard it was a bad _Predator_ ripoff, which is why I wanted to watch it, but I wasn't prepared, I hated it so much."" But like... That's exactly what it was. It's a bad _Predator_ ripoff. I wanted a bad _Predator_ ripoff, and I got one. Sure, it's a **very** bad one, but it **is** one, I don't understand the disappointment. 

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
76492,Hotel Transylvania,6.0,"The idea is clearly an evolution of what Shrek meant.

Other than that, the script and dialogues are not so brilliant. It was boring for a big deal of the time and there were too many things going on and too fast.

You can recognize Genndy Tartakovsky's style in the movie but I've liked other of his works much more than this."
76492,Hotel Transylvania,2.0,"Oh. This was... **super** underwhelming. Like I mean, I was prepared to appreciate it less than the majority of audiences, I often don't love kids' media, and I'm not really a fan of Adam Sandler, but I didn't think that I wouldn't find any appeal in it **at all**. This is just one I genuinely do not see what people are talking about when they give it a favourable review. 

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
76492,Hotel Transylvania,8.0,"Adam Sandler with another funny animated movie.. I dont even like animated movies, but his are good cause there very funny."
76535,Marvel One-Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer,6.0,"If we’re being honest with one another, it’s just an advertisement, and an advertisement that adds basically nothing to the MCU. But damn if it doesn’t put a smile on my face.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
76544,Man of Tai Chi,5.0,"The movie is not completely bad, but we have seen this trip a thousand times and it is not adding anything new. Reeve's direction is decent but it is not as good his villain acting."
76600,Avatar: The Way of Water,8.0,"No matter what you say about the story, you can't deny the fact that **James Cameron** managed to make eyes drool for 3hrs and 20mins. A movie that's meant to be watched on the biggest screen!."
76600,Avatar: The Way of Water,10.0,"I really enjoyed Avatar: The way of water! It's a great second part to Avatar, getting back into the fight, setting a new environment and it actually left me even more thinking, of how we just destroy our earth and how bad humans can get. It is a long movie, but I enjoyed it so much, I didn't care. So, I would really say: watch it, it is worth it, especially when you watch the first part before, to get back into the mood!"
76600,Avatar: The Way of Water,6.0,I rate this 6 out of 10. One of those points is for the special effects and another is because I watched it in 3D IMAX. That means that the rest of it was worth 4 stars. Not that it was actually that bad but the plot was thinner than the first one which wasn't particularly thick to start with. Entertaining enough but I wouldn't recommend it unless you see it in 3D IMAX in which case it's a fantastic feast for the senses. The fact that it didn't feel three hours must also a good sign.
76600,Avatar: The Way of Water,4.0,"Fluffy woke nonsense, minus anything that remotely resembles a story. That was my one and only impression of Avatar: The Way of Water. 

Dripping with simpering woke cliches, a missing in action script, the only compensation offered is enough special effects ""eye candy"", to give you diabetes.

In summary, vacuous fair, I simply couldn't watch till the end. At a stretch, it might have worked for children but the violence and overall treatment, doesn't lend itself to a more junior viewers."
76640,The Last Stand,8.0,"After a very long hiatus from the film industry, Arnie is back!

The Last Stand is a cheesy yet epic action movie in 2013. I recommend it as a guilty pleasure."
76696,Sidewalls,8.0,"In the category of romantic comedies, this film is creative and funny. And it is sooooooo adorable!"
76807,Sworn to Justice,6.0,Entertaining enough martial arts actioner with the wonderful Cynthia Rothrock showing off her skills... and other assets. Nothing amazing but the fight scenes were decent and it never felt dull. **3.25/5**
76812,Black Butterfly,6.0,"If it could have cut out the last two to three of the seven or so endings, then I could maybe have seen _Black_ _Butterfly_ getting a bigger score. As it stands, I can get it to fresh by the skin of its teeth.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._"
76851,Grand Slam,8.0,Entertaining heist-thriller with fine performances from all involved (would've liked seeing Edgar G. Robinson more but all in all was engrossed with the heist itself and the twist or two. Not sure if it ranks high amongst others in the genre (Ocean's Eleven is the top of my list) but still well worth checking out. **3.75/5**
77016,End of Watch,6.0,"A good duo at the forefront of this thing, but I don't especially care for the half-assed documentary schematic or, you know... cops.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a _"
77117,Sunny,8.0,"This is a fantastic film. It reminds me a lot of a Hamaguchi in that it is a women-centric story about relationships. But the resemblance ends there. This is an epic film about the survival and meaning of friendship that has humor, pathos, drama and even a touch of magic surrealism. If anything I've mentioned is up your alley, then don't pass on this one."
77165,And God Said to Cain,8.0,"Last one in the ""Vengeance Trails"" Arrow box set and probably the darkest one of the four. Really entertaining spaghetti western with more revenge, this one with Klaus Kinski as Gary Hamilton, coming back to town after being framed for a crime he didn't commit. Plot wise, not much different from what I've seen before, but the kills were pretty brutal (and can imagine especially so back in 1970) and never let up to the very end. **4.0/5**"
77234,The Numbers Station,3.0,A movie to forget with predictable plot and quite under the average performances from Cusack and Akerman.
77338,The Intouchables,9.0,Funny and moving for a difficult topic to talk about. François Cluzet and Omar Sy perform amazingly well although the rest of the cast is also very good.
77461,Where Do We Go Now?,7.0,"A nice drama-comedy. The idea is very good gut it's not well developed.

The cast is also good but the fails in story are what makes the movie not to work completely."
77495,Sleep Tight,9.0,Impressive performance by Marta Etura and Luis Tosar in this totally disturbing movie.
77495,Sleep Tight,7.0,"Great film, totally unpredictable from start to end, an absolute original, a must see."
77495,Sleep Tight,8.0,"<I>I can't be happy...</I>

Cesar goes through some measures to make others miserable. 
The movie overall was good in story and in pacing. The build up to the final 30 of this movie was great along with a twisted finale."
77616,Permanent Residence,3.0,"This is made by someone who doesn't understand what constitutes a good story or good acting. The directing is serviceable but when it's in service of such a bad script and such poor actors, so what? Even (especially?) the romantic and sex scenes are awkward. I appreciated the nudity."
77883,The Possession,4.0,"Does it's thing pretty fine, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan is perfectly capable, but God I am so over this exact formula cropping up in the genre over and over and over. _The Possession_ doesn't have a single thing that makes it noteworthy.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
77987,Only God Forgives,8.0,"A challenging piece of cinema. Definitely not for everyone. The cinematography is breathtaking, and the violence is stomach turning. 8/10"
78049,The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption,5.0,"Our stand in Scorpion King certainly does not have the presence of The Rock, but the franchise finally finds its place in the world: Being fucking ridiculous. I mean, what a cast! And those awful one-liners? Delivered with such enthusiasm, and after almost every strike! Incredible.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
78059,Call Me Mrs. Miracle,10.0,I really loved this movie.  Doris Roberts is one of my favorite actors.  It just pulled at your heartstrings.  It kept you on your toes on what might happen next.
78101,Many Wars Ago...,8.0,"A truly compelling anti-war film from Italy, which echoes Kubrick's earlier masterpiece Paths of Glory. Excellent performances and camera work communicate the message well: war is the most insane kind of hell indeed..."
78352,War Games: At the End of the Day,4.0,"Certainly not awful, but lacks the clarity required of it to be a truly good movie.

Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product."
78411,Dark Intruder,6.0,Okay feature short (that was a failed TV pilot) has its moments and fun seeing Leslie Nielsen before he became a comedic actor. Nothing great but watchable I suppose. **3.0/5**
79158,LEGO Star Wars: Bombad Bounty,6.0,"Dumb, but actually self-aware in an amusing way - which I respect.

<em>'LEGO Star Wars: Bombad Bounty'</em> is definitely the 'one to watch' out of all of these LEGO/Star Wars shorts. It isn't good, I'm not saying that, but it kinda entertained me for a few minutes; albeit in the most minimalist way possible.

...and I would fully be up to hearing an album from Yoda and the BoogieWookiees..."
79258,The House of Secrets,5.0,"Sadly, this is a remarkably derivative offering with two characters stumbling into a creepy old mansion filled with secret passages, a mad scientist, a damsel, and some medieval torture contraptions. Noel Madison just about makes the grade but the others are pretty C-grade, jobbing, actors given little by way of a script nor innovation to work with. I enjoyed watching it, it all creaks in all the right places - but suspect I will soon forget it completely."
79694,The Apparition,3.0,"Okay, so now fair warning, this is a minor-spoiler, but, I really wouldn't worry about that seeing as I'm going to preface it by recommending you don't watch _The Apparition_.

In the 3rd act, there are some pretty cool scenes were things like ends up spliced through walls and such. Those parts were actually semi-cool. Everything else about _The Apparition_ is a big, stupid, boring mess.

Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible."
79708,Pink Floyd: Behind the Wall,6.0,"Yes, this is more about the band and less about ""The Wall"" tour. Why it is described as a documentary about the behind-the-scenes making of the tour is a mystery.

Still, this is a pretty decent documentary about the beginnings of the band and the post-Waters era with a lot of footage from each decade."
79745,The Sleeping Voice,8.0,Good movie with impressive performances from Inma Cuesta and María León from Dulce Chacón great story about the life of the republican women after the end of the Spanish civil war and the starting of the dictatorship of the rebel general Franco.
79823,Schizoid,6.0,Satisfying and somewhat effective mystery-thriller. It's another 1980s-era movie that's not entirely special but kept my attention throughout. Also fun to see Christopher Lloyd in a film early in his career (though had been on Taxi for a couple years before this release). **3.25/5**
79934,The Clown,8.0,"This is an enjoyable film to watch - funny, a little touching, and with real characters. ""In this life, we have to do what we know how to. Cats drink milk, mice eat cheese... and I'm a clown."""
80047,Rowing with the Wind,6.0,"Looks like Lord Byron's castle was the location of Burning Man of the 19th century. A bit hard to follow, but a good biopic of the author of Frankenstein."
80577,Terror Out of the Sky,6.0,"As these sort of movies go, not half bad with some okay suspense and serviceable performances. This is my second made-for-TV creature (for the lack of a better word) killer following Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo. This one is not as slow going and although still not great, a fun enough time waster. **2.75/5**"
80638,The Glove,8.0,"The Glove (1979) is a very underrated John Saxon film about a broke bounty hunter who is desperate for money to pay off his alimony, so he takes up the job of finding Victor Hale, an ex-convict, despite the warnings of how dangerous he is. John Saxon gives the best acting performance I've seen from him, accompanied by a strong plot that kept my attention the whole way through. 4/5."
80785,Amazon Jail,4.0,Has some okay moments with very beautiful ladies but it does drag and the plot is clunky even by T&A standards. Thought the finale was fine but I wouldn't revisit this again. **1.75/5**
81185,The Amityville Haunting,2.0,"So this is it, the first ""Amityville"" part that doesn't belong to the official franchise. This terrible catastrophe of a movie is just another one of these damn low budget, soulless Found Footage atrocities, that should have wandered off right into the trash bin before someone had to see this. Thanks but no thanks, never ever again! One extra point for some titties, but that's the only good thing in this entire crap flick..."
81188,Rise of the Guardians,7.5,"Enjoying story inspired in 4 of the major ""legends"" for kids in the anglosaxon culture.

Great animation and development of characters for a simple and clean story with the needed touches of humor and action."
81188,Rise of the Guardians,9.0,"A delightful movie for children and families. Interesting twists on some of the figures of childhood, however, they are very likable characters. The Story is well thought out and pulls you in, I actually felt concerned that good would not triumph over evil. Great ending, but it kinda leaves you wanting more.  Another Dreamworks hit, sure to entertain the family."
81188,Rise of the Guardians,4.0,"Where were the owls again?

_Final rating:★★ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._"
81233,LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2,5.0,"An improvement on <em>'Lego Star Wars: Revenge of The Brick'</em>, as you'd expect four years on.

Once again, though, it all falls flat and is all too forgettable - not that I have any way of hating on it of course, given the run time of only 5mins. One thing that must be mentioned though - what the deuce (<em>shoutout Stewie</em>) did they do with Yoda?! Quite the piece of animation, that..."
81234,LEGO Star Wars: Revenge of The Brick,5.0,"Very poor attempt no doubt, but kinda worth it to see the decent end credits scene with Darth Vader.

To make <em>'Lego Star Wars: Revenge of The Brick'</em> with no dialogue was an interesting choice, one I actually didn't mind - helped by the ultra short 5 minute run time. The animation style, though, is horrific."
81390,A Lonely Place to Die,6.0,"A Lonely Place to Die is a thriller set in Scotland. A group of mountain climbers stumble upon a girl hidden underground by kidnappers in the middle of nowhere. They rescue her but not without the kidnappers tracking them down for the remainder of the movie.

The movie is quite violent with numerous homicides and has some very disturbing scenes such as a man unsuccessfully begging and pleading for his life and another death involving mountain climbing. The always charming Melissa George helps carry this movie but everyone plays their parts well. I give the movie a 6/10."
81470,The Guy from Harlem,1.0,"This film is so bad that it is hard to watch. If you must, watch with the Rifftrax track. It makes this movie enjoyable."
81471,Tintorera: Killer Shark,2.0,"All around boring sexploitation film that isn't all that sleazy (though plenty of nudity, but everything was rather tame) though I guess props to some of the underwater photography and gore effects when the Jaws portion of the film, which only makes up maybe 10% of the film, is on-screen. Did make me sqeamish seeing real life fish and sharks being killed for a film like this.

From what I read, there is apparently a two-hour version, I cannot imagine sitting through that, 87-minutes was a tough sit for me. Frankly there's very little redeeming. **1.25/5**"
82036,The Bohemian Girl,8.0,"A solid full-length work by Laurel and Hardy that just may be a tad too sophisticated for their audience at the time. It still works, mainly due to an excellent supporting cast and the hilarity of seeing Stan pretend he's drunk, trying to siphon wine into bottles."
82390,The Paperboy,6.0,"Hugely disturbing. Performances and direction are quite good, IMHO, just the story is creepy and disgusting."
82394,Swiss Miss,8.0,"Some really fine comedic set-pieces to see here, though studio ideas to both pad the length with silly musical numbers and broaden their prospective audience (and thus coffers) with romance and the aforementioned songs weren't the brightest in the world. Still a good comedy that's essential watching for fans of both the duo and of that era of comedy in general."
82474,7th Heaven,8.0,I loved this movie. Great acting and chemistry from Gaynor and Farrell. The plot had genuine tension and joy.
82507,Sinister,6.0,"Hits an absurdly high number of horror clichés, but manages to do it in a pretty successful manner. Features many more laugh out moments than you might expect from a horror of this type. Not sure if that's a pro or a con.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
82654,Warm Bodies,7.0,"If you like zombie's gener you will love this movie ... or not!

It cheats in a cheap way through creating 2 level of zombies: the good ones and the bad ones. Also, it breaks tons of zombies stereotypes to be able to build the story, that's why you may end hating it if you are a ""purist"".

As this is not my case, I really enjoyed this movie. Fun script, good casting and great performances by Hoult and Palmer. Also, always a pleasure to watch a movie with John Malkovich."
82655,The Oregonian,4.0,"I can get behind the avant-garde levels of hardline surrealism, but what I am not on board with is the deliberately awful levels of sound quality. It's painful to listen to, and that's not what I'm about.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
82675,Taken 2,7.5,"Taken 2 was... Not as good as the first one. Yes, I am sad to say it is not as good but on the other hand the story is still sound and the action is better and faster then before. Liam Neeson plays his role excellently while some on the other cast members didn't preform as well. All in all a good movie but there are some little problems, but worth seeing any way."
82675,Taken 2,5.0,"The _Die Hard 3_ of the _Taken_ franchise, except like... Nowhere near as good. Serviceable, but a step down from the first film, and even that one was pretty overrated.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
82687,The Guilt Trip,8.0,"This is a very pleasant comedy indeed.

The laughs are at just the right density.

It may be about a Jewish Mother and her grown son, but that is never evident; which is wise, as the humor is universal.

The ""chemistry"" between Babs and Seth approaches extraordinary. They are very believable as an adult son and an adoring mother adept at piling on guilt with a steam shovel."
82690,Wreck-It Ralph,8.5,"Wreck-It Ralph is a great movie with my love for games in there with it. The movie had some great childhood memories of mine, with all the characters from the best games. The graphics are excellent and the voice acting couldn't be better. This movie is great for adults and kids."
82690,Wreck-It Ralph,7.0,Surely the thematic is great and it is funny to see old pals from several video games but Wreck-it Ralph lacks the hook of most of Disney movies.
82700,After Earth,4.0,Decent movie. Nothing like dad giving you a lead role. There should have been more fighting in the movie instead of seeing him struggle so much.
82703,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8.0,"I'm not a big fan of the loser-hero, boy-centric themes in this one, however the animation and sound is high quality and worth the watch."
83540,Dreams of a Life,10.0,"One of the saddest stories you are bound to see.  A woman dies in her flat, but her body isn't discovered until more than two years later. There's more questions than answers about Joyce Vincent (played by Zawe Ashton), but it's hard not to be taken in by the material. So the next time that a friend or a family member calls to check on you for the umpteenth time, be grateful rather than annoyed."
83542,Cloud Atlas,7.0,"Interesting film with an exceptional cast, fantastic performances and characterizations. The story, though, is a bit difficult to follow and, in the end, seems to not have a real point."
83542,Cloud Atlas,6.0,"A not-easy-to-follow film, we are presented with sub-plots from several times and places, both past and future - in which the same characters seem to be involved.

An interesting idea, good images but yu need to have a particular taste in movies in order to fully enjoy Cloud Atlas. I feel that the average audience may not be heavily impressed with they way it conveys its message - by going from one timeline to another and slowly building up all these sub-plots in parallel."
83676,A Tale of Two Kitties,6.0,"""Babbit"" and ""Costello"" try just about everything to catch ""Tweety Pie"" who is safely ensconced in his nest atop a tall tree. Dynamite, stilts, springs, water pistols and just about everything else are in their armoury but it doesn't look good for the ""poor puddy cat"". An anvil and a pitch fork ... ouch!"
83821,Trapped Alive,6.0,"Some okay moments, along with the beautiful Sullivan Hester (in her one and only role), but pretty forgettable."
83860,October Baby,10.0,"Hate the sin, not the sinner. Passing judgment is not an appropriate choice, but the child you choose to abort today could turn out to be so much more than the inconvenience you might have to go through. Awesome cast with believable results, great storyboard. Highly recommended for everyone, especially for anyone struggling with life changing decisions.  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
83880,Super Shark,3.0,"See that tank on the front cover? It's a walking tank. That's not a spoiler you literally see that in the opening scene (a flash forward), so why would they not make use of that fact as promotional material? I guess, because, like the entire movie itself, its super dumb.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
83896,Sand Sharks,2.0,"The Sand Sharks themselves have an at least slightly interesting design, but the movie they are named for is woeful. There was almost some humour at a couple of points, but this, just like everything else in _Sand Sharks_, falls flat.

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs_"
83899,You're Next,8.0,"Stereotypes exist for a reason. Without them, You're Next would have very little to work with. Luckily the film uses what would be eye-rolling moments and turns them on their heads. It had a rather nestalgic feel, while feeling fresh at the same time. Solid effects and passable acting makes this a must for any genre fan."
84174,Bachelorette,1.0,"Horrible movie!!!
It is one of the least funny comedies I've seen in my life. The dirty language is not helping at all and it seams they use only to make the movie look cool or to shock the audience and it feels like that - very unnatural."
84178,Black Rock,5.0,"Not very original, but, very powerful. At least, very powerful for a genre debut starring Kate Bosworth.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
84188,Compliance,7.0,"Creepy, uncomfortable and unnerving for sure, the subject is a bit of a stretch in feature film length and probably better suited as some sort of episode on ID, analyzing the psychology of these incidents. Still, the performances by Ann Dowd and Dreama Walker were both quite good. **3.25/5**"
84204,Grabbers,4.0,"A funny set on stage with a polished photography and FX which should be working great but that lacks the smart dialogues to make a good experience out of it.

Just boring."
84209,Busting,6.0,"Some interesting visuals, a decent (if not funny) ambulance chase sequence at the end, and strong performance from Elliott Gould, but the script is weak and is a forgettable 1970s crime-drama. **3.0/5**"
84226,The Day,5.0,"Weird to have a cast where there is a single big name amongst the lot, but there also isn't a single person you don't know from something else. _The Day_ was not as good as I had hoped it might be from the description, but better than I had expected after the first couple of minutes.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
84228,Julia X,4.0,"Poor form acting, subpar stunts and some God awful (not to mention completely unnecessary) CGI, but I did have a great time laughing at the subtitle errors.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
84330,Room 237,6.0,This is a pretentious film with assertions that are way out in left field. The reason I gave it this score is my love for the original movie itself.
84334,Searching for Sugar Man,6.0,"An interesting story in a well driven story and high quality cut.

However, it tries to be much more epic than what it actually is."
84334,Searching for Sugar Man,8.0,"An unlikely and interesting story that is part historical, part investigation and ultimately satisfying. The historical backdrop of South Africa's dictatorship years and of the lack of communication it had with the outside world are key in understanding why this strange story could happen in the first place."
84577,7 Below,2.0,"Luke Goss, you gotta stop putting me through crap like this man, please just be in another good movie!

_7 Below_ is bad, and it's the kind of bad that really can't be excused or overlooked. The awful sound mixing alone would disqualify it from being any sort of worthwhile, but that is merely where _7 Below's_ problems begin, not where they end. Please do yourself the favour of avoiding this movie like the plague.

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"
84708,Captive Wild Woman,5.0,"Middling 1940s horror movie with John Carradine playing a mad scientist converting an ape into a woman. Could've made for a cheesy entertaining film that I couldn't enjoy with the clear animal abuse; fine for the times I know, but was at times hard to watch. **2.5/5**"
84892,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,8.0,"Really complex and sweet movie with a great story, script and performances from Lerman, Watson and Miller.

Also, great directing and cut. A really good movie for a rainy day."
84892,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,10.0,This movie was godly. No other like it. Truly a spiritual experience.
84892,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,10.0,"This movie & book honest to god changed my life. I also feel that they supplement each other well. The movie includes details not included in the book and vice versa. Read the book and then watch the movie, its a spiritual experience."
85001,Blood Tracks,3.0,"Pretty lackluster indie horror film with shoddy acting though some of the gore effects were okay I guess. Heavy influence from The Hills Have Eyes as well, just set in a snowy environment instead of the desert. Watchable but just a bad B-movie, but I wonder if it'd be entertaining in a group setting. **1.75/5**"
85087,Dreams of Dust,7.0,"Powerful if brutal film about shame,guilt and redemption. Even when one has lost everything and has nothing. Great cinematography."
85110,Dog Star Man: Part I,8.0,"I adored this, quite reasonably regarded as one of the finest post-silent short experimental works. Confused why it's regarded as five separate films, though.

Seen on my university library's Criterion Collection DVD of Brakhage's anthology, Volume 1. I certainly hope to purchase for my own collection the blu release of Volumes 1 and 2."
85148,Terror at Tenkiller,3.0,"Sleep-inducing horror-thriller that lacks any mystery since the killer's identity is shown in the opening scene. Some okay gore effects at least given the budget. Still, even though it's only 88-minutes, feels so much longer as the bulk of the film was filled with boring dialogue and bad acting. **1.75/5**"
85194,Deadly Games,3.0,"Starts off well enough with decent suspense and kill (not to mention gratuitous nudity in a day for night shot no less) but the rest of the film was pretty boring, not to mention some annoying characters and bad acting. Despite being fairly short, I found most of this to be rather dull and a twist that wasn't very effective. No wonder this early 80s slasher had been forgotten. **1.25/5**"
85199,Death Screams,4.0,"Low budget and rather dull 1980s-slasher where 60-70% was filler and a sequence that Red Letter Media would call ""shooting the radio"" where we spend a chunk of time at a county fair. None of the characters are memorable but at least the last 15 minutes had a silly fun vibe, just not nearly enough to make this at all entertaining. **2.0/5**"
85207,Airborne,4.0,"I'll watch anything that provides me with a little Craig Conway, but _Airborne_ never elevates itself above the micro-budget Brit horror movie that it is. The acting is certainly not quite so bad as might expect, but the film overall is still not something worthwhile by-and-large.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
85435,A Few Best Men,1.0,"Wretched comedy about English boy preparing to marry an Aussie girl. His pals make the journey Down Under to proceed to make the wedding into a disaster. Crude jokes and situations, often involving a ram. Debicki’s debut and Wilson’s second film. Newton-John looks false and enjoys cocaine."
85595,Account Rendered,6.0,"This is quite a gripping little crime B-feature. When a rather odious woman is murdered, there is no lack of suspects for Ewen Solon (""Insp. Marshall"") to investigate. It could be the husband, the lover, the artist - or just about anyone. Griffith Jones (""Ainsworth"") and Honor Blackman (""Sarah"") help this tightly paced/scripted drama move along a-pace with just enough suspense to keep it interesting for just under an hour with quite an exciting conclusion in the dark with some noisy steam trains raising the tension nicely."
85889,Filth,7.0,"A movie with a difficult story and interesting plot. A gift for the cast and a McAvoy who performs great.

Don't watch it if you don't have a deep skin and tons of sense of humor since it is quite disturbing but enjoyable at times ...

Quite an example of the humor in UK but not just that ..."
86001,Pain,7.0,I felt bipolar with this movie. It will make you laugh and cry.  The script is not amazing and the story is very simple. Not pretentious at all but it really touched me.
86251,Strike Commando,5.0,"Rip-off (or if being kind, homage) of Rambo has some hilariously bad moments and while parts were a slog to get through, but I had some fun watching especially the over-the-top acting and action (get a chuckle every time a grenade is thrown, baddies would fly back several feet even though the explosion was nowhere near them). The lead, Reb Brown, doesn't have a whole lot of charisma but fine for this kind of material. **2.5/5**"
86254,Crash Landing,4.0,"It's story isn't bad (although it's full of clichés) and it does have some likable characters but it's budget, script, and acting (in particular Brianne Davis) are all pretty awful."
86302,A Lovely Way to Die,4.0,"This comedic-thriller is neither funny nor very suspense-filled. The dialogue is stilted and characters not entirely likable, but worse it's just all around dull, uninteresting and forgettable. By the end my mind was drifting off elsewhere. **2.0/5**"
86326,Phantom of the Mall: Eric's Revenge,5.0,"Has a couple moments and decent kills, especially during the finale, but otherwise pretty bland 1980s horror take of Phantom of the Opera. I did like the lead (Kari Whitman) well enough (though thought her friend, played by Kimer Sissons was cuter) and can't say I was terribly bored, yet doubt I have any interest revisiting. Kind of blends in with most of the horror films that came out of the 80s. **2.5/5**"
86515,Savage Sisters,5.0,"Watchable but kind of bland 1970s action flick featuring 3 cute leading ladies who were mostly unremarkable in terms of screen presence. Parts had okay action but I found stretches that were pretty lackluster, even dull. On the plus side, Sid Haig was having a good old time so he was a lot of fun whenever on screen. **2.75/5**"
86682,They Call Me Macho Woman,5.0,"Watchable but also repetitive horror-thriller finds our heroine running, getting captured by drug dealers, escaping, captured once again and escaping, and yet again captured before escaping one last time. This goes on for a good hour of an already short movie. The last 15-minutes or so was entertaining enough but the rest is a bit of a chore to sit through. The whole premise makes no sense as to why they wanted to keep her alive. Debra Sweaney was attractive at least. **2.25/5**"
86726,Under the Boardwalk: The Monopoly Story,10.0,"This film should appeal to everyone. For history buffs, the largely unknown but amazing early history of Monopoly is uncovered. For gamer types, the latest round of national championships around the world and the World Championship in Las Vegas add the right amount of suspense. For pop culturists, the game's many icons and famous sayings are surveyed through great movie and tv show clips. And for those wanting to win when they play Monopoly, the included strategy tips are sure to help. Seems like great fun for everybody!"
86786,Action U.S.A.,6.0,"Outside of some fun pyrotechnics (explosions), this is a pretty bland action movie with no real chemistry between the three main actors. Seems like this was going for a Lethal Weapon vibe (which was released two years prior in 1987), but never reaches that level, not even close. I guess has some bad-good moments but I was fairly bored through much of this. **2.75/5**"
86812,Sound of My Voice,10.0,"Excellent movie. It's very interesting. Doesn't have any dull moments. Creates something unique atmosphere. After watching it, I had a desire to watch it again. All Actors are playing well their roles, characters aren't boring. Ending is surprisingly interesting. I think it became one of my favorite movies of all time & I admit, I love well-made indie movies like this. And definitely I'm recommending this movie for the people who seek movies about cults, people's life & mystery, instead of special effects & etc."
86828,Absolutely Anything,4.0,"A better cast, worst scripted _Bruce Almighty_. The execution is severely lacking, and as much as I adore seeing Simon Pegg and Kate Beckinsale ham up the screen, it seems obvious how much better this could (and should) have gone. What we are left with in _Absolutely Anything_ is a movie that was engaging, yet glaringly bad, the sort of thing I didn't hate watching, but will never watch again.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
86837,Amour,8.0,"Superb drama about the final stage of the life of a middle-high class couple in France when one of them gets disabled due to a stroke.

Bothe actors perform exceptionally."
86889,Dracula,10.0,"There was no shortage of vampire movies in the early 1970s, so it's
understandable how this gem became a bit lost in the shuffle. In this
sadly underrated version, Jack Palance's interpretation of the Count is
both powerful and frightening under the skilled direction of Dan Curtis.
A great script from legendary horror / sci-fi veteran Richard Matheson
adds much to the value as well. The film has solid production values
and a standout performance from Nigel Davenport as Van Helsing."
86955,Body and Soul,8.0,"I love silent films, though this one heralding the first film performance of Paul Robeson is simply good or decent, not great or essential. Robeson's performance is excellent in an otherwise average melodrama, and it's clear he's going to be a star of the silver screen. In her only cinematic appearance, Julia Theresa Russell, who was the director's sister-in-law, deserves mention, however. She's gorgeous and her acting wasn't bad at all. The jazz/blues/spiritual score on the Criterion Collection release, I believe by Wycliffe Gordon, is outstanding. Recommended if you like either silent films or Paul Robeson."
87421,Riddick,8.0,"The third Pitch Black film ""Riddick"" is much more focused than its predecessor and a welcome return to the formula that worked so well for the original movie. Riddick is a bad-ass survivalist fighting an extinction level event that threatens everybody, with an assembly cast that is colorful and fun to watch."
87502,Flight,8.0,"With Robert Zemekis at the helm, it has to be good, right?

Pretty much. Not the strongest performance by Cheadle, but otherwise the cast is great. John Goodman is a welcome surprise half-way through and really brings this home.

With a feel good ending, what more do you 1-3 star people want??

It's Denzel!!"
87827,Life of Pi,9.0,"Visually, this movie traps yourself from the beginning to the end.

The story is really deep and moving and the performances are plainly good.

A must to be seen."
87827,Life of Pi,9.0,"Perfectly written, amazingly filmed, and surprisingly ended. Definitely, going in my amnisa list."
87874,Werewolf,3.0,"Just... Just unapologetically awful from start to finish. But has one of the best reasons for a person to become a werewolf ever put to screen: The bloke gets absolutely brained by a werewolf skull in the first act.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
88174,Whispers in the Dark,6.0,"Some okay moments and the acting from Annabella Sciorra was pretty good, though the ending has a couple unintentionally funny parts, one with the killer just blurting out a confession (sure, he was cornered with Sciorra's character discovering his feelings for her, but was just odd and felt lazy), followed by him expositioning all the things he did throughout the film. Still, as 1990s erotic thrillers go, it's watchable. **3.0/5**"
88273,A Royal Affair,8.0,"Based on a true story, this is a phenomenal period piece with first-class photography, directing and acting. You can't ask much more of any film. Pure, historical entertainment."
88947,A Stranger in Town,7.0,"Tony Anthony as The Stranger in an above average spaghetti. Frank Wolff as Aguilar was best behind a machine gun. Some good scenes Great ending. So little dialogue, the music seems almost non-stop as a filler. The main theme is OK, parts of the 'score' are truly crap and distracts from enjoying the film to an extent."
89125,Alley Cat,5.0,"Oddly paced revenge thriller has a couple okay fight scenes from the lovely Karin Mani but there's no real stand-out moments and as a whole, pretty forgettable. **2.75/5**"
89455,360,4.0,"Somehow boring movie of crossing lives. Fernando Meirelles is not as successful as with City of God. This movie looks like bad a remix from Iñarritu's and Arriaga's ""Amores perros"", ""21 grams"" or ""Babel""."
89652,Colt 38 Special Squad,6.0,"A bit slow at times and a pretty basic plot, but this Italian crime-thriller has its moments and I liked the lead well enough to keep following, but nothing really memorable. **3.0/5**"
89720,Kiss of the Tarantula,4.0,In a nutshell - a girl in a backwater American town uses her deadly pets - tarantulas - as her instrument of vengeance on any who piss her off. That includes just about everyone except dear old dad (who makes/sells coffins!). It's pretty variable drive-in fayre though the ending did inject a tiny bit of suspense for a few minutes.
89921,White Fire,4.0,"While there were a few good bad moments early on, the rest was either really dull or downright creepy with an incestuous relationship between Bo Donnelly (Robert Ginty) and Olga who gets plastic surgery to look like his sister who was killed, and the pair have some sort of romance going. Beyond that, the plot gets really muddled by the finale to the point I had no idea, nor had much interest, with what was happening. **2.0/5**"
90015,Bandidos,8.0,"Really good western with solid performances, but it's the direction from Massimo Dallamano (DP on A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More) was top notch and some great angles and perspectives. So far in the ""Vengeance Trails"" set, this is my favorite. **4.0/5**"
90110,Down and Dirty Duck,8.5,"I only recently saw this great film on DVD and I must say, its one of the best films of its kind! We follow Willard, an insurance adjuster who finds himself on one crazy adventure after another with one crazy duck. The music is great, the jokes (while dated) are very funny,and while the animation quality may not be as good as many of Ralph Bakshi's films, I found this far more entertaining than Fritz the Cat. Its a must see for those who love the more twisted films of the 70's."
91550,Violet & Daisy,8.0,SAIRSE RONANA AND ALEXI BLEDEL OWN THE SCREEN AND THOSE WHO HAVE DONE THEM WRONG.  THE SCRIPT IS A TAD BIT WEAK. THE ACTOR WITH THE HATCHET FACE WAS AMAZINGLY CREEPY.  GOOD WATCH IF YOUR INTO FEMALE ASSASSIN FILMS.
91586,Insidious: Chapter 2,5.0,"A decent enough movie I suppose, and an interesting sequel, but pales in comparison to the first.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
92182,Silent House,3.0,"Called 95% of the ending within the first 5 minutes, and boy did I hate that camera work. But I managed to make it through the 87 minute runtime more or less unscathed, mostly thanks to lead peformer Elizabeth Olsen.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
92233,The Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion,7.0,"Just has enough about it.

<em>'The Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion'</em> includes good performances from Dagmar Lassander, Pier Paolo Capponi, Simón Andreu and Nieves Navarro. It's also paced well enough, despite a few slower moments, and has a solid ending. The film is also short at around 90mins and features a neat score from a certain Ennio Morricone."
92682,Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon,6.0,"Good watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.

I can't believe it took 3 movies to get back to being relatively charming again.

We get the triplet shuffle this time, dealing with the girls' dates in a positive fashion, we get twin shuffling, and the plot of ""we inherited a tiny Hawaiian hotel"" is one that I want to see again!

It's not a great movie by far, but it was fun."
92694,Hell's Trap,4.0,"Not so much bad but just all around dull. On the plus side, some of the gore effects were okay and a nice little explosion in there but I found my mind wandering a few times. **2.25/5**"
92725,The Naked Witch,2.0,"The first eight and a half minutes are consumed by a detailed examination of at least one painting by Hieronymus Bosch.

The remaining 51 minutes are consumed by a really, really awful movie.  This movie is so bad that it wraps around through good and into mediocre.  The titular Naked Witch never appears more than topless and what passes for acting in this movie is similarly underwhelming."
92750,David and Goliath,7.0,"This was interesting, and I watched it only because I both love swords-and-sandals epics and am a huge Orson Welles fan. This gets huge bonus points because only Welles would insist on making sure he got to direct every scene that he acted in. That's awesome--and craftsmanship and artistry such as his should never be denied, simply for the sake of cinema."
94134,The Man from Toronto,7.0,"One of the earliest adorable romantic comedies with UK's Jessie Matthews. Who was already bubbly, but had yet to stumble across the musical formula which would produce her best films like Evergreen (1934), First a Girl (1935), It's Love Again (1936) and Sailing Along (1938). Still very enjoyable in all it's predictability thanks to this sweet gal."
94329,The Raid,7.0,"Oh, good, the plot, the dialogues and the performances of the characters are plainly terrible.

Other than that, if you are looking for an action movie with tons of ""dancing"" fights, this is your movie."
94329,The Raid,8.0,"Despite being an early entry, _The Raid_ is arguably the most revolutionary action movie of the past decade. And the decade is almost over. Iko Uwais is clear talent when it comes to this sort of stunt work, and with the exception of a little too much shakey-cam near the start, you get a really look at him (and the rest of the cast) doing their thing, a lesson which the majority of Hollywood action movies nowadays apparently needs to re-learn.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
94348,Alex Cross,6.0,"Not bad, thought it was going to be a lot worse. It was ok."
94363,Hick,6.0,"**Spoiler Alert!**

I didn't like the story, not that it was bad, I just don't like when children are prey for pedophiles, which occurs in this story.  Luli wants a baby brother and instead, her parents leave her almost all the guys in the movie start sexually assaulting her, and to make matters worse she starts to be manipulated by a psychopath who is also a pedophile.  Actors, music, and others good."
94603,Strippers vs. Werewolves,4.0,"Not a great film, but certainly satisfies the blood & tits quotient.

Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product."
94741,The Don Is Dead,7.0,"Unambitious but still entertaining enough mafia crime-drama featuring pretty good performances, for the most part anyway, that likely came about due to the success of The Godfather, released a year prior (I assume many studios were buying up rights to other mafia-based novels). Anthony Quinn is quite good, as is Robert Forster save for a scene upon hearing about the death of his father, there the emotion felt hollow. But otherwise, it's a passable crime-drama worth checking out. **3.25/5**"
94752,The Doll Squad,4.0,Pretty boring action-thriller that has a few fun good-bad moments but as a whole I was disengaged with the whole thing. Only thing that had me interested was finding out this possibly was the inspiration behind Charlie's Angels. Not one I'll ever revisit. **2.0/5**
94901,About Cherry,3.0,"An OK script that is marred by bad acting and completely lackluster camera work. I feel like I need to blame James Franco yet again. Yes, I think I will.

""It is entirely James Franco's fault that this movie sucks."""
94935,Deool,10.0,"So daring excellent take on cultural values in globalized economy like India, satire at its best."
95415,Anarchy TV,10.0,"Hilarious social satire that skewers American media and politics. It's over-the-top and in your face and definitely not for the easily offended, but if you like wacky political satire, this is for you."
95516,Cleanskin,4.0,"It's a format I've seen before in British crime thriller/political intrigue films, a format I'm not particularly fond of, and _Cleanskin_ isn't even a well done example of it. No letdowns in the acting department though, so credit where credit's due.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
96133,Vengeance,6.0,"OK spaghetti western. Could and should have been better. Great opening scene, some nice spaghetti elements held down by a lousy score and a lead with no presence who doesn't resemble in the least a 'half-breed'. Camaso is good but you have to wait for him."
96724,Anna Karenina,8.0,"The stylistic use of the stage drifted between excessive and under-utilised, occasionally falling into perfect balance, of which the ballroom dance scene between Kitty, Vronsky and Anna Karenina is the prime example.

The film tells its story closer to the way a ballet’s is told."
97020,RoboCop,4.0,"Decent remake with well done FX and with quite an impressive cast that keeps a proper level... but flat.

No only it doesn't contribute anything new to the prior movie but also lacks on humor and deeper psychological insight."
97107,The Land Has Eyes,7.0,"A fairly solid movie.

I got the required amount out of <em>'The Land Has Eyes'</em>. Sapeta Taito leads a decent cast nicely, portraying a story that holds suitable intrigue and drama - it gets hearty at one particularly moment too. Of course it isn't a perfect movie, the pacing for one could've been slightly improved, but for what it is I had a pleasant enough time with it.

Cool seeing the visuals of Rotuma, a dependency of Fiji, on the silver screen. Hopefully there'll be more in the future."
97340,Black's Game,5.0,"A template gangster movie that with little adaptation could be set anywhere in Europe in the last thirty years or so. Satisfies an urgent need for action and is easily forgotten after. The story is as predictable as can be and characters fill their cut out roles. Worth mentioning is the well performed, although one dimensional, crime lord Bruno by Damon Younger. Not a bad movie for its genre but also nothing special."
97365,Rust and Bone,9.0,"Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts stun in this exceptional drama/romance. 

Driven by intense inner demons, Schoenaerts destroys everything around him, only to build it back up in a gripping climax that nearly had me in tears. 

This was amazing. I have loved everything that I've seen Schoenaerts in and I look forward to exploring more."
97370,Under the Skin,6.0,"Johansson makes a great performance in an unlikely role, adding great sensuality to the film, even with her very different looking.

The story and movie on itself is a rarety. Very fresh but, also, kind of an unfinished joke."
97554,The Sleeping Cardinal,6.0,Watchable mystery-drama with Arthur Wontner and Ian Fleming as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson respectively. A bit slow at times but I still was engaged enough with the mystery element and liked Wontner's portrayal of the classic character. **3.25/5**
97630,Zero Dark Thirty,5.0,Quite a flat movie. The story is interesting and also the fact that it shows how US has used tortures (which everybody but some US citizens already knew) but not much more than that.
98238,The White Meadows,8.0,"Stunning imagery. Whether interpreted as allegory or Kafkaesque nightmare, this is a prime example of the upper tier in art film. The end seemed somewhat out of place after the mesmerizing journeys through Lake Urmia in northwestern Iran. The director and others were jailed for making it. This film warrants multiple viewings."
99099,Shogun's Joy of Torture,6.0,"Not quite sure what to make of this. It is my first foray into the ""pinky violent"" subgenre. Supposedly the three stories were partially based on documentation of real stories and each one is pretty bizarre and while not very good, can't say it's bad either, just doesn't have much substance other than men's desire to torture I guess. **3.0/5**"
99186,"Joe Bonamassa - Beacon Theatre, Live from New York",9.5,"Features guest appearances by Paul Rodgers, John Hiatt and Beth Hart. Hart joins Bonamassa for “I’ll Take Care of You” and “Sinner’s Prayer” from their album 2011 album Don't Explain album. Rodgers and Bonamassa perform “Fire And Water” and “Walk in My Shadows”"
99373,GetEven,6.0,"That was... something. This is a vanity project from John De Hart who has zero charisma as an actor and no idea how to direct. Among the hilarious bad scenes, there were some long ones that were uncomfortable (to the point I fast forward through them). The acting from everyone else was awful, though Wings Hauser was fun to watch; seemed like he was drunk and/or high during his scenes. On the technical front, the sound design is terrible with some dialogue indiscernible thanks to being drowned out by the  cheesy songs. **3.0/5**"
99861,Avengers: Age of Ultron,6.5,There is a lot going on in this movie but it all just seemed kind of pointless and dull to me. Every now and then there would be a good scene or piece of dialogue but for the most part I felt myself getting bored and reaching for my phone to play Cribbage. I guess what I didn't like most is that it all felt like a big filler episode instead of an action packed character driven story arc.
99861,Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.0,"Action, good Fx and a ""not-completely-absurd"" story. The actors perform well and you can identify them very well with their characters ... but it is all old and without imagination.

I suppose nobody was expecting anything else, though ..."
100042,Dumb and Dumber To,7.0,Better then the original I think. Was pretty funny. I thought the comedy was better then the original too.
100270,Game of Werewolves,7.0,Much more a comedy than a horror movie. Lots of laughs and a good cast. Much better if you can understand all the unspoken Spanish jokes.
100323,Pigs in a Polka,6.0,"Amusingly set to Brahm's ""Hungarian Dances"" we see the three little pigs build their houses of straw; of wood (well, matches!) and of brick before the ""Big Bad Wolf"" arrives, in his best ""Taras Bulba"" style, to lure the little piggies to their doom. The rest pretty much follows the fairy tale and is quickly paced and fun to watch as he huffs and puffs (and is given some mouthwash) - but can he outsmart the pigs and get into the brick house?"
100334,Porky Pig's Feat,7.0,"""Daffy"" and ""Porky"" find themselves stuck in the ""Broken Arms"" hotel unable leave until they pay their enormous bill. Try as they might, the manager just isn't going to let them leave... ""Daffy"" (he's as black as a sheet!) is on great form here, with plenty of quickly paced humour and as their nemesis gets more frustrated, the antics get more desperate. They even take a trick out of Rapunzel's book at one point - but will any of their cunning wheezes get them out of there, or will they have to send for ""Bugs""? Good fun!"
100402,Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.0,"Put *a little* bit of brain in a superhero's movie script and you will have everybody talking wonders about it.

This is not a bad movie but neither astonishing. Fun and entertaining and with great FX, as expected."
100402,Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.0,"Not as good as the first. Still a good movie though. The only thing I don't like is, he's suppose to be Captain America. With all these super powers. So why does he need help all time."
100493,The Devil's Carnival,8.0,"The make up is pretty sweet and each story is a folklore/fable to the 3 characters sent to the carnival.

Honestly the music is pretty good. I would honestly volunteer to be a part of this carnival. I don't have a great singing voice but it'll still be fun.

This movie is pretty short, 55 minutes, but it gives you some great songs and imagery of a hellish carnival. If you like musical horror like <I>Repo! The Genetic Opera (2006) and Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)</I> then this might be up your alley."
101299,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,4.0,"More of the same stuff.

Lawrence is not bad and I think Josh Hutcherson is a great discovering but that's mostly it."
101509,Case of the Missing Hare,6.0,"A travelling magician decides to nail his poster to the side of a tree - but that happens to be the door to ""Bugs'"" house. The magician makes the mistake of calling him a ""dumb bunny"" and so, of course - it's war, with the magician's show (and prestidigitation) the subject of sabotage - ""Bugs"" style! The narrative makes good use of magic circle style trickery and by the end I actually felt a bit sorry for the poor, befuddled, illusionist and he is hamstrung at every turn!"
101519,A Fantastic Fear of Everything,6.0,"It all hinges on Simon Pegg, and for me, he makes it work. _A Fantastic Fear of Everything_ will not be for everyone, indeed, it's darker than even your average horror comedy, but I am happy to have seen it.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
101736,Jai Lava Kusa,6.0,"It's a good and interesting movie to watch. It was a mix of comedy, twists, etc.....really interesting to watch."
102295,Underwater!,5.0,"Pretty bland, plodding treasure recovery movie (there's no real hunting in this). Jane Russell is of course beautiful and the underwater photography was decent, but otherwise rather forgettable. **2.25/5**"
102382,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,7.0,"The story is predictable and with zero neurons on it but Garfield and Stone connection is good and the comedy moments sort of enjoyable.

Probably you could remove the super-hero mess and you would  had a much better romantic comedy."
102513,Washington Wolves,5.0,"The plot is quite simple and even weak but the performances are great and the characters well done.

The OST, however is some kind of bad a-la ""Twin Peaks"" which gives an overall cheap impression on the movie."
102651,Maleficent,7.5,"Nice re-interpretation of the sleeping beauty children's tale. Angelina Jolie has some really good moments in which a simple smile from her can make you shit your pants, although the interpretation is, in some parts, irregular. Elle Fanning is not a good option as ""the Beauty"" in the same way Kristen Stewart wasn't for Snow White. Angelina eats completely her role as Charlize Theron eat Stewart's. Sharito Copley has a great performance, as always, and the FX are really decent."
102651,Maleficent,7.0,Good movie seeing how maleficent became maleficent. Pretty bogus what they did to her. Now she fights to get her wings back.
102780,Byzantium,9.0,"With it's beautiful cinematography, steady pace, and understated acting, <i>Byzantium</i> is solid modern Gothic vampire tale. A bit reminiscent of <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> and <i>The Moth Diaries</i>, we see mother and daughter vampire in current day and through flashbacks and storytelling are told of how they came to be and the loneliness of their existence.

<i>Byzantium</i> is a slow burn and never takes any drastic chances. It forgoes the cheese of many vampire films and remains melancholy throughout. This certainly won't be for everyone, yet there is definitely something worthy here."
102899,Ant-Man,6.0,"I like Paul Rudd and was hoping this would be as funny as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' but it wasn't. It looked good and the direction was solid but I think it suffered from the constant screenplay rewrites that the film underwent by changing the screenwriters (Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish).

I also felt it was a bit too long-winded and it was unbalanced. However, the main good feature in this film was the special effects.

★★★"
102899,Ant-Man,7.0,"This movie is like a mix of honey I shrunk the kids' with some action in it, and it's made by Marvel. Plus it's really funny."
102899,Ant-Man,7.0,"This movie is like a mix of honey I shrunk the kids' with some action in it, and it's made by Marvel. Plus it's really funny."
102899,Ant-Man,7.0,"This movie is like a mix of honey I shrunk the kids' with some action in it, and it's made by Marvel. Plus it's really funny."
103269,Superman vs. The Elite,6.0,"One of the better Superman releases I've seen. Surprised to see The Elite in a movie, even an animated one, but they were great. Maybe in terms of the morality it explores, _Superman vs. The Elite_ and I are not always on the same page, but at least it bothers to explore it.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
103332,Ruby Sparks,7.0,"Interesting comedy from Zoe Kazan which will catch your attention.

The cast is well chosen with a main character cat to the size of Dano. A good movie but nothing very special."
103663,The Hunt,9.0,"Well scripted, well performed, well staged.

A round movie with a fantastic Mads Mikkelsen. Honestly, I think this movie would have been even better with some more minutes on it to develop the plot even further.

Fantastic directing."
103663,The Hunt,10.0,"Viewers beware: this is not an easy or light watch.

Mads Mikkelsen absolutely kills it as a somewhat lonely single man, who suddenly finds love and welcomes his son to live with him.

That's all I'll reveal in the review, no spoilers here.

But again, this isn't a light film, nor should it be. This tackles the subject matter with the poise it deserves, with stunning performances from Mads as well as the entire supporting cast. The script and cinematography lend themselves perfectly to the task at hand, delivering a well-crafted portrayal of love, friendship, and ruin.

Excellent."
103663,The Hunt,7.0,"""Don't accuse someone of thing with ignorance, you'll regret it later"" - Quran"
104173,The Belle Starr Story,6.0,Spaghetti western vehicle showcasing the very beautiful Ms. Martinelli. She looks great in various forms of dress and undress. Eastman does his usual thing and Woods has a minor role essentially. Not much action to be found here but Martinelli fans will be pleased.
104244,The Possessed,7.0,"Watched this as part of a Giallo Essentials box set and while it's not at all bad, in fact some excellent black and white cinematography, the story is a bit slow in developing however not sure I'd classify this as giallo, this was a film noir mystery. However, performances were decent and as a whole found it engaging enough. **3.75/5**"
104396,Dickson Experimental Sound Film,6.0,"There's something very charming hearing the tune of the violin with the crackles expected from record such old audio. The fact that we are even able to play both video and audio together shows this is definitely a film for the history books. Even though it isn't even the focus of the film, being able to subtly hear the director's voice caught on the recording gives this a more home movie film vibe."
104427,The Affairs of Annabel,2.0,A screwball comedy that doesn't quite pull it off. It is too predictable and repetitious.
104852,Newark Athlete,4.0,"Being able to view this short film is very neat. Seeing something so old preserved in such a state makes being able to witnessed film history quite satisfying. However, it's age doesn't forgive the material itself to be quite boring. I have no idea if faster prints of the film exist, but seeing a young man swing around clubs slowly isn't anything too spectacular. Definitely a form of entertainment from an era long gone."
104880,Shadows of Liberty,10.0,Speaking truth to power is a dangerous game not to be played by the faint-of-heart.  I remain unconvinced that any among us would sacrifice power for truth; it is and always will be the fundamental flaw of human nature.  I don't recommend this film to anyone who believes otherwise; watching it will only perpetuate that delusion.
105158,Edison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze,6.0,There is just something magical being able to see a man from nearly 150 years ago in such high quality act out a small scene. Thankfully the small runtime works out in the film's favor. A small interesting short film for a small sneeze.
105704,Bedhead,6.0,"Made by Robert Rodriguez while he was a student at the University of Texas, Austin. His brothers and sisters were the actors. His family and friends were the crew. It won cash prizes in several film festivals, which Rodriguez then used to help produce his first feature film, El Mariachi (1992)"
105864,The Good Dinosaur,10.0,"Okay. I loved this up until the end. His height has been clearly defined.

Wilderness in this is incredible. I love that forest canyon. Wide sweeping shots. Fun characters and good conflicts. So much crazy tension built up to the scene where everything comes to a head. And it's dinosaurs running around bashing stuff up.

I once swam in a river down stream from a dam. Every moment I imagined I would die smashing into rocks and trees as a wall of water took me out."
106021,Erased,7.0,"Decent if not uneven suspense-thriller has shades of a B-level Bourne movie, but I liked Aaron Eckhart in the lead. Starts off well enough and kind of loses some steam in the middle with a satisfying enough ending. **3.5/5**"
106296,The Monster and the Girl,6.0,"Seems like Paramount, in their attempt to get into the monster-horror genre, spliced in two movies, one a crime-drama the other a monster sci-fi thriller, and makes for an entertaining (if not silly) little flick, though still pretty weak. As the movie was nearing the halfway point of a short 65-minute running time, I was wondering when the monster was going to come in... **2.75/5**"
106446,Anything You Want,6.0,"A movie that can be explained as an experiment in which several topics mixed together.

Interesting, but not that much ..."
106513,The Payoff,5.0,"A public prosecutor is murdered and a wise-cracking tabloid journalist (Lee Tracy) with contacts (legit and not) sets out to track down the perpetrator. As we progress through this unremarkably procedural crime thriller, we discover that the murderer is much closer to home than he'd like. The cast do their jobs well enough - Tina Thayer and Tom Brown; but essentially this is just an opportunity for Tracy to be, well, himself."
106646,The Wolf of Wall Street,6.0,An excessive movie in all possible senses with breath taking Margot Robbie and Jonah Hill which is not long in spite of its 3h length but which ends not knowing exactly which is the point of the story.
106646,The Wolf of Wall Street,9.0,"An amazing bio pic of Jordan Belfort that has everything you'll ever want: comedy, drama, romance, heart and the list goes on. This movie was an absolute joy. The acting was superb in this movie all around. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances of his career. Jonah Hill and Margo Robbie were fantastic! For a movie that was almost three hours, it flew by and was incredibly engaging. I can not believe it took me this long to see it.

**Score:** _90%_
**Verdict:** _Excellent_"
106717,The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh,3.0,"Might not have been a great one to do drunk.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._"
107289,The Tree in a Test Tube,6.0,"Interesting aside, an educational short guest-starring Laurel and Hardy and narrated by fellow comedian Pete Smith. Decent but not essential. I found it both as a bonus on an excellent Laurel and Hardy 10-disc boxed set as well as a bargain-basement 5-disc set of questionable value and aesthetic integrity."
107397,Nathalie: Escape from Hell,6.0,"I'm not overly familiar with Nazispolitations (this is the first one I've seen) but this was an okay enough movie, though had a difficult time getting past the awful dubbing, many scenes where the mouth isn't even open, plus an instance of a line of dialogue being repeated back-to-back. Still, Patrizia Gori is a beaut and Jacqueline Laurent's cackling was hilarious yet also oddly scary. **2.75/5**"
107590,Thamizh Padam,6.5,"This is the first tamil spoof movie, spoofing anniyan, dhool, roja, etc.,"
107653,Fifteen Scaffolds for the Killer,6.0,"Routine spaghetti western. Many familiar faces in this one, Hill and Martin go back and forth throughout but the director Malasomma couldn't cobble it together, the ending is an unsatisfactory sell-out. 3 / 5 for the cast and cinematography."
107662,Funny Little Bunnies,9.0,"my favorite short on my silly symphony VHS as a child, it's still as good as I remember now I have it on DVD and now no messing about having to fast-forward a tape."
107811,21 & Over,7.0,Really hilarious movie. I was laughing pretty hard on some stuff. It's worth a watch for sure!
107846,Escape Plan,6.0,"The Stallone/Schwarzenegger team-up we've deserved for 30 years. And it's a good thing that the part of the movie with the two of them together worked, because everything outside of that sucks. But _Escape Plan_ does work exclusively off the back of the two experiences we get to see of them in gaol.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
107846,Escape Plan,6.0,Arnold Schwarzenegger and slyvester Stallone do a good job in this one. He's like the Houdini of prison escapes. Decent movie and worth a watch.
108173,Killpoint,6.0,"cast of veteran greats, most of which meet their end via exploitation violence, in this low budget action thriller."
108954,Postmen in the Mountains,9.0,"This is quite the incredible story a father and son relationship. Told with awesome acting, gorgeous landscape, even pace, character development, and appropriate cinematography, it all adds up to a beautiful, eminently enjoyable film."
109418,Grown Ups 2,7.0,Just as good as the first. That's pretty hard to do. I love the rematch in the basketball game too.
109424,Captain Phillips,8.0,"Well done movie, good script and exceptional performances. Specially by Hanks and Abdi but also the rest of the pirates crew.

Hanks could have won the Oscar for this one."
109443,Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues,5.0,"Not as good as the 1st. Not as funny either. It was ok, but could have been way better."
109445,Frozen,6.0,"Great animation and good voice talent, however pretty weak story but ultimately entertaining enough movie. Also found the music, outside of the song ""Let It Go"" (which was played to death for the past several years now) were rather forgettable and bland. **3.0/5**"
109445,Frozen,5.0,"Not a fan of this movie. It's a great story, but the singing is annoying. The kids love it though."
109451,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6.0,"Much more effort involved than your typical ""animated kid's movie sequel made in the 21st century"". The story might not be quite as straightforward as the first _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs_, but it ups the fantastical quality, making me appreciate it even more. Such a great hangover film.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
109451,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8.0,"Trying to follow what is happening in this movie is just not gonna happen, but the visuals are so bright and fun I don't think anyone will care."
109491,Beautiful Creatures,3.5,"Boring and too cheese.

The same way Percy Jackson is a bad copy of Harry Potter, Beautiful creatures is a bad copy of Twilight. The big difference is that Percy Jackson is a bad copy of a good series of novels and movies while Beautiful Creatures is a bad copy of yet another bad series of novels and movies."
109491,Beautiful Creatures,6.0,Another love story for a non mortal. It's been done  so much now that it's silly to even watch any more but at least she did do some pretty cool stuff.
109720,S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Monolith's Whisper,8.5,"STALKER: Monolith's Whisper tells the story of Alexey Savchuk, an exiled victim of the 1986 Chernobyl accident who enters the Exclusion Zone to find his lost brother after ""The Second Catastrophe"" where a mysterious second explosion takes place in 2006 at the Nuclear Power Plant. Helped by Seeker, he will experience the vicissitudes of ""The Zone"" and try to reach his objective. Stalker Team Uruguay has brought the video game to real life up to every detail, so get ready to enter ""The Zone""!"
110160,Laurence Anyways,8.0,"It would be wrong to call this ""just another TG movie."" It's an intense love story, told in a throwback avant-garde style, which is pretty impressive. I enjoyed both the art that was intended to reflect the lives of two artists, as well as the story. "
110398,No,8.0,Interesting and informative movie about the events that started the transition in Chile from the dictatorship to the democracy.
110415,Snowpiercer,8.0,"Original IP Post-Apocalyptia as well as the 21st century can possibly dish it out.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
110420,Wolf Children,9.5,"The movie is beautifully animated and an emotional Rollercoaster ride.
Topped only by the excellent Soundtrack by Takagi Masakatsu."
110420,Wolf Children,7.0,"A modern approach to the myth of the wolverine in the wolf extincted Japan.

The animation is really fantastic, specially the background staging.

The story is interesting and is quite touching the struggle of the mother to raise her children but at some point it becomes a bit boring for lack of rythm."
116149,Paddington,8.0,"**Keeps getting funnier each time I see it.**

The kind of perfect family film that has something for all ages, not just kids.  There is plenty of sly adult humour that isn't dodgy, and enough slapstick so the kids will laugh at the silly bear's antics.

On top of that it is well animated, and full of heart.

8/10"
116149,Paddington,6.0,"So fuckin' cute. I mean the whole aspect of this movie's ""villain"" was a disaster, but what a delight it was to watch Paddington go. 

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
116641,Psycho Sisters,3.0,"This shot-on-shiteo horror film could be forgiven for the bad production values like lighting, editing, video quality, etc but what does this in, beyond the bad acting and terrible writing, was it just was dull to the point I started thinking about others things I needed to do around the house. Also not helping, it's 91-minutes long and could've easily been 80 minutes. **1.5/5**"
116745,The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,7.0,"The story is too simple but enjoyable and the photography is gorgeous.

Best thing is seeing Shirley MacLaine and Kristen Wiig and Adrian Martinez performances."
116745,The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,8.0,"A truly underrated movie in my opinion. Excellent story, beautiful cinematography, and an inspirational message that somehow got overlooked. Life is meant to be lived, to be experienced... not day dreamed about, or fantasized in our heads! Get up, get out there, and get living!! I enjoyed this movie, as well as Ben Stiller's performance."
116745,The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,7.0,"This surprised me in that I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Of course it was foolish of me to doubt Ben Stiller’s magic both as actor and director. Given the imagination of Mitty’s mundane character, some sequences in the film are surprisingly high octane action movie.  I had expected Mitty to be less likeable and more mundane than he actually was but given the action that he eventually realises, perhaps a hidden dynamism needs to be hinted at earlier.  Overall, a very enjoyable film for all ages. Great Performances and some amazingly photogenic scenery.   7/10"
116977,Foodfight!,1.0,Not even close to excellent as many films made are!!! Foodfight is definitely not worth your time and money with animation that looks half done through computer effects!!
117263,Olympus Has Fallen,5.0,"Out of the wealth of ""_Die Hard in an (X)_"" movies that are on offer, ""_Die Hard in the White House_"" is an.... okay one. The story is old hat and the CGI is awful, but the sequence of the initial attack on the White House isn't just good, it's great.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
117263,Olympus Has Fallen,8.0,Great movie with action throughout. Lots of drama as well. Just your average insane crew trying to take over the white house.
117974,Sightseers,6.0,"My Plex account listed this movie as being a ""Drama Romance Crime Thriller Horror Comedy"". We laughed, but that's actually pretty accurate.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._"
117974,Sightseers,8.0,"Wheaton pulls off this black comedy well. It is a quiet crescendo of unpleasant characters justifying their anti social actions with the logic internal to their own moral micro-cosmos. Watching Sightseers is an experience of being torn between being amused, feeling guilty for being amused, and repulsion against the protagonists and even most of the minor character that has the misfortune to cross their paths. Do not watch for feelgoods. Watch it for feel-urghs. But do watch it because it is worth a watch."
118289,Diana,5.0,"Naomi Watts portrays a great Diana but the movie is otherwise meaningless. It wants to focus on her love story with Dr. Hasnat leaving everything aside, even everything else that could have done this movie interesting."
118300,Escape from Zahrain,5.0,"Yul Brynner, Sal Mineo and Jack Warden star in this sort of revolutionary ""Ice Cold in Alex"" yarn about a wanted freedom-fighter and a rag-tag band of followers who try to escape from the tyrannical government of Zahrain by taking an ambulance across the desert. Any budget was spent on the stars (and, probably, the aircon) leaving little left for script or decent photography. It's a run-of-the-mill vehicle for the star that moves along well enough. Not one of Ronald Neame's best efforts, though his only of 1962."
118340,Guardians of the Galaxy,8.0,"Really funny and with great spcial effects. Probably, one of the movies not to miss this year."
118340,Guardians of the Galaxy,8.5,"Like most of the reviews here, I agree that Guardians of the Galaxy was an absolute hoot. Guardians never takes itself too seriously which makes this movie a whole lot of fun.

The cast was perfectly chosen and even though two of the main five were CG, knowing who voiced and acted alongside them completely filled out these characters.

Guardians of the Galaxy is one of those rare complete audience pleasers. Good fun for everyone!"
118340,Guardians of the Galaxy,8.0,"The thing about this film when I first saw it, was the incredible juxtaposition of sadness, humor and courage. Great acting! The music is superb. That Sony Walkman must be the best bit of brand advertising ever engaged by a company within a film. The film should appeal to a broad range of viewers."
118340,Guardians of the Galaxy,9.0,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a gorgeous and wonderfully entertaining space opera. The characters are so damn lovable, the world building is incredible, the soundtrack gives the film an entirely unique feel, and the effects are astoundingly first rate.

The story follows the pattern of the space fantasies that influenced George Lucas, but the presentation is the work of the extraordinarily gifted filmmaker James Gunn. If we ever forget that the MCU was ever a thing (we won't but let's just be hypothetical), many generations will still be talking about this fantastic movie."
118340,Guardians of the Galaxy,6.0,A good nerd flick for the geeks! At least this one has some humor. My daughter loves Groot.
118605,Fighters,10.0,"Great documentary. Focusing on various East End boxing gyms in the early 90s, Fighters shines a light British boxing's dream factories with the various players all aiming to make it big and escape a harsh and unforgiving East End. Overall a brilliant, gritty and fascinating documentary with a real insight into the pain game."
118646,Friends of Mr. Sweeney,6.0,Given the actors it is a sure bet that this is a wild comedy. But the film is more than that. There is enough drama and romance to make the plot interesting in itself. The execution is above average and we are not left disappointed.
118957,Bait,7.0,"Not a bad Shark horror film, since Jaws.
The Aussies never disappoint."
119450,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,8.0,"The story may not be the most original, with its Shakespearean turn overs, but it is well shaped and  Serkis performance is remarkable.

The animation of the apes, which was already superb in the previous movie, finally reaches a level in which you can believe they are more real than the human actors.

Maybe a bit too long, but a good time for a not totally dumb movie."
119569,Marvel One-Shot: Item 47,7.0,"_Item 47_ is probably the most complete Marvel One-Shot as a stand-alone entity, unfortunate that it never payed off in the MCU at large in the way that you might hope.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
119643,The Violet Seller,6.0,"""La Violetera"" is a a 1958 Spanish-Italian musical film designed to showcase the beauty and talents of its star Sarita Montiel. And it does it with success.

However the sound synchronization is not perfect, sometimes Sara looks like she is dubbing herself, and the sound for the music numbers can be bad at times on non restored copies of this movie."
119822,"Bert Rigby, You're a Fool",10.0,"This is a simple movie with a simple premise: A striking coal miner who loves classic Hollywood movies follows his passion to give his family a better life than coal mining. 
The movie satirizes the cultural clashes all around us and focuses on the particularly strange cult of personality that infuses big motion picture Hollywood.
This is a feel-good date movie that teaches you that following your dreams doesn't get you where you think you're going but they get you where you need to be."
120077,Running Free,9.0,"Slow on the start, but if you love horses, and I do, this is a must see. Keep in mind, this movie is from the perspective of the horse, the human beings are incidental.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
120108,Game Day,8.0,"Definitely not your average sports comedy. Basketball sequences are really cool, shot with energy and interesting angles. The story is pretty dark, and there's a shocking twist. Richard Lewis does a good job balancing burnt out loser and inspirational(?) coach. Surprised to see Kenny Albert in here, and also Greg Griraldo makes an appearance (full cast list at www.gamedaythefilm.com)"
120298,The Shadow of the Tyrant,5.0,Interesting movie from the perspective of how Mexican politics work from a fictional point of view. The performance are good but the story could be better developed.
120467,The Grand Budapest Hotel,7.0,"Yet another well crafter Wes Anderson's movie. Fiennes and Revolori perform well and the amount of well known actors and actresses is incredible but we have seen similar ways and scripts in his previous movies.

It's entertaining, though."
120605,The Punisher: Dirty Laundry,10.0,"What an excellent short movie. This film is a welcome surprise for all fans of the character and all Punisher fans that want to see more of the character, on screen, done properly.

If only War Zone and the original Punisher with Thomas Jane could have been as good as this fan made short."
120850,Line of Sight,8.0,"Lucas Brunelle goes for it. If you want to see what it's like to play a live game of 'frogger', on a bike, with only one life, check out Line Of Sight.

-Mat Hoffman, Professional BMX Rider"
120866,Child of Manhattan,10.0,"OMG, John Boles is ravishing in this movie and Nancy Carroll is the perfect match for him."
121171,The Dover Boys at Pimento University or The Rivals of Roquefort Hall,10.0,Simply one of the funniest and best cartoons not starring a major cartoon icon that I have ever seen. Stunningly good. A DVD extra on 'Desperate Journey' from my 'TCM Spotlight: Errol Flynn Adventures' 5-film boxed set.
121301,Like Rabid Dogs,6.0,"Some truly disturbing scenes but too much meandering in the middle like the commissioner having one of his female officers dress up as a prostitute (and we get a scene of her dressing up, him enjoying it all the while), that really doesn't lead anywhere. The finale was okay but a tad anticlimactic. All in all, like many of these Italian crime-thrillers I've been watching, has its moments but also scenes that are pure fluff. This one does have the sleaze factor for fans of that sort of movie. **3.25/5**"
121390,Blades,4.0,"Not sure what the point of this was. Yeah, it's Jaws on a golf course instead of the ocean and a mower instead of a shark. None of it works and is quite dull for a fair amount of the overly long 98-minute running time. Some of the gore effects were alright I guess but otherwise I really didn't care for this, even by B-movie standards. **2.0/5**"
121498,Creep Van,3.0,"When known paedophile Victor Salva watched _Creep Van_, he said to himself ""This! This what my film series has been missing! Crap!"" and stole that for _Jeepers Creepers 3_. Released in 2012, but seemingly made in 1989, _Creep Van_ is hardly gonna ruin my life or anything, but it was bad. Baaad.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
121856,Assassin's Creed,9.0,"Fun film. Has plenty of action sequences and great plot twists throughout the film that make it more interesting. Plenty of well developed characters throughout, and each character has great depth. The execution of the stunts was superb and had breathtaking set-pieces throughout. It's more faithful to the games than other previous game adaptions like Doom and Warcraft: The Beginning, and it moves away from the story while keeping what made the games so well received. A great movie, definitely worth the watch."
121856,Assassin's Creed,4.0,"I have the advantage of multiple _Assassin's Creed_ games under my belt, and even to me it was nonsense. Wastes an **incredible** cast on what will wind up contributing to the seemingly never-ending pile of lacklustre videogame adaptations.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
121856,Assassin's Creed,4.0,"YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE! You were supposed to destroy the bad video movies, not join them! Bring balance to cinema, not leave it in darkness!﻿"
121945,CHiPs '99,7.5,"I think CHiPS '99 was a lot of fun! No profanity, no sex, and Judge Judy of all people making a guest appearance! The action scenes are of course, very exciting to watch. It was also fun to see what happened in Jon and Ponch's lives since 1983. It was incredible that Larry Wilcox did all of his own stunts on top of a moving tour bus! Way to go!"
121971,Uptight,8.0,"Set in Cleveland's Black activist scene following the death of MLK, this is both exhilarating and entertaining. It is a retelling of John Ford's _Informer_,  directed by Jules Dassin in a return to American filmmaking. Beautiful nighttime photography with strong ensemble acting add to this bold, fascinating film. Long unavailable, it is worth re-discovering."
121986,Frances Ha,7.0,"Frances Ha worked really well for me. The performance from Greta Gerwig was brilliant, she carried the film. There is a perfect balance of quirky comedy and heartbreaking drama. I was giggling and tearing up constantly at the journey of Frances. But the overall story was a great ride that ends with such a satisfying conclusion. It is a fantastic feel-good story about self-discovery and perseverance. Noah Baumbach is not one of my favorite directors, but this was definitely a hit for me.

Score: 75%
Verdict: Good"
122473,Strike Commando 2,5.0,"Sequel takes a more purposeful comedic tone and rip offs Raiders of the Lost Ark, Apocalypse Now and Romancing the Stone. The comedy score that oddly pops in and out was annoying and the action elements weren't quite as fun as the first, but appreciate some of the bad elements. Brent Huff takes over the lead role and seems to have less charisma than Reb Brown and seeing Richard Harris in this was amusing (not that he was beyond appearing in bad movies. **2.25/5**"
122746,"Adios, Hombre",7.0,"Slightly above average spaghetti with good cinematography and excellent camera shots/angles. Typical revenge western with an overlong saloon brawl including showgirls, who add nothing to the movie except filler. Good performance as usual by Fajardo and a great shot of Hill's pistol near the end (similar shot the following year in Hill's ""I Want Him Dead"", a much better spaghetti.) Obvious cuts with about 8 mins. total missing."
122906,About Time,8.0,"Cute and fun, with great cast and performances and nice English humor.

Just, it is too good, too neat ... but a good movie for getting out of the theater with optimism and faith in life."
122906,About Time,4.0,kind of a dumb movie. he has the ability to time travel for his life but he doesnt do anything worth seeing. they also make a bad looking couple too. im not sure what this movie is suppose to be about because there isnt much of a storyline at all. and he uses his time travel to fix the dumbest stuff. not even worth watching in my opinion.
122906,About Time,9.0,"When you watch the movie, you will realize that it gives love to all the characters in the appropriate and best way. The movie is wonderful and beautiful, and I recommend it to all people. I loved it very much, to an indescribable degree."
122917,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,5.0,"As there was not much more to be told from the end of the previous movie, just assist to more than 2h of continuous battle.

Quite pointless, but you may enjoy the action if that is what you were looking for ..."
123025,"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1",9.0,"The only area in which _The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1_ suffers, is foretold in the title: This is just part one. You watch those two parts combined back to back? You've got the best superhero movie ever made.

_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._"
123109,No One Lives,6.0,"A pleasant surprise from WWE Studios. NO ONE LIVES is a tight, nasty genre gem from Japanese schlockmeister Ryuhei Kitamura.

Also features suitably gritty cinematography (on Super16mm film) from TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE's Daniel Pearl."
123389,Mr. Hush,1.5,"A modernized rendition of classic horror… I am now a believer in MR. HUSH!

-Rob Dimension, Horror Society
.

Horror Fans will seek this film out.

-Kevin G Shinnick, Scarlet The Film Magazine
..

Sinister cinema is alive and well… MR. HUSH is an intriguing mystery from the get-go!

-Jonathan Stryker, Horror Express"
123553,The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.0,"Bad and disjointed movie created at the warmth of Harry Potter and Hunger Games series. Only, this time doesn't work at all. Lot's of FX for an incoherent and boring story.

Worst of all, no reason to call this episode ""City of Bones"" since it doesn't play a major role, at all. At least, not in the movie."
123553,The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,10.0,"I absolutely love this movie and I will die on this hill. Yes it's campy and a bit predictable, but it's light hearted, fun, and entertaining.

The acting isn't the best I've seen, but the casting is still perfect. It doesn't align perfectly with the books, but I don't think that scores against it.


I've lost track of how many times I've rewatched it. 10/10 flawless"
123863,All-American Murder,5.0,"Pretty bad movie on its own but could have that good-bad element with trite dialogue and poor acting, or in the case of Christopher Walken sleepwalking through his part, must've been desperate for any money he could get at that point. There's also no real surprises with the culprit pretty obvious from the start. **2.25/5**"
124348,Eric Clapton & Friends in Concert,10.0,"**A brilliant concert, with extraordinary guest musicians, nevertheless the great surprise is a solo by Tim Carmon, a member of Clapton's band, on keyboards during the song ""Old Love"" -a performance not to be missed or forgotten. **"
124385,Date with Disaster,5.0,"This is an odd film - the cast don't gel at all. The story is the usual run-of-the-mill stuff as a gang carry out a robbery but soon discover, with the police on their tail, that one of their number isn't reliable so turn this case of robbery into one of murder. William Hartnell is the henchman who holds this together but Shirley Eaton and Tom Drake (presumably drafted in to bolster US box office attendance) have all the chemistry of yesterday's scrambled eggs. Decent enough production standards though the ending is a bit hammy."
124409,Expect No Mercy,6.0,"Watchable enough 1990s direct-to-video martial arts thriller with the usual cheesy effects that era though virtual reality would be. Still, the fights were decent thanks to the physicality of Billy Blanks. Plus Laurie Holden was a cutie. Not bad and worth checking out on a slow weekend. **2.75/5**"
124450,Chilling At Sundown,3.5,"""Chilling At Sundown"" delivers perfect chilled music to relax with while imersing in the beautiful twilight glow. Catch the magic of the moment as nature delivers ist unsurpassed show with the sun setting across the sea and releasing an ultimate explosion of energy before disappearing in the horizon. This is true beauty in its rawest form, a moment of deep communion with nature for you to live over and over again"
124459,The Incredible Burt Wonderstone,6.0,"My ten word review:

_It's like Blades of Glory but with magicians. Fun stuff!_

Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/47JOCvTVnc4"
124668,The Chill Factor,2.0,"This is, without question, the crown jewel of my Shoctober 2024 viewing—a masterclass in combining the worst writing, acting, and directing possible. Imagine my delight when I stumbled upon this gem on the BFI website, where it was described as The Exorcist meets the Winter Olympics, promising a thrilling combo of demonic possession and snowbound slashing. Instead, I got a painfully dull, creatively bankrupt mess where the biggest horror was the acting, and the snow somehow managed to feel less cold than the performances. Christopher Webster, who directed this and was producer of Hellraiser, must be so proud!"
124827,Up Your Teddy Bear,3.0,"Mess of a comedy, cheap looking and tawdry, this is still a fascinating, bizarre curio with an interesting cast. Toy executive Newmar tries to recruit Cox, using Buono to try at trap him. Cox is an obsessive girl watcher! Comes off as a series of random skits, with a lot of pretty women. Quincy Jones is credited for the music, played by Eyes Of Blue. Some interesting shots of L.A. circa 1970."
125470,George and the Christmas Star,10.0,"A fun, heartwarming Christmas adventure.  It feels both offbeat and familiar and has a variety of escapades but still manages to keep a lowkey atmosphere, and an excellent music solo, all in a 20 minute package.  I personally enjoy it even more than the Peanuts Christmas special.  One of many Canadian productions from the 80's that's practically impossible to find a copy of these days."
126172,Leprechaun: Origins,3.0,"Sure is an odd naming convention for a movie that contains neither an Origin nor a Leprechaun. I guess they didn't have faith in the more accurate title: _The Lamer Adventures of Scar from The Descent for Some Reason_. 

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
126413,Sandow,5.0,"This is really only notable and an example of very early cinema photography as the eponymous body-builder flexes and pouts his way through just under a minute of screen time. It is also interesting as a curio of what people paid to watch at the end of the 19th century, and is probably just about the correct length to avoid it becoming repetitive."
126451,The Crimes of Stephen Hawke,6.0,"Look out for a very young Eric Portman in this cheery cannibalisation of quite a few stories and characters. Nothing at all original here, but it's fun to watch Tod Slaughter being, well, himself."
126692,Prelude: Dog Star Man,8.0,"I adored this, quite reasonably regarded as one of the finest post-silent short experimental works. Confused why it's regarded as five separate films, though.

Seen on my university library's Criterion Collection DVD of Brakhage's anthology, Volume 1. I certainly hope to purchase for my own collection the blu release of Volumes 1 and 2."
126889,Alien: Covenant,6.0,"I agree with most of the negative comments about this movie.It is a gigantic missed opportunity.My biggest issue apart from the utter predictability and nonsensical,inept script,was the disappointment of seeing 'Prometheus' mixed up with 'Alien'
Alien covenant gets locked up in its own self importance while forgetting why we loved 'Alien' in the first place.I really wanted to like it but came a way  with a huge sense of disappointment"
127037,Wild Poses,9.0,"This 'Our Gang' short with a cameo by Laurel and Hardy was a nice bonus on my Laurel and Hardy boxed set, as Otto Phocus tries his darnedest to take a family portrait of Spanky and his parents, and all hell breaks loose. One of the Gang's best shorts, in fact."
127380,Finding Dory,6.0,A tiresome joke in the first movie becomes the central premise and is incredibly over-used.
127585,X-Men: Days of Future Past,6.0,"Not as good as the previous X-Men movies but it has a pass... Jennifer Lawrence doesn't even get close to Rebecca Romijn. Also, Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are really far from their senior characters performed by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart but the rest of original cast from first 2000's movie are great, as always."
127713,The Story Of Short Stack,9.0,"A spectacular look inside the minds of three boys from New South Wales that stole the hearts of many. The mix of insane comedy, tear jerking struggles and fun misadventures makes The Story Of Short Stack a must see for anyone wondering what it really is like in the music industry."
127817,Blinkity Blank,6.0,"Norman McLaren again draws straight onto the film with this engaging animation. It is intended to test just how long an image remains with your eye, even though it has since disappeared from the screen. For me, the use of flickering imagery here resembles a lively firework display."
127846,A Hijacking,8.0,"A european version of Captain Phillips: less action, yet a more thoughtful story and screenplay. Another great Danish movie."
127864,Blancanieves,7.0,This is a highly creative version of Snow White that looks and wounds exactly like an old silent movie. It was so well done that I was invested in the characters by the end and therefore somewhat disappointed by the finale.

128717,Tread Softly,3.0,"Odd mix of light, frivolous musical and dark murder mystery. Bentley's new musical needs a theatre so he arranges to hire old lady Nicholson's disused hall. Trouble is, they find a body behind the stage.  The cast aren't phased by this and carry on rehearsing their silly songs and dances while the gruff cops investigate. After another murder, things get serious, but not much. A decidedly second-rate movie with a second-league cast of no distinction., only the backstage setting is of interest."
128721,The Twenty Questions Murder Mystery,3.0,"A strange attempt to make a movie attraction based on a staid BBC radio panel show. The regulars of the show appear as themselves, very stiffly. A listener sends in questions to be answered on the show, committing a murder to match each of his suggestions. Tough reporter Beatty and cute Anderson try to catch him. The mystery is less interesting than seeing the recreation showing how quiz shows were recorded."
128841,The Thompsons,5.0,"The quality in terms of acting, and especially video quality, have upped. Well and truly. But all the subtelty of the first movie has been abandoned **hard**. It all sort of balances out, equating to an experience that's about as good as _The Hamiltons_, but for different reasons.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
128956,Anna & Bella,7.0,"The two eponymous sisters aided by a soundtrack straight from a 1970s quiz show and a very little dialogue, have a reminisce over their long years together via their family photo albums. Remember that time there was no toilet roll? Or your first school dance? The red wine flows and their first loves are remembered, laughter follows, then sadness - a typical lifetime really. The animation uses a sort of etching style that sparingly uses colour to help us along to a conclusion that's a little obvious but that doesn't really matter - it's quite a joy to watch."
129303,Pas de Deux,7.0,"It's really hard to describe this work of art, so I'm not going to try. Suffice to say that whether or not you are a fan of ballet, I doubt you will be able to watch this without becoming enthralled. Monochrome throughout, and using some very effective stop-frame photographic techniques, we follow Margaret Mercier and Vincent Warren's gorgeously choreographed duet take shape. The panpipes from Dobre Constantin are hauntingly effective at enveloping this inspired presentation of symmetry and imagery and it's simplicity has got to be a key to it's success. Give it ten minutes, you will enjoy it."
129308,Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye,0.5,"**This movie is a train wreck.** You watch it in spite of yourself. The only redeeming part of the movie was the interracial scene. The sex was tepid which is more than I can say about the rest of the movie. If I were to give this movie a ""thumbs"" rating, I would chop off any thumb that did not attempt to hitchhike its way away from this disaster."
129524,Return of the Killer Shrews,1.0,"While the original is at least moderately endearing, the 50+ years on sequel is bad in every conceivable way.

Final rating:½ - So bad it’s offensive."
130145,The Two-Headed Spy,7.0,"Jack Hawkins wasn't always renowned for the subtlety of his performances, but he does manage that well here. In this quite plausible adaptation of AP Scotland's fact-based book, he portrays a German officer who works his way up the ranks, ultimately to reach staff rank in the Nazi army - whilst passing on secrets to the British for almost 30 years. The direction is suspenseful and it maintains the tension well - especially towards the end. This is rarely seen, nowadays, but is eminently watchable."
131631,The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,10.0,It was good. Although I wish it had more action scenes. It's worth watching ago don't miss out!
131631,The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,4.0,Yet more of the same extended in an inexcusable way. Let's hope the last movie of the saga can get a proper end.
131634,The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.0,"The movie is not bad directed and the cast does a decent job. Actually, the script is a good adaptation of the book.

The problem is that the story of the book is already quite bad and has gone down the sink by now so the whole movie just doesn't work."
131723,Mississippi,8.0,"I sold this film to myself as simply a musical with W.C. Fields and Joan Bennett in it, and it worked for me in that regard. Worth a watch if you're intrigued by bizarrely-plotted musical comedies from the 30's."
132137,Werewolf: The Beast Among Us,3.0,"Very made-for-TV. Pretty incoherent in its canon. Not so good. Strong opening though, and some good looking people. Recommend you stay away from this one, but happening to catch it isn't gonna shatter your world or anything.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
132232,Mama,6.0,"Some wicked creature design and good child actors make up for Mama's ""unfinished"" feeling. Jessica Chastain delivers as usual.

Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go."
132318,New Kimagure Orange Road: Summer's Beginning,9.0,"Nice ending for the magnificent anime series ""Kimagure Orange Road"". A must for any fan of this series."
133255,Harlem Rides the Range,3.0,"A rare all-black cast and crew film. The film suffers from its apparent very low budget, but they make the most of it. I was a bit surprised by there stereotypical behavior of the side-kick, but I suppose that it went with the times. 

The plot is simple and the acting tolerable. Everything appears to have been shot in one take with probably one camera and microphone. Still, if you are interested in early black cinema, this one is worth a watch."
134773,Stopover Tokyo,5.0,"The acting wasn't great and plot not very interesting. And for a movie shot in Tokyo, didn't seem to capture the city or culture very well. Not terrible but nothing I'd ever want to watch again. **2.5/5**"
134781,Bye Bye Blondie,8.0,"Writer/director Virginie Despentes delivers a sweet, if slight, mature-age love story with Bye Bye Blondie, exhibiting considerable growth as a filmmaker since her maddeningly-overrated debut shocker Baise-Moi (2000). Her new movie’s marketing may play up the more lascivious allure of the lesbian pairing of Emmanuelle Béart and Béatrice Dalle, but the film itself is far more interested in exposing the character’s emotions than their flesh."
135130,Moongirl,5.0,"Not that you'd expect much from this, but <em>'Moongirl'</em> is an underwhelming short. It did kickstart Laika's work so that's something. It has a potentially interesting idea, but it never made an impact on me. The animation isn't all that, either."
135368,The Barrens,5.0,"An (at least fractionally) complex horror story based on a cryptid I'm familiar with, but have never seen put to screen before. Cast's not great, but not worth complaining about either. The central creep is held in reserve, almost certainly for monetary reasons, but it works in _The Barrens_' favour. I won't be revisiting this Jersey Devil horror, but I did have an okay time with it.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
135385,Django Kills Softly,5.0,"Django Kills Silently (Softly) is below average. 6'9"" George Eastman was weak as a lead or co-lead in a spaghetti, he didn't have the presence to match his size. There isn't enough here otherwise to suggest it."
135397,Jurassic World,4.0,"Well choreographed action set-pieces. Good effects. Dinosaurs are magnificent.

Annoyingly cliched characters. Stupid story. I thought the idea of commercialism and ethics could have and should have been explored better. A character talks about never being able to match the first part which is true. Not sure if they were trying to be funny or just self-referentially depressing.

Chris Pratt was good. Everyone else was pointless.

No where near the first. I would even prefer to watch Jurassic Park 3 than this.

★★"
135397,Jurassic World,7.0,"MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/

Jurassic World remains my second favorite film of the whole saga.

Colin Trevorrow is able to blend the suspenseful traits of the original with a more adventurous, light tone really well. Dinosaurs look amazing, still today. Characters could have benefited from a little more work. Decent story.

Rating: B"
135397,Jurassic World,6.0,They rebuild the theme park and claim its safe. You can't keep a bunch of Godzilla like dinosaurs contained.
135579,Dead Before Dawn,2.0,"So awkward to watch. Everything is bad in _Dead Before Dawn_, but the performances are so bad it stands out, even in something like this. 

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"
136111,Flying High,4.0,"Without the very welcome early examples of Busby Berkeley dances, this film would be a very, very long sit. This was Berkeley's 4th film."
136400,2 Guns,7.0,"Entertaining enough action-thriller, feels like a ""Spy vs. Spy"" movie. Think if not for Denzel Washington or even Mark Wahlberg, this would've been a wholly forgettable film something Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films (Out of Death, Midnight in the Switchgrass and Fortress to name a few) is now known for. **3.5/5**"
136406,LEGO Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Out,5.0,"Narrowly better than <em>'LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace'</em>, if still pretty lame.

I will say the humour, whilst not good, is actually kinda decent, at least compared to what I was expecting. The story is meh, as is the entire look of this short film. A lower run time could've helped."
136418,Hummingbird,8.0,"An classic Jason Statham action film with quite a few unnecessary touches. Nevertheless, one of my favorites for its simplicity and feel-good story."
136718,Steel Magnolias,1.0,"This is another one of those you can't give it a bad review on IMDb, no matter what, or they will take it down movies.  The result is there there are only 50 reviews.

it's why people need to join the exodus.

Anyway this is sort of like the original but it's race swapped, so the story is more about the swap than it is the novel or the movie or the source material in general.

And that sort of leaves it with a lack of charm."
136795,The Heat,7.5,I honestly can't think of a better movie to replace a mind massage on a hard working Monday's night.
136797,Need for Speed,6.0,"The only thing that kept me watching is the driving action and the fancy cars, otherwise, I would have stopped watching it. Playing the game is more exciting."
136835,No Good Deed,7.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed <em>'No Good Deed'</em>.

Sure it isn't anything incredible and is rather simple, but it delivers on action and brings tension. It also features very good performances Idris Elba (Colin) - somewhat iffy accent aside - and Taraji P. Henson (Terri) - two actors I enjoy. The plot is simple but it's executed well, it doesn't even have the chance to drag either due to the short 83 minute run time.

Not much more to note. A suitably entertaining flick from 2014 by Sam Miller, who also directed Elba in the outstanding television series <em>'Luther'</em>."
137113,Edge of Tomorrow,7.0,"Interesting enough and with a decent script for this kind of Sci-Fi movies. The FX are also OK.

Tom Cruise does an OK job and Emily Blunt nails her character, being the brightest thing in screen every time she appears."
137113,Edge of Tomorrow,8.0,"Not a bad movie, got kind of sick of the ""ground hog day"" effect. Could have used less of that, all in all pretty enjoyable to watch."
137113,Edge of Tomorrow,8.0,"On your feet, maggot! The idea of resetting time is being fully explored and adds to the action – and who doesn’t like to see Tom Cruise die over and over again?

9/10"
137113,Edge of Tomorrow,8.0,"End of the world groundhog day sci-fi monster movie. Tom Cruise playing an utter coward, at least in the beginning, is a refreshing change. This is one of those 'repeat incident' movies you have to keep watching, just to see what's going to change next time around. Oh, and the alien beasts, more over the way they move, are utterly terrifying. Unfortunately, the out-of-step ending leaves you thinking ""Wait, what?"""
137113,Edge of Tomorrow,9.0,"An alien invasion in Europe combined with a Groundhog Day concept, Tom Cruise repeats the same day over and over. Starting the movie as a coward, he slowly goes through his hero's journey becoming a brave hero on his quest tp save humanity from fast-moving parasitic aliens with long gross tentacles. Emily Blunt adds great acting and good chemistry with Cruise on set. The special effects are detailed and fun, especially with the exoskeletons on soldiers and the aliens themselves. Definitely a top sci-fi and worth watching."
137726,The Departure,7.0,"A film that never stops to breathe, when perhaps it should. Lots of striking imagery. I especially loved all the various shots of cars, especially the half car. Léaud’s character is mental and he plays it very well. Also an amazing title sequence 3.5/5"
137856,Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur,6.0,"Set at a time ""before many of us were born"", we visit the home of the hungry ""Casper Caveman"" who wakes up and with his pet dinosaur ""Fido"" and sets off to find food. Meantime, ""Daffy"" is idly paddling in his pond and is soon - well, on the menu. Loads of quickly paced antics, and some fun sound effects follow as possibly the dumbest dinosaur/caveman combo try to ensnare our hero. Loads of fine Dvorak, Mendelssohn and even some Harry Warren keep it entertaining, too!"
138076,Video Games Live: Level 2,10.0,"If you like video games and the music of the worlds you've played in, you're going to LOVE this!"
138372,Bad Kids Go to Hell,4.0,"At its height when parodying _The Breakfast Club_, but unfortunately even that has well and truly been done by now. Maybe not to this extent in the horror genre, but its still most certainly been done.

A lot.

Seperate from that, _Bad Kids Go To Hell_ is a convoluted mess that I just barely don't regret watching.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
138697,Don Jon,7.0,"I found this movie much more interesting that what I thought at first glance.

Gordon-Levitt tells a simple story, but he does it well and the story is interesting enough. His performance is also remarkable and Johansson is spectacular, as always."
138730,The Bewitched House,5.0,"A special effects pioneer. Feels pretty long for six minutes though. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._"
138832,We're the Millers,8.5,"Where do I start! This comedy had me rolling almost from start to finish... some highly questionable scenes, I wouldn't recommend it for families with young children, but older teens will find it amusing I am sure. Interesting Plot, likable characters, and plenty of mishaps to make it just the right amount of humorous. I actually wouldn't mind if they tried to do a follow-up story to this... but only if they could get the same cast to star in it."
138843,The Conjuring,5.0,"I'm a fan of Wan, and while I must say I believe that _The Conjuring_ is pretty severely overrated, it's also one of the best horror films to have hit the mainstream in the past few years.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
138843,The Conjuring,8.0,"Hadn't seen this in a while and watching it again in preparation for the third movie, found it to be well done. I'm not much for these supernatural horror movies but with James Wan's camera work, and the screen presence from Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, makes it an entertaining flick. **3.75/5**"
139567,Fire with Fire,8.0,Living in protective custody. Not so much when they track you down and you gotta fight for your life. Has action mixed with some comedy.
139726,So You Want to Be a Detective,8.0,"This short film, an extra from my blu of 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' is one of the better Richard Bare-directed 'Joe McDoakes' comedic shorts. Like Leonard Maltin states in his introduction to the 1948 'Warner Night at the Movies' that Warner Bros. attempts to recreate with this (as well as the cartoon 'Hot Cross Bunny'), it was a clever homage/satire of both Bogart's detective work in 'The Maltese Falcon' and the first-person point-of-view camera work prevalent in Robert Montgomery's 'Lady in the Lake' from the previous year."
139779,Americans,3.0,"A PSA, staring Kid Rock and Sean Penn on a divided American and trying to unite the two sides. Not sure why they made this, but they did a horrible job of making it entertaining or funny."
139933,Kiss of the Damned,3.0,"Mal actuada, el argumento flojo, en varias partes me hizo acordar a True Blood"
140071,Seize the Day,4.5,"The story is gripping and easy to feel mostly due to down-on-his-luck, Tommy Wilhelm's anger and frustration with life. Dr. Tamkin, is also a highlight, as his best friend with lots of ideas. I felt that the actors playing most of the other parts were a bit like watching a high school play. 
Robin Williams and to a leaser degree Jerry Stiller hold this film together as one hopes for a resolution to a life gone sour."
140276,The Road to Glory,6.0,"Morose tale of trench warfare in France during World War I.  The three principles, Fredric March, Warner Baxter, and Lionel Barrymore, do a proper job here, particularly Warner Baxter.  This film has to be one of the most depressing I've seen, but it's well-written, if a bit slow-moving at times.  No spoilers, but that ending...oh my!

Would I recommend?  Go for it, if you like the genre, the actors, or the period it's set in."
140334,Dreadheads: Portrait of a Subculture,7.0,"Tie dyed colorful, ultra real, edgy...an audacious trip. --Paul Evans - Rolling Stone"
140607,Star Wars: The Force Awakens,2.0,A meaningless continuation of a saga that was decidedly concluded in Return of the Jedi. This is a poor attempt at converting something that was created as a mythical epic into a soap opera.
140644,Function Of Reality,8.0,A great 3D demo which really shows off what your TV/Projector can do. Goes through 6 different worlds built by San Base set to original music.
140721,Lots To Learn Buster's Favorite Animals,7.5,"Great show, got it for my granddaughter 18 months, she stands there the whole time clapping and squealing. It's a blast to watch her."
140823,Saving Mr. Banks,8.0,"Nicely done movie with great performances from Thompson and Hanks. Also Farrell, which a role made perfectly for him.

The story is well threaded, letting us walk through Travers childhood and the birth of the main characters in Mary Poppins' books."
141010,And the Crows Will Dig Your Grave,6.0,"Routine spaghetti western. So-so effort from Hill. Sancho is slightly less over the top but less effective. Brana is reliable as a heavy but appears late.
Wild East transfer picture quality is decent but audio has issues. Dub for Sancho was nearly impossible to understand, which may not be that bad a thing considering it's Sancho.."
141052,Justice League,6.0,The Movie was highly paced. The movie was focusing on how the Justice league assembles. Stupidly shown the Mother Boxes and Stepenwolf. No future prospectus or hints unlike Dawn of Justice. Darkseid and Stepenwolf relation unknown. The movie falls apart as it was mainly focused on Resurrection of Superman and Assemble of other members.
141185,DownWard Spiral,4.0,"Private presents an erotically charged thriller about a stewardess' downward spiral (hence the title) into depravity.
I admit, the police threesome scene was hot, and I did enjoyed the sauna scene - that said, the plot of the film itself was terribly written. And the ending; WFT?

This was the only adult film that I felt disappointing with."
142026,The Dancing Pig,6.0,"An Edwardian-style, suited and respectable looking pig is constantly spurned by his love. She (Edith Trublanchet) scorns and shames him before breaking into a lively and quite well synchronised dance which must have been quite difficult for pig - especially as even the set now starts to conspire against it too! Of course it's not a real pig, but there was something creepy about this that I just didn't like. It humanises the animal only to ridicule it and that makes this short feature almost cruel, reminiscent of circus freakery. Great teeth though!"
142061,"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2",9.0,"The only area in which _The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2_ suffers, is foretold in the title: This is just part two. You watch those two parts combined back to back? You've got the best superhero movie ever made.

_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._"
142115,Five Dances,7.0,"This is a gorgeously photographed and scored story about a young and talented dancer ""Chip"" who arrives in New York to participate in a dance workshop. His co-dancers are the only other characters in this gentle, slow-burn of a love story as, gradually, he develops some confidence which shows in both his performances in the class and with his increasing courage to take his friendship with dance partner ""Theo"" to the next level. The production is polished and elegant - this really is a gem of a film."
143385,Alibhai,7.0,"Alibhai, a mass action movie, portrays a market don in Palayalam market of Calicut, Kerala.The main role is done by Mohanlal and he performs the role effortlesslThe first half has some nice actions sequences and good story bulding but lacks the energy towards the 2nd half. The music and bgm works were good. And as a fan of Mohanlal, its a visual treat with fan-favorite dialogues and slow-moes."
143686,Orphan Train,10.0,I Absolutely Love This Rare film.  It is very educational.  It shows the origin of foster care in Western countries.
143901,CIA II: Target Alexa,3.5,"12 September 2003 | by jadzia92 (Sydney, Australia) – 

I only watched CIA II: Target Alexa due to the presence of Kathleen Kinmont who I fell in love with ever since I first saw her in Fraternity Vacation. Overall the movie is not that good as there were lot of boring dialogue. The movie would have been much better had Kathleen's Fraternity Vacation's co-star Barbara Crampton been in the film with her."
144124,Jack Whitehall: Live,7.5,"Jack Whitehall's debut DVD is brilliant. Fantastically funny and had me rolling on the floor. I've always enjoyed his performances in A league of their own and Mock the week where he bounces off the other guests so I was a little dubious about him performing alone, however he was excellent and I would recommend him to anyone."
144344,The Stranger Returns,7.0,"The Stranger Returns may be the better of the original two overall but suffers from a weak performance by Dan Vadis as ""En Plein"". He had the look but little else. Tony Anthony reprising his ""Stranger"" character of course. Some good scenes, one eating at a table with a henchman. Silly ending."
144354,My Name Is Pecos,7.0,"Entertaining enough spaghetti western features a fine performance by Robert Woods. It has your typical revenge plot so nothing terribly new from the rest, however I did enjoyed it as some of the gunfighrts were decent and the villains were really foul. **3.25/5**"
144375,Christian Lindberg: Total Musician,9.0,"This is a compilation of several individual videos that depict the multiple dimensions of Christian Lindberg. My personal favorite is the segment on writing Chick'aBone Checkout as a world premier performed by Charles ""Charlie"" Vernon of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. You get to watch Charlie and Christian exchanging ideas to put in the piece, debating the performance details, and in general, bringing humanity into the musical equation. It is extraordinary that Christian and Charlie allowed the cameras to film this development over many months."
144393,Annie Oakley,6.0,"One of the early Thomas Edison features that allows legendary gun-slinger Annie Oakley to demonstrate just how efficient she was with a rifle. Luckily for her friend Francis Butler, she doesn't miss!"
144789,I'm So Excited!,7.0,"I was so excited to see this film ever since I saw the trailer coz it’s comedy (dancing flight attendants) and was familiar with the cast like Javier Camara & Cecilia Roth (Paz Vega, Antonio Banderas & Penelope Cruz - although not really main cast). Semi-disappointed with this film like it’s just okay, I wasn’t like wow, so great! Still entertaining though - I like the chemistry of the cast in the plane, the FAs were really funny and their interactions with the pilot! The passengers, didn’t really care that much for them except the horny virgin one. "
144794,The Hard Guy,10.0,"A cute short that served as a screen test for one of the great actors, Spencer Tracy."
145094,The Survival Games,4.0,"A great deal of the movie is taken up with shots of people running through the woods, and bizarrely ending up at the campsite setup by the two couples. The plot is quite predictable, and like many films of this genre, the the good guys don't take the opportunity to finish the bad guys off as soon as they could. My score is 4/10."
145135,Dark Skies,8.0,"Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

Keri Russell does quality crazy lady, and this movie is basically what ""Paranormal Activity"" should have been combined with a good version of a Slenderman movie.

There's a very satisfying conspiracy meat to the plot: the escalating defenses combined with a literally conspiracy theory ""nut"".

Part of the fun of this is that it is all presented in a very real, believable manner.  The atmosphere the movie creates is reason enough to watch it."
145221,Monsters: Dark Continent,1.0,"This is a war movie... with a very minor subplot regarding monsters.

For a war movie, it's  a pretty good one. Reminds me of Blackhawk Down in its production values.

BUT as a sequel to Monsters (which I enjoyed) it is a dismal failure. And I wanted to see a sequel to Monsters, which I did not get."
145660,Home Before Midnight,4.0,"Rock songwriter Aubrey starts affair with tearaway Elliott, not realizing she is 14 years old. Trouble ensues when he continues seeing her after he learns the truth. It all leads to a court appearance. Sober treatment of the subject but the characters never elicit too much interest. Walker had more success with his twisted horror pictures."
146079,Django and Sartana Are Coming... It's the End,3.0,"Among Fidani's worst. Of course that isn't saying much but ol' Dick Spitfire did make a few fairly decent ones. Jack Betts aka Hunt Powers and a boring ""Sartana"" character were equally bad. Even the fake cacti have done better work."
146198,Triple 9,5.0,"An okay movie with some very impressive visual flourishes, but a narrative mess, and not up to par with Director Joh Hillcoat's prior work.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
146216,RED 2,4.0,This movie was a clear example of when studios can't get enough of a good thing. Red didn't need a sequel at all. This cheap attempt at recreating the comedic magic that the the first movie had reminded me plenty of the overkill series of the Hangover. Some things should just be left alone in singular existence. 2/5 Stars is all this got from me.
146216,RED 2,7.0,Still a must-watch but it was never going to live up to the original.
146216,RED 2,8.0,Way better then the first. Way more action too and explosions. This one is hilarious too. It needs a part 3 now.
146233,Prisoners,8.0,"Really intense and well done thriller. One of the few in the last years with great performances by Jackman, Gyllenhaal and Dano.

It also has some content to chew. I really enjoyed watching it."
146233,Prisoners,7.0,"Certainly Villenueve's most accessible film, but still a very good one.

Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time."
146233,Prisoners,8.0,"What a powerful film and what a great acting. I just couldn't help rewinding various scenes throughout, especially when Jackman's character showed anger and frustration for either his child being abducted or having what he thought was the culprit being tortured, although getting nowhere. Definitely a must for Mystery/Drama.

8/10"
146233,Prisoners,10.0,"MUST SEE MOVIES BEFORE YOU DIE,
another masterpiece by Hugh Jackman, surprising plot-twist!!"
146233,Prisoners,8.0,"**This heavy film is not for everyone but for those that enjoy suspenseful crime cinema, this is one of the absolute best.**

A crime thriller that brilliantly manages its slow pace to create the same dread the characters feel in the hearts of the audience. Every passing second steals the parents' hope away that they could ever find their children alive. Everything about this movie emphasizes the story's emotion, from the acting and muted color tones to the sets and directing."
146238,Runner Runner,4.0,"Predictable and forgettable movie. Please, don't let Affleck to perform a bad guy ever again."
146243,Haunt,5.0,"Watchable coming-of-age horror with a wealth of dropped plot points.

Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole."
146301,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,5.0,They at least made this movie to connect with the previous ones. A new family moves into the house where the girls lived 20 years ago.
146449,Loose Ankles,4.0,"Loose Ankles is an early B-grade, pre-code, comedy talkie starring Loretta Young and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.. Like many films of during the transition to talkies the plot is convoluted, the script weak and with mostly poor acting. Still, the film has appeal to those interested in this era."
146731,Hot Cross Bunny,9.0,"I saw this excellent Bugs Bunny cartoon as an extra on my blu for 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'. Great fun in its own right, and I enjoyed what Leonard Maltin had to say about it in his introduction on the blu for Warner Bros. 1948 version of Night at the Movies (along with the comedic short film, 'So You Want to Be a Detective')."
148265,Eega,8.0,"I will tell you that we almost turned it off after 10 minutes because it seemed so corny and sophomoric. We couldn't understand why it won so many awards. I'm glad we kept on because once you get past the first 20 minutes, you realize that the whole movie is tongue-in-cheek. And it's absolutely hilarious and fun. Nothing more - don't look for deep meaning here. It's just plain, simple, ridiculous fun."
148514,The Sand Castle,7.0,"Suddenly, a creature with a vague human form springs from the sand... He quickly creates some colleagues and with half a dozen of them - of all shapes and sizes - now milling about, they decide it's time to build themselves homes. Each will be tailored to their unique shape. Nope, the creatures don't all get on, but as we progress their improving constructions skills and their abilities to synchronise with the lively and jolly score become quite entertaining to watch. The use of stop motion techniques to quite literally animate the sand is clever and it's imaginative too."
150117,I Give It a Year,7.0,"Not the best comedy ever but funny and sometimes smart in the good tradition of English humor.

The ending is not round, though. Something doesn't work."
150540,Inside Out,8.0,"Another great movie from Pixar. The story in entangling and is structured in a master way to show us in a nice recreation how the mind works and emotions like sadness are important for a healthy life.

A must to be seen."
150540,Inside Out,6.0,Very interesting idea for a movie. Sadness drives me crazy though. Pretty decent movie though. It's a good family to watch together.
150540,Inside Out,5.0,A fun movie. Not the best but not a bad watch.
150689,Cinderella,6.0,"**Beautiful and bland at the same time.**

The story that's been told 1,000 times. Although this retelling boasts the most impressive costumes and stage design with an excellent cast, there is not much else to set it apart. Everything is familiar, draining some of the magic from this classic story."
150689,Cinderella,6.0,I liked the live version way better then the animation one. Well acted and was surprisingly entertaining.
151330,Heads or Tails,7.0,"For much of its runtime, this movie is tolerable but unexceptional apart from the male nudity. When it escapes its romantic comedy trappings and gets into some psychosexual stuff in the third act, it becomes actually worth watching."
151368,Open Windows,4.0,"**Real-time hacker film that is all style no substance.**

There were so many times I was shaking my head at the sheer stupidity of this film.  The premise is thin, the acting is mostly weak.  There are some kind of cool visuals, but they don't make up for the many, many flaws.  Even the usually solid Elijah Wood seems to be coasting.  Real-time can be exciting, and I get that the style the film makers were going for, but your film still needs to work even if it didn't have the gimmick.  This one does not.

4/10"
151368,Open Windows,6.0,"It's up to Frodo Baggins to save pornstar Sasha Grey!

I didn't realise it was like a found footage film (was bored in most of the film).

But it gets the extra star for that surprising twist!

Plus it featured Elijah Wood from Lord of the Rings and former adult star Sasha Grey in what I assume is her first main role in a mainstream film.
In other words, I'm leaving the three stars as it is."
151380,My Heart of Darkness,10.0,"This is an excellent narrated documentary about 4 ex-soldiers who have fought in the Angolan Civil War in the 80ies on different sides and come together to reflect about that traumatic time.

""There’s no son of any politician or leader that is fighting in war.""

I have to say that I am normally not very interested in documentaries. However, this one is hooking and at least very much completes fictional war movies."
151637,Bhramaram,10.0,"The movie stands with the outstanding performance of ""The Complete Actor"" Mohanlal. He again proves himself why he is the Maestro in Indian Cinema. I had literally no words seeing the climax of this movie.This should be a must watch for all movie-lovers."
152259,Phantom,9.0,"A Soviet nuclear submarine captain is ordered to take a small group of KGB officers on a voyage so they can perform a test of some new technology, highly classified. As the voyage progresses he learns there is more to their mission, the KGB officers are rouge, and the fate of the world hangs in the balance. 
Ed Harris delivers an excellent performance as the captain. David Duchovny plays a KGB officer in charge of the mission. The story was inspired by a real world event, the details of which remain classified."
152584,Blue Is the Warmest Color,7.0,"I became obsessed with Adele Exarchopoulos after seeing this. Didn't even have to look up that spelling. I ordered a custom-made 32"" x 48"" ish sized poster of her for my apartment that's still around somewhere. I'm pretty sure I tried to find her on snapchat. Thanks for reading."
152601,Her,8.0,"This was a really unexpected surprise. The cast is great, specially Joaquim Phoenix, which is a great actor.

The story is simple but well told and the photography, style and design of the movie has been taken into account until the smallest detail. Very well done movie."
152780,The Past,8.0,"An excellent, painstakingly slow, unveiling of dysfunctional characters and their relationships, where no one escapes unscathed. In spite of a few minor lapses, the script, directing and acting are impeccable. My guess is that anyone over 40 has suffered a relationship with some of these people.  I like that Farhadi made no attempt at resolution. In life, there not be. I was completely exhausted by the time the 130 minutes was over."
152790,The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,8.0,"It has beens 7 years since his passing. Suddenly, I felt like watch this film, the final film the late Robin Williams was in. Brought a lot of emotion in me; laughed out loud for most of the scenes, and left with a sad tear at the end.
We still miss you, Robin! 😥"
152795,The Congress,7.0,"It's not bad, but it's not my style. I rate it a 7 for animation"
153158,Underdogs,6.0,"The movie is not bad, good animation, characters, etc. But the script is so predictable."
153518,The Angry Birds Movie,5.0,"**I had no expectations and was still disappointed.**

Not sure what I was expecting from a movie based on a game that consists solely of slingshotting birds at pigs. Unfortunately, the humor was more annoying complaints than clever quips, but it had its moments."
153709,A Hole In My Panty,10.0,"Subarahi!
Films are judged by story, acting, filming/camera and personal taste. In this case, if you like the very best story, incredible heartfelt and natural acting, a committed film crew and a love for the beauty and natural sights of Japan, then here is a movie for you.
Not that well known despite its merits the film goes to the heart of nature and examines the father/daughter relationships, a changing of generations, puberty and the beauty of nature.
It is glorious and a classic for the ages. - XFANSD"
155184,Death Feud,3.0,"On the line of so bad it's good. The entire movie is pretty laughable and at times aimless with some pointless scenes. Stallone, FRANK Stallone and Mitchum, CHRISTOPHER Mitchum, weren't good either though the writing was awful. That said, even watching it alone, I did have a good laugh at least.

As a side, if anyone picks up the Vinegar Syndrome release, the Frank Stallone interview was great, he was honest about how bad the movie was and briefly tells a story about watching it with his brother..."
155346,The Hero's Journey: The World of Joseph Campbell,10.0,This Documentary series is probably the single most important film of our decade. The lessons brought forth by Joseph Campbell have had lasting impact. 
155445,Not All Were Murderers,7.5,"Based on the childhood memories of actor Michael Degen, the movie deals with the everyday struggle to survive as a Jewish boy in Nazi Germany. As his father had died in 1940 after being released from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, Michael and his mother fear to be deported themselves. They manage to live in Berlin with false names and faked papers, hidden by several, often broken, people..."
155940,Forbidden Tales,6.0,"It starts off somewhere in the future (like sci fi), yet it narrates to Medieval times. Weird.
But the sex scenes are amazing though! And it all looks like a made-for-TV movie, if you remove the sex scenes!"
156022,The Equalizer,8.0,"Watched the movie last night, kept me interested although somewhat predictable plot.  Big bad guy, quiet good guy, helpless victims, bad guy gets his.  Overall I did like the movie, but then again I like anything Denzel is in."
156022,The Equalizer,7.0,"Expected pretty good, got very good. Can't call _The Equaliser_ a perfect movie, but I love me a mixed bag of content like this.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
157099,Better Living Through Chemistry,7.0,"A nice little comedy with Sam Rockwell and Michelle Monaghan playing opposite each other as a struggling married couple.

Olivia Wilde enters and 'Bam!', Sam Rockwell all of the sudden turns into a man, wins a bike race, tries to kill Ray Liotta, and wakes up drunk, then stares at Jane Fonda with bleary eyes and tells her he can solve all of her problems."
157336,Interstellar,10.0,"I've got to say I have been wanting to watch this film for a while now and well it's 2021 and it's a Saturday morning and damn, safe to say this is one of the best films I have ever watched in my life. loved everything about It. The creativity and intelligence put into this film is just mind-blowing considering the fact it is a 2014 film. This clearly shows that mankind will one day achieve the most unexpected and unthought discoveries.
Love and respect to the director Christopher Nolan you are a legend."
157336,Interstellar,9.0,"It opens my mind after I watched this movie. I have watched it twice to figure out everything on the movie. Basically, this is the movie talking about earth is not a good place to stay anymore. People have to go to space to find another homeland. It reminds me that we will be like them if we didn't care much on environment"
157350,Divergent,5.0,"Well, it seems we needed a clone of The Hunger Games because, you know, they give too much money to ignore.

Stupid and foreseeable story with the typical action, romance and WTFs moments.

Just ignore the whole saga."
157350,Divergent,2.0,"I decided since this was my mother's 75th birthday to check out the first of the 'Divergent' series, since I love Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd, and Neil Burger's earlier 'Limitless' was intriguing and decent for recent sci-fi. Unfortunately the actors playing the main protagonists and the special effects were atrocious, the paper-thin plot was resoundingly predictable and I couldn't wait till it ended.

Definitely one Burger that was way overdone.

Of course Hollywood garbage like this produces a ton of sequels, while much better and original projects get kicked to the gutter."
157350,Divergent,6.0,A new world order type of movie. With 5 different factions. It was an ok movie but we only really learn about 2 of the factions really in this movie. What about the other 3. It would have been nice if we could see all 5 factions and how they lived and came about but instead you only know 2. So what's the point of even having the other ones in the movie pointless.
157433,Pet Sematary,1.0,"I can see why some people would love this. They took all the story, all the characters, all the depth, and crammed it all into all of five minutes, and then upped the action and violence to 11.

The end result was the remake of a horror movie that had some head to it into a horror movie that you don't really need to pay attention to to follow.

In other words, they made it a mindless, soulless, action packed gory mess... unfortunately action and gore without a plot or characters is pretty boring to watch."
157544,The Vatican Tapes,8.0,"A relatively successful horror film with an interesting story that depicts the arrival and birth of the antichrist.  Of course, this one definitely doesn't belong to the top horror movies, but even so an interesting spectacle that I wasn't bored after a long time.  For those who like various films about exorcism, this film is definitely worth watching.  Don't expect any miracles from this film, but for a good average it will be enough."
157807,Life Begins,7.0,"This film provides a window into life of 1932 as viewed from a higher-risk maternity ward. These were the days when surgery was much more dangerous, where ether ruled and the risk of infection was high (penicillin wasn't in widespread use for another 10 years). The expectant mothers in the ward come from all walks of the working-class life: a woman about to deliver her fifth child, an Italian, a proud ""modern woman"" (single), a nightclub singer and a convicted murderer.

A film worth watching."
157832,Calvary,6.0,"The cast is great. Quite an ensemble with Gleeson delivering yet another fantastic performance. The photography and landscapes are beautiful ... but that's about it.

The movie is quite a mess with no clear story line other than showing a collection of dysfunctional characters. The ending is quite a bluff. It starts strong to dissolve slowly like sugar in coffee."
158015,The Purge,7.0,"It's the basic premise that makes _The Purge_ such a chilling watch and, thought you may see the thrills and scares coming from a mile away, it's the most interesting home-invasion thriller that I've seen in a very long time."
158015,The Purge,3.0,"The core idea of a ""purge"" is interesting, but every single moment of ""horror"" or ""thrill"" in this film is a predictable jumpscare. It takes itself way too seriously and makes some heavy-handed social commentary, while at the same time being really unconvincing and riddled with tropes. Whenever one of the masked villains is on-screen you can count on them to silently tilt their head to the side, playfully skip with a weapon in hand, or giggle about killing.
The main concept and Lena Headey's acting bumped the rating up a little."
158015,The Purge,2.0,"Atrocious directing and cheesy jump scares disguised as nonsensical ""social commentary."""
158445,Miracle in Cell No. 7,8.0,"What a rollercoaster of emotions! It's unlike most movies I've seen, in that you can go from something dreadfully serious, to extremely infantile in the blink of an eye. However, the movie does both well.

Sometimes the moments stretch on, but this probably has more to do with the difference in what korean audiences expect versus the western audience.

Wholeheartedly recommend this movie as something that can be enjoyed with a family or someone who cares about well made movies. The creators absolutely tried to make something special here, and all of the actors did an amazing job."
158455,An Afghan Love Story,8.0,"Very good!

<em>'Wajma'</em>, a.k.a. <em>'An Afghan Love Story'</em>, is a well done flick. Barmak Akram & Co. do a great job at making everything feel real, particularly one scene with Wajma Bahar and Haji Gul Aser - both of whom impress with their performances, especially the former.

Fully merits a viewing."
158513,Tumbling Doll of Flesh,6.0,"At first I thought, ""_well I don't play this movie to see porn._""  
A bit later I thought, ""_I don't think that she signed up for that..._""

I can't say that they did a bad job, but I liked the color scheme 
and faster pacing in guinea pig better. The effects in this are pretty good though.
Not a bad movie if you watch for the effects, but it is pretty slow."
158752,Escape from Tomorrow,2.0,"**Conceptually**, this had a lot going for it. But the actual product is a fucking disaster. _Escape from Tomorrow_ fails in basically every way it possibly could. 

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"
158852,Tomorrowland,7.0,"A mega-grumpy George Cluney is always worth watching. A nice upbeat ""We can change our own future for the better"" movie. It's bright, colourful and inoffensive."
158916,Sweetwater,6.0,"Kind of an odd western. Especially the performance by Ed Harris, who always seems to put his ""all"" into what he doing regardless if it is a little quirky or not. January Jones makes for a great looking avenging angel even if her acting style is a little bland. For fans of westerns it is worth a watch."
158999,Blackfish,9.0,"Great documentary. I had known about Orca attacks in captivity before watching it, but this film really drove home the point. Free Willy!"
158999,Blackfish,9.0,"The dark side of Free Willy. Lately (mid-2023), there have been Orca attacks on boats in the Med. My theory is this: The Orcas are highly intelligent and have a fantastic communication system. The few who eventually were freed from SeaWorld got the word out to all the other Orcas in the world: ""Humans are fucking assholes! Kill the humans!"""
159638,Ghost Team One,2.0,"Just awful watch.

Not only is this mostly boring, there is hardly a movie here.

Following characters dealing with happenstance is very hard to do, and this leans on the ""two guys fighting over a hot chick that won't get with them"" trope way too much.

There just wasn't anything in this for me to enjoy."
159824,Hotel Transylvania 2,7.0,"Not as good as the first, but it was still entertaining and funny. Draculas daughter has a kid with her human husband. The causes all kinds of new problems for Dracula."
159898,The Boxing Cats,6.0,A very early silent film that delivers precisely what it says on the tin. A rather amusing short sequence featuring two cats attired in boxing gloves having a sparring session. It lasts less than a minute and is an engaging example of Thomas Edison's late 19th century moving picture technique.
160588,Blue Jasmine,7.0,"A stunning performance, to be sure, but unfortunately, plagued by the same demons that apparently Woody Allen himself embraces."
161143,Madly Madagascar,6.0,Funny little Madagascar short story. Pretty funny they all catch the love bug. They could have easily made a movie out of this.
161374,Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo,5.0,"Kind of boring creature-attack movie that only has one thing going for it, though would be a big spoiler. This made-for-TV movie was watchable enough and has its moments but I found my mind wandering for most of this. **2.75/5**"
161620,Wonder Woman,4.0,"First adaptation of the comic heroine makes her a superspy rather than a superheroine. Secretary Crosby, working for Garas, overhears that villains have stolen details of agent's identities. She goes on the trail of smooth Prine, working for mysterious Montalban. Ford is a rogue Amazon, in league with Prine.  Crosby eventually appears wearing a demure costume but does not exhibit any great powers. Montalban flees in a dinghy, as she chases him on a motorcycle! A burro figures prominently in the nefarious scheme. The concept would be reworked  to much better effect for the hit series."
161737,Nana to Kaoru: Chapter 2,8.0,"Decent sequel, continuing from where the first film left of. If you've read the mangas, don't get your hopes up, the story changes after the festival. But it's still good as they characters progress as they should. Looking forward to more of these."
161814,Black Widower,10.0,David Lipper's performance is incredible - his portrayal of remorseless sociopath Ed is convincing and unnerving.
162145,The Liability,5.0,"Good concept, half-baked execution.

Tim Roth, Jack O'Connell and Talulah Riley give alright performances, though their characters aren't developed enough to care about nor to be entertained by. There's definitely a good story hidden, though I just didn't really find it interesting. The rushed ending doesn't help, either."
162215,How I Live Now,10.0,ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND STRANGE COMING OF AGE FILMS.  MUST SEE
162618,"Dinosaurs, Dinosaurs, Dinosaurs",8.5,"If you were a kid growing up in the late 80s and early 90s, you may remember these cheesy ""Dinosaur Shows"" that played on the Disney Channel or in your classroom if you had a ""cool"" teacher.  Gary Owens and Eric Boardman provide information on dinosaurs from the time while entertaining us with Eric's antics and Gary's transformation into a real life dinosaur!"
162626,The Skulls,8.0,"This was the Spanish-language experimental re-working of two Laurel and Hardy comedic shorts, 'Be Big!' and 'Laughing Gravy'. From the excellent 'Laurel and Hardy: The Essential Collection: The Sound Films from the Hal Roach Studios', which has 58 of them on 10 DVDs."
163354,Film Noir,7.0,"There's obviously quite a bit of thought, and creative editing, gone into this short feature that celebrates the genre of the film noir by using some original footage, some stop-motion, some photos, posters, toy cars and there's even the odd bit of product placement as the criminals, the detectives and fisticuffs build to quite a thrilling car chase and, of course, a traditional denouement. It doesn't hang about and packs thousands of images, many of them clearly recognisable, into just four minutes that's part homage, part parody and there's Richard Widmark too."
164331,Spiders,4.0,"Spiders 3D, also known as just Spiders, is a 2013 Sci-Fi/Monster movie. The acting is pretty alright, and the story is kinda interesting but also not really. The Queen spider is cool tho. And the CGI isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I think it's slightly below average for me."
164457,Out of the Furnace,8.0,"‘Out of the Furnace’ tells a gripping - although somewhat predictable - story, that focuses mainly on its characters and their emotions, choices and motives. The cast here is truly exceptional, especially Bale and Harrelson, delivering real and raw performances.

8/10"
165740,Pleasure Unwoven,8.0,"We first watched this video as part a health education curriculum. It was a very good explanation of the disease-theory of chemical dependence, I found it explained the processes in the brain involved in addiction in a clear and concise way. All of the students present felt the movie was outstanding."
166424,Fantastic Four,8.0,"I just saw this and I wasn't expecting much as I have read some really negative reviews about it online and elsewhere. Honestly, I think they were wrong. It's not a bad film at all, just not as fast paced as the previous version which I quite liked too ... mind you, I am 60+ so maybe that has something to do with it. A scifi/action film for the older generation perhaps? I really enjoyed it. I gave it 4/5 stars here."
166424,Fantastic Four,8.0,"**Better remake but with unneccessary hate**

Better story than the first film with less of the annoying hollywood romantics. Could do better with the humour.

Accompanied with better graphics too as it's 2015. Of course, the mainstream hate exists because our hollywood world has its dumb morals."
166426,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,10.0,"It was a lot better than the 3rd installment, it was more memorable than the bulk of the 4th...but there are issues.

The charm of the original two is missing and Jack seems worn down and not nearly as much fun as he was in past installments.

He seemed to go from the lovable scoundrel that Forest Gumps his way through the 7 seas, to just, well, to just a drunkard.

Lets hope in the next one we get the charm and fun back, rather than a paint by numbers installment with a less than fun Sparrow."
166426,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.0,Part 5 has Jack Sparrow now on a quest for to find the trident of poseidon. Still a lot of the original crew is missing as well. Still a good movie and lots of crazy scenes.
166428,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,8.0,i got the pleasure of getting a sneak peek of this movie its pretty great i laughed out loud and really had feelings for the characters in this movie its a good choice for older kids i dont think however its a good idea for younger kids its more dark the villans more frightening then before the movie is good very good though
166428,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,5.0,"I feel **veeeeery** much that we've done this dance before now. I definitely didn't hate _The Hidden World_, the animation's pretty speccy, Toothless is eternally adorable, some of the creature design is pretty cool (especially the new bad guy's beasties) and I appreciate ending a franchise on your own terms. But to me, this is still definitely the low point of the trilogy. Not crap, for sure, but hit on a lot of things I genuinely don't care for.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
167032,Curse of Chucky,4.0,"Neither the darker and brutal supernatural slasher of the original _Child's Play_, nor the cheesier and campy fun found in the other two ""_Of Chucky_"" films, so fans hoping for either one of those outcomes will be disappointed. But if you think of it as less a _Child's Play_ film, and look at it for what it really is, a straight-to-video horror, then it's.... Okay I guess?

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
167032,Curse of Chucky,6.0,This was an ok movie. What happened to Tiffany and their kid. There just all of a sudden gone. They established a family in the last sequel to being non existent in this movie.
167079,Windigo,5.5,"Despite it being an amateur movie I found it pretty interesting to watch, it managed to hold my attention until the end of the film. Although during the slow parts, I was still somewhat into the movie by trying to look into the background of the woods and hoped that the Windigo (Slender Man) was standing there acting like a tree."
168098,Cell,3.0,"I've never read _Cell_, so I'm not sure if this is an accurate adaptation of a bad Stephen King book, or just another inaccurate adaptation of a Stephen King book. But either way, it's bad.

For a decent Cusack/Jackson team up in a King adaptation, just watch 1408.

Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible."
168672,American Hustle,8.0,"A very well acted, directed, filmed movie telling an interesting story about terrible terrible people. I didn't like and couldn't root for anyone which /almost/ made me hate the film, but it was so well done and the story was interesting...so 4 stars."
169341,College Humor,8.0,"Not a huge fan of Bing Crosby the person, but I have always liked comedies about college life, and Mary Carlisle, George Burns and Gracie Allen are more than worth the price of admission simply on their own accounts."
169355,Here Is My Heart,8.0,A fun film from a huge (24 film) boxed set of Bing Crosby's movies that I grudgingly go to because of how crappy he supposedly was as a human being. A bizarre plot in which Crosby has to pretend he is a waiter in order to be able to purchase a rare pistol from a Russian princess--who has more than a ruse of her own to show. Enjoyable fluff.
169813,Short Term 12,7.0,"It is one of those films that you really feel for the characters. Its story is very engaging, heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.

I heard a lot about this film before. People kept saying it was one of the best films they have ever seen. While I cannot say the same, it is certainly a film I am glad to have seen now.

Would I watch it again? Probably not, wouldn’t want to stress myself that much again. Would I make my friends watch it? Yes to that."
169865,The Frankenstein Theory,3.0,"Creating the air of mystery around what exactly is responsible for the attacks, and leaving the creature off focus for the whole movie for a shocking final reveal in the last sequence might have been more effective if the damn thing wasn't ALREADY ON THE BLOODY DVD COVER.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._"
169870,The Cure - Curiosa Festival,7.0,A live webcast capturing The Cure's full set of a show from their self curated touring festival.
170234,Faithless,6.0,"Faithless is a much better than average variation of the depression-era standard plot of ""real men don't sponge off of rich wife.""

Socialite Carol Morgan and Bill Wade are deeply in love, but Carol also loves her money and lifestyle and is confident that she will always have them. They part ways and the Great Depression finally wipes out Carol's fortune. What follows is Carol's increasing desperation to live, redeem herself and eventual re-establishment of a relationship with Bill. The path has many struggles."
171424,The Green Inferno,6.0,"Didn't hate but didn't care for it. Acting was pretty bad save for a few scenes by Lorenza Izzo though these characters' naivety were absolutely annoying. As Eli Roth movies go, probably one of his better movies, and yet I'm only giving it a 3/5."
171540,Big Bad Wolves,10.0,"Quentin Tarantino called this the best film of 2013 and it's easy to see why. It's very dark humor with an unpalatable subject, and with the same wry humor as QT. I found it brilliantly put together by the writer/directors and the acting is great. There is no character development which is clearly a choice to keep the audience at a safe distance from the heart of film. I find that to be a very creative choice that allows us to laugh instead of cry. If you're a QT fan, don't miss this gem."
171854,Father's Son,4.0,"A basic film about a self-important father with unrealistic expectations for his 8-year old son. At the end, the father lightens up, the son grows up and the parents grow understand each other better.

There are a few unexpected topics that were touched upon worthy of note: friendship with the black son of a garbage man; playing with guns; and the patriarchy."
172597,After the Curfew,7.5,"Lewat Djam Malam (After the Curfew) is a passionate work looking directly at a crucial moment of conflict in Indonesian history: the aftermath of the four-year Republican revolution which brought an end to Dutch rule. This is a visually and dramatically potent film about anger and disillusionment, about the dream of a new society cheapened and misshapen by government repression on the one hand and bourgeois complacency on the other. - WorldCinemaFoundation.org"
173413,"Don't Worry, I'm a Ghost",4.0,A little contrived and forced just for the sake of getting to the big reveal moment.
173897,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.0,"Some cool ideas but Anderson brings a new level of visual incoherence to the action scenes that is confounding and irritating rather than thrilling. It's as if he hasn't watched a single action movie in the last decade.

Not to mention so many stupid jump scares I had to wonder if he was trying to get a job with Blumhouse.

Still, Milla Jovovitch retains a steely charisma that remains compelling, but deserves far better material. Hopefully with this being the 'final' film she will be free to go and find it."
173897,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,6.0,"For the final chapter, Alice has escaped to racoon city. Now the umbrella company is going to try to take down the last safe haven they have."
174011,Groucho: A Life in Revue,7.5,"Watching Frank Ferrante become Groucho Marx was an amazing experience, especially for old and crotchety Marx Bros. fans like I am. I was worried that he was going to come across with a stereotyped Groucho impression, the kind you might see Bugs Bunny do, or even Alan Alda's (or, rather, Hawkeye Pierce's) impersonation on M*A*S*H*. You know who they're parodying, but it's not really Groucho. Ferrante, however, captures so many of Groucho's mannerisms and speech habits, from subtle eye rolls to sly grins at the audience, that you soon forget you're watching an impersonation. It's a masterful performance."
174340,Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic,6.0,"Being a fan of Pryor's live work, I picked up a few releases, this being one of them. It's the story of Richard from friends and family that knew him. From his childhood to first concerts, movies. Omit the logic is a great title considering that he set himself on fire and goes way beyond rational explanation. I'm sure he was troubled soul like a lot of comedians and tries to show how and why of Richards life"
174675,The Machine,3.0,"A disaster ... the effects are good, but the plot is very **forced** and closed ... very trite the subject of AI that becomes human ... there are other titles even recent that far exceed it, starting with ""Yo Robot"" (_to which does not even reach the heels_)!"
174751,Jane Got a Gun,2.0,Jane has got a gun. Great then maybe she can use it to put those of us that took the time to watch this movie out of our misery. Not a good western at all as Portman is poorly cast as Jane. Boring and slow which are bad things when watching a western. Because when done right they can be a very exciting movie expierience.
174751,Jane Got a Gun,4.0,"The Western genre is one that has struggled to find its own two feet to stand on in recent years. _Jane Got a Gun_ certainly does not buck that trend. Also I'm pretty sure not a single one of these Wild West folks was American.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
176513,Piravi,8.5,"**Piravi is a father's LOVE,sister WEEP,mother's HOPE.Raghu haunts you with shades of desire even after. One of the best movies i have seen.
A Must must watch from Shaji N. Karun.**"
177077,Kisses for Breakfast,5.0,"A fun, silly flick that we are happy to suspend disbelief and go for the fun ride. Under other less skilled actors and direction this would be a dreadful flop, but here the execution is nearly flawless."
177221,The Battery,5.0,"Not at all what I was expecting. All of its shortcomings are completely understandable (though it does still have them).

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
177436,A Man to Remember,6.0,"A satisfying story about a physician who serves humanity in spite of it not being very profitable. He witnesses greed, vanity and corruption in the ""respectable"" citizens of his town. Despite being poor, shattered dreams and being cheated, he is rewarded at the end, if perhaps in a small way."
177436,A Man to Remember,6.0,"A satisfying story about a physician who serves humanity in spite of it not being very profitable. He witnesses greed, vanity and corruption in the ""respectable"" citizens of his town. Despite being poor, shattered dreams and being cheated, he is rewarded at the end, if perhaps in a small way."
177677,Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.0,"Everything you can expect from a ""Mission: Impossible"" movie. The script is not the brightest nor the freshest but works OK. Cruise, Pegg and Rhames keep the franchise afloat while Renner and Baldwin feel unneeded.

Great addition with Ferguson. She takes most of the attention in this movie.

Good work from the direction."
178015,Strip for Action,6.0,"So this was the 3rd movie that was made with recycled material from the hidden gem that was Naked Obsession...

.... only this time you don't get Dan Golden directing it, and it shows. It doesn't have the same ""I can be competent in the B Movie genre"" that the other ones have.

And instead of getting a decent B-Movie that falls into the ""Stripper Exploitation"" category, you get kind of a crap one with Maria Ford acting as the only redeeming quality."
178935,Carolina Blues,5.0,"A fairly standard WW-II, war-bond film involving a big-band leader falling in love with a singer. A pleasant,light-hearted watch with comedy relief."
179144,The Great Beauty,8.0,"Mesmerizing movie staging a decadent and beautiful Rome for a decadent character and greatly played by Toni Servillo. Great cast, nice decadent story and, overally, huge directing by Paolo Sorrentino."
179375,Red Wine,8.0,"Red Wine is a clean investigation story.It's a good thriller.
It is a good Love story also.It is a clean entertainer and have no confusing twists and stunt sequences.
The story is telling through an investigation of murder of a young politician Anoop(Fahad Fazil).
Its a varaity method of story telling...
it is a watchable movie.
Rate :3.5/5"
179826,Odd Thomas,8.0,"For me, this has to be the best film featuring the late Anton Yelchin.
RIP"
180296,They Came Together,6.0,"""_I have watched many, many of Molly's boyfriends bend my wife over that sideboard and flunk the hell out of this test!_""

The humor in this is so random that you would think that it is a remake of a Shakespeare story but with half the cast of Wet Hot American Summer and I am here for it. Bring back random dumb humor!"
180299,The Raid 2,10.0,"The Raid 2 is more ambitious than the original, with a more complex story and some of the best choreographed and directed action sequences ever made. What more could a hardcore action fan ask for?"
180299,The Raid 2,7.0,"A lot more involved than the original _Raid_ film, with a more complex story taking place over more time and in more places. Sounds great, but I think the smaller, contained tale of the original actually served the premise better. But make no mistake, _The Raid 2_ is **awesome**. It provokes more discussion than the original, and the fight scenes (which let's be honest, is 100% the reason we're all here) are **absolutely** up to specs.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
180352,Asia's Titanic,9.0,"Great Documentary. However, I can’t help but feel that this is one of the most horrific, devastating, and tragic of peacetime maritime tragedies to have occurred surpassing the RMS TITANIC. The MV DONA PAZ tragedy had taken the lives along with those of the oil tanker MT Vector: 4,386 dead, and 27 survived. I won’t ever forget that night recorded: December 20, 1987.
RIP."
180403,Now I'll Tell,5.0,"Based on the life of Arnold Rothstein, sports gangster, supposedly written by his wife. Tracy Is energetic and wily, with Twelvetrees as his long-suffering wife. Faye scores as his bit on the side and she gets to sing one song. Temple is in one short scene."
180856,King's Faith,10.0,This is the kind of movie that gives you hope. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
181472,The Second November,7.0,"An interesting film that is based on Albania gaining independence.

It's the plot that very much carries this 1982 production, with all intrigue coming from it. Don't get me wrong all of the onscreen talent are good, but I wouldn't say anyone particularly stands out above their respective co-stars - perhaps with the exception of Sandër Prosi.

It's a story-driven 80 or so minutes and it's an 80 or so minutes that I had a positive time with. 3* for <em>'The Second November'</em> from me."
181808,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,2.0,"Really disappointing. Our heroes of Star Wars have essentially wasted their lives and achieved nothing. 

We were promised sequels and got a retread. I for one would have loved to see the building of the Galactic Republic against terrorists of the Imperial Remnant. Instead, we got Failure Luke, Failure Leah, gone nowhere Chewie and a rebel alliance that appeared to entirely fail to do anything meaningful after episode 6. 

I actually have less difficulty accepting 1,2 and 3 into canon then I do this pap. My headcanon has already decided, these movies do not count."
181808,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,1.0,"The last jedi is clearly the last SW movie I`ll ever see. Everything was bad. Story, casting, acting, CGI, everything..  I just want my 2 hours back.. please.."
181812,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,9.0,"Went to the first showing in town tonight.  I really enjoyed the film.  Although it leaned heavy on nostalgia, it should, since it is wrapping up 40 years.  I did not care for The Last Jedi, and was worried going in.  Will do a deeper dive after I have seen it a few times."
181812,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,1.0,"Bad. Everytime i watched Star Wars, i regret. So much hype."
181965,The Brotherhood IV: the Complex,3.0,"The least contemptible entry in the Brotherhood series, Complex, while not good, is at least watchable. It has a coherent plot, non-glacial pacing, and there's just enough skin and homoeroticism, filmed just well enough, that you might get some mild titillation out of it. For whatever reason, director David Decoteau actually made an effort this time.

If you intend to watch a Brotherhood movie, or more generally a David Decoteau product, make it this one."
182469,"Tangos, the Exile of Gardel",8.0,"Very nice and interesting movie, it mixes tango with the nostalgic feeling endured by those who are living in exile. A must see."
183662,Crush,5.0,"I was surprised by how much I didn't hate this honestly. Sarah Bolger was **genuinely** engaging which I did not expect to get out of something with a logline like the one _Crush_ has. I think I'd have to re-watch it to make sure the third act really tracks. But even though I did enjoy it, I don't think I enjoyed it enough to re-watch it ever, let alone right away for the purposes of a single six-line Letterboxd review. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
184315,Hercules,6.0,"Of course, not the best movie but the cast is well chosen and delivers a good performance.

The intention is no more than doing an entertaining action movie, maybe a bit too violent for all audiences.

In any case, the fresh approach is to show a down to earth Hercules, not a demigod, but the actual product of the marketing for creating a hero and become a legend when centuries have past. Just for this it deserves some recognition."
184551,Into Your Dance,7.0,"This was a decent early colour Friz Freleng cartoon that was an extra on my 'Annie Oakley' DVD from my Barbara Stanwyck TCM 4-pack. Not essential viewing by any stretch of the imagination, mind you, but definitely worth a watch. Most of it is about an amateur night talent show, a precursor of the contemporary 'Gong Show' that I watched as a child, back in the day. Worth investigating for the adventurous animation aficionados out there."
184887,Ferrailles,7.0,"I really quite enjoyed this. Ir's a bit like the animator has gone to town in a Meccano museum or a junk shop - and the visuals are intricate and cleverly merged to create robotic and characterful real-form metallic shapes using nuts and bolts, wires, cogs and parts from old engines. Initially, it looks conceptually abstract but then develops more recognisable creatures and in the end has an almost familial feel to it - complete with it's own form of tin-tantrum. Quirky. I liked it."
185267,The Human Race,4.0,"_Death Race_ meets that one episode of _Community_ where they take ""The Floor Is Lava"" really seriously. Except not as good as either.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
185399,The Crunch Bird,6.0,"A woman with a wonderfully full head of red hair has to buy her indulgent husband a birthday gift. She shuns the traditional sporting and gadget ones and alights on a pet shop where she buys him a very rare ""crunch bird"". He gets home, not exactly in the birthday mood after a day of paying her bills, and discovers his new friend. His words of welcome could have been better chosen. You see, he isn't aware of the trigger phrase! It's short and succinct and I quite enjoyed it."
185465,Manito,6.0,"Meh, overkill on the stereotypes, machismo and ever present empowerment from saying ""fuck"". Predictable all the way through although Manny's situation at the end is easily the best part of this average movie, I give it an extra star for that. Overall weak FM release."
