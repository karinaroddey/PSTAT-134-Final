5055,Ashes and Diamonds,8.0,"There are so many great things about how this movie is made - the directing, the shots, the tonal quality, and the pacing. Probably most brilliant of all is how the total makes the viewer feel claustophobic. I admit, though, it's a tad dated."

5055,Ashes and Diamonds,7.0,"My first Wajda and I really enjoyed it. I thought that Cybulski's performance was great and I loved the scene in the pub where he's lighting vodka shots, which he plays perfectly. The shots of him through the patterned staircase looked amazing in black and white, and especially because of his sunglasses. I did get a bit lost in the politics side of the plot but despite that I didn't get bored and I really liked the romance plot line and the sequence with the drunk secretary. I thought the blood coming through the sheet at the end was a really strong image and the final shot of him running through that kind of wasteland area was a great ending 3.5/5"
5082,La compagna di viaggio,,"This Italian erotic comedy from director Ferdinando Baldi takes place almost entirely on a train! 
Sexual tensions erupt in tight quarters and the female cast tries unsuccessfully to remain clothed in this rare European drool-fest. 
And what a cast!! Annie Belle, Anna Maria Rizzoli, Marisa Mell, 
Marina Hedman(Marina Frajese) and Moana Pozzi (Anna Maria Pozzi) 
all have their turns at shedding their clothes; however, it’s 
newcomer Serena Grandi (making her second film appearance) who 
steals the show as a young soon-to-be-wed virgin who finds herself 
in a compromising situation with the wrong man."
5121,The Sugarland Express,6.0,"Steven Spielberg's first proper cinema movie has some great photography from Vilmos Zsigmond.

The tone is uncertain. A road movie, a tragic comedy with car pile ups that is based on true facts.

Lou Jean Sparrow Poplin (Goldie Hawn) takes her husband Clovis (William Atherton) out of a minimum security prison just weeks before his eventual release.

All to save their child who has been taken away and ready to put up for adoption. They kidnap a police officer which leads to them being pursued by the police and the media.

Goldie Hawn is spiky as Lou Jean but she is also stupidly impulsive.

A story that needed more work, Spielberg does make an accomplished film."
5156,Bicycle Thieves,7.0,"When in Rome... keep an eye on your bicycle! Or else it might be stolen and you'll find yourself fruitlessly searching the streets of Italy, as the father and son do in this classic Italian film.  Lamberto Maggiorani, as the desperate, out of work father, and Enzo Staiola, as his frustrated young son, play off each other nicely and a nice pace keeps things interesting. It's heralded as one of the greatest movies ever made, but personally I don't quite see why. It's a good story none the less, and it kept my attention. There's a very satisfying dose of irony at the end."
5174,Rush Hour 3,2.0,"Arguably works as an example of the sort of red flags one might want to look out for if they suspect that a film's director is (like Brett Ratner) a sex offender.

But as a movie? Nah, not so much.

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"
5175,Rush Hour 2,4.0,"Didn't know I had a favourite _Rush Hour_ movie until today. I guess I do, and it's this one. Still pretty crap though.

_Final rating:★★ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._"
5175,Rush Hour 2,1.0,"OK, for those of you who, like me, liked Rush Hour, do yourselves a favor and stay away from this.

What we have here is basically Lethal Weapon 4 set in Hong Kong rather than LA. And... it just doesn't work.

Everything (save the stars) that made the first one funny is kind of out of place and forgotten. It's horrible. The fish out of water scenario fits well in Rush Hour, but set in Hong Kong, Tucker comes across as obnoxious instead of funny.

It's horrible."
5176,3:10 to Yuma,10.0,"Most of the time I hate remakes....but I give a big pass to most Western and War movie remakes.

Mainly that's because, until M*A*S*H early war movies had soldiers that looked like they stepped out of the shower and put on a freshly laundered uniform...you know, instead of the realities of life in combat zones.

And the same goes with Westerns, the cowpokes may be riding the range...yet they look like they had the time to shower, shave, style their hair, and press their clothes.

None of that really sat right with me...at all.

The remake righted that wrong.

And it did it without killing the wonderful Elmore Leonard story the movie was based on and let's be honest, he really has the best ideas for crime and western stories the world has ever seen."
5176,3:10 to Yuma,7.0,"First off this film is a remake of the 1957 film of the same name.

Casting couldn't have been better for the main characters. The R rating and amount of violence was perfect for the tone of the film. The ending was exactly what the film needed. Not some soft, heroes win feeling most films carry nowadays. One of my favorite films."
5178,The Good Heart,,"Brian Cox is excellent! As the characters transition and grow during the movie, you will laugh and cry."
5236,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,7.0,"Funny story, tailored for Robert Downey Jr. with a superlative Michelle Monaghan. Val Kilmer shines like in movies some years ago."
5236,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,8.0,"Probably the best thing Shane Black's ever made, and I do not say that lightly, even the worst things he's behind have been okay, and the great (like _Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_) are truly great. The movie that turned me on to lead man Robert Downey Jr., but it's Val Kilmer that steals the show here.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
5236,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,10.0,"Awesome movie, if you liked The Nice Guys (2016) you're going to love this."
5236,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,6.0,"**Kiss Kiss Bang Bang’s excellent acting, script, and writing are held back by its annoying and avoidable language and nudity.**

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a clever and unique mystery movie with brilliant writing, dialogue, and acting weighed down by unnecessary and excessive language and nudity. Seriously, I would love this movie if you cut out all the f-bombs and nakedness. Robert Downey Jr. basically auditions for Iron Man with his manic and witty performance, and his unlikely friendship with Val Kilmer’s character is highly entertaining and hilarious. Characters break the fourth wall several times throughout, keeping the movie comical and fresh. I really wanted to like this movie more, but the crass language and needless nudity hold Kiss Kiss Bang Bang back from being a holiday regular."
5255,The Polar Express,10.0,"No matter how many times I watch this, it always brought me to tears!

I only wish that I got to see it in 3D at the cinema."
5257,The Dish,8.0,"I may have watched this Aussie film much closer to when it came out, since 	 have always like Sam Neill, but I had no memory of it and we gave it a look. It is very entertaining in a quiet way. The bursts of humor are short, occasional and subtle, and it works.

Of course it is based on actual events and feature a few news archive clips as well as actors playing historical characters, sometimes almost as a cameo.

It features some restrained tension and suspense as the crew at the telescope try to live up to their commitment to passing audio and video from the moon landing on to NASA and the world. Among the supporting cast we also have a radical political daughter and a clumsy young couple trying to initiate a new romance. It all adds flavor to the main plot."
5259,The Band's Visit,7.0,"Some touching moments and a few amusing ones. Less than 90 minute film went by quickly, I wish the ending had been longer.Ronit Elkabetz is ravishing. Uneven but overall pretty good film."
5279,Gosford Park,6.0,"6/10 Good acting and a solid plot for a murder mystery, but has at least 20-30 minutes of scenes that could have been trimmed, esp as it takes 90min for the murder to occur.  I had figured out the key points and was falling asleep at the end...I'm still tired now, writing this."
5336,"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom",7.0,"Wow! You can't escape the fact that this movie pushes the limits of disturbing art! Many will call it sick. I suspect the point of this film is more about the depravity and dehumanization of fascism, political corruption, totalitarianism, and morality. I have not read the Marquis de Sade's work on which this film was based.

**It isn't possible to ""un-see"" a film, so be prepared if you choose the experience.** It was described to me as ""horror"" before I watched it, and I'm not sure it truly captures the film's genre. I can't think of a film genre that adequately describes it.

I will probably never watch it again or forget the images it seared on my brain. But I was challenged to think about various political and societal themes that are still very relevant today."
5375,Fred Claus,4.0,"Decent watch at best, probably won't watch again, but can recommend for off-brand holiday movies.

While I like watching Vince Vaughn beat up Santa Claus as much as the next person, I'm not a big Vince Vaughn fan.  I'd rather see what Paul Giamotti can do with the Santa role, honestly.

Kevin Spacey, being very much himself, is awful, or his character is, and a story needs a good villain.  Being a whiny spoiled kid in an adult body doesn't really do it for me, especially in a Santa setting."
5458,Cruel Intentions 2,5.0,No where close to being as good as the first. Seemed liked they tried way to hard to make it like and better then the first. They failed miserably.
5460,Cruel Intentions 3,5.0,Not that bad of a movie. No relation whatsoever to the others. They just mess with couples lives and feelings. They are pretty cruel.
5471,Beowulf & Grendel,5.0,"Not a bad little piece, but sort of out of its time. If it wasn't for the cast (and what a cast) I would have assumed this movie was made at least a decade earlier than it actually was. The dialogue's mix of contemporary and faux medieval was also particularly odd, and the effects were... I don't want to say bad... But, again, seems like the sort of quality that might have come about in the early 90s more than mid 00s.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
5492,Gunner,3.0,"""Gunner"" has a lot of flaws, including questionable music choices, iffy CGI effects, and reliance on typical action film tropes. However, it still delivers an old-school black ops thriller. Luke Hemsworth shines as the action hero. That being said, only watch if you have 90 min of your time to waste ..."
5492,Gunner,6.0,"It was quite decent movie. Had some flaws with weird music that didn't fit the movie and not very realistic scenes few times, but overall I enjoyed watching it."
5506,The Ladykillers,9.0,"A film of real quality!

<em>'The Ladykillers'</em> is amusing viewing. It's style of comedy is very fitting of its era, but I only mean that positively as the slapstick is undoubtedly fun to watch unfold. The cast are all worthy of a mention, though the standouts for me are Alec Guinness, Herbert Lom and Katie Johnson. The flick looks splendid too, love the set of Wilberforce's home.

Entertainment from start to finish, ya can't ask for more than that."
5511,Le Samouraï,,"Amazing movie! Withstood the test of times. Was watching it with a great interest unlike many movies of this era. Delon is magnifique! Unexpected plot and ending, but the title should have prepared me for it."
5548,RoboCop,8.0,"Ahhh, 1987, what a year for cinema. Not the least of which is Paul Verhoeven's incredible feat of practical effects engineering: _RoboCop_. This is one of those older movies where I can totally confirm for you, my love for it is in no way rooted in nostalgia. I didn't watch _RoboCop_ for the first time until 2013, when I was starting up my third decade of life. It's a phenomenal example of the period, but its also a great movie on its own.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
5548,RoboCop,9.0,"Seen this several times over the years and still holds up well, story and satire wise, though certainly some of the effects were dated (in particular the death of one character falling out a window). Other than that, an entertaining and bloody 1980s action-thriller, where the sequels and a remake, and certainly the third entry, could not touch. Would like to think the proposed RoboCop Returns will succeed where other failed, but don't hold out much hope. **4.25/5**"
5549,RoboCop 2,6.0,"It's not so much that it's terrible, it's just that it's disappointing after the immeasurable success of the original movie.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
5549,RoboCop 2,9.0,"The first thing anyone can say about this movie, and should say, is that it isn't RoboCop. But that should be said for all reviews for all movies always. Yet, this is still one of the best sequels ever put together to any movie anywhere at any time. Weller is outstanding again. How can stuffing a man into a foam latex suit and have him clip clop around in front of a camera work so well? Its mind blowing."
5550,RoboCop 3,4.0,"_RoboCop 2_ might pale in comparison to the original, but _RoboCop 3_ is the sequel that's genuinely bad.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
5550,RoboCop 3,4.0,"This certainly is not RoboCop and its not even RoboCop2, its, sad to say, RoboCop3. An embarrassment for everyone involved. It is the same level of failure as the third Mad Max movie, where he goes off to play with kids in the desert and then Tina Turner does a little dance or something. He has a jet pack in this one, idiotic. Fourteen thumbs down."
5551,Space Cowboys,7.0,"Something just doesn't quite feel right about <em>'Space Cowboys'</em>.

It's good, but it always feels like it's stuck in second gear to me. I was anticipating more based on the cast, but even they are a little underwhelming. it's relative to what I was expecting, as Eastwood is still solid, Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland too, and the plot is satisfactory; even if I would've shaved off 15-25 minutes. An interesting piece of casting, btw, is the film debut of one Jon Hamm.

Borderline forgettable, but nothing bad. It narrowly gets a 3* rating from yours truly."
5590,Donkey Skin,9.0,"A beautiful and stunning work, from both the acting primes of Catherine Deneuve, Jean Marais and Delphine Seyrig, and the directorial prime of Jacques Demy. One of the most exquisite and memorable transfers of a children's fable to the big screen."
5595,Fermat's Room,7.0,"Fermat's Room is a Spanish language film (set in Spain) in the same genre of films as the Cube series. A small group of people end up stuck in a shrinking room and the only way to avoid being crushed is to answer a series of riddles.

This movie is a fine example of one of my favorite movie types; characters end up stuck somewhere not knowing who put them there or how to get out but without the gore of the Saw series. It's well acted. It's well worth watching."
5636,Treasure of Silver Lake,6.0,"If it were not for the terrible dubbing and the overpowering score that sounded more suitable for a ""Tarzan"" film, this would actually have made quite decent western. Lex Barker and his ""magic silver stick"" with his blood brother Apache ""Winnetou"" (Pierre Brice) have some quite exciting escapades as they try to thwart Herbert Lom (""The Colonel"") and his seemingly never-ending army of men who are on the search for the eponymous treasure. It's a colourful adventure story with plenty of gunfights, a mini siege and, of course, plenty of rough and tumble. Made for the German market, which explains the rather quirky inclusion of a German aristocratic butterfly hunter, it has some a rather stilted, almost academic, script; it lacks vernacular and that can render it ridiculous at times, but it's still a decent effort from a nation not known for exploration into the Wild West."
5680,Elvira: Mistress of the Dark,6.0,"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark is a hilariously campy comedy that doesn’t take itself seriously, and that’s what makes it so much fun. Cassandra Peterson shines as Elvira, delivering sharp one-liners and an unapologetically bold performance that carries the film.

The story of Elvira shaking up a small conservative town is filled with outrageous humor, cheesy effects, and a good-hearted message about staying true to yourself. It’s silly, self-aware, and endlessly entertaining. Perfect for anyone looking for a lighthearted, laugh-out-loud good time."
5689,The Blue Lagoon,5.0,"The film starts out with a pretty good plot and storyline, but as the film continues, it just seems to drag on. It needed to move at a quicker pace, or modify the storyline to keep the watchers attention and interest. I’ve seen it all the way through once(1x), after that I always leave the movie 50-75% complete. 

> **RATING: _2.5_ / 5**"
5698,The Great Train Robbery,6.0,"Firstly, I feel honoured to be the first to write a review for this prestigious short; secondly, I found it to be… good. I can’t claim any more than that, though it is heavily influential. The narrative is unlike many other short, silent films as it actually sucks you in until that fantastic final shot. But was it perfection? No. Is it worth watching? Of course, I’m sure any of my fellow cinephiles can waste ten minutes for this cinematic curio."
5825,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,7.0,"<em>'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'</em>, unlike predecessor <em>'National Lampoon’s European Vacation'</em>, is more akin to the original. A good watch it is, if still off from the first flick. The festive vibes are there, it's perhaps a bit too mean-spirited at times but overall works.

The cast are the cast, I don't think anyone stands out as being a great performer but they are all satisfactory. Chevy Chase is the obvious lead, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't rank his performance as anything overly higher than his co-stars. Interesting to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus appear, by the way.

All in all, there's enough there to entertain. The ending is suitably watchable, which is something I did feel was missing from the previous film."
5852,Angel Eyes,4.0,"Movie was good. Kept me interested throughout the movie, but the ending was dumb. It ruined the whole movie."
5910,Fireworks,7.0,"There's greatness in there, for sure, but <em>'Fireworks'</em> (or, the better title, <em>'Hana-bi'</em>) drags on for too long.

I was with it for the first 45-55 minutes, but the final portion of the film really dragged for me; aside from a few moments, it kinda just repeats the same sorta scenes over and over. Like, personally, I got it... needed a bit more to it, in my opinion.

There are some very good performances, no doubt. Takeshi Kitano is the obvious star of the show, though I was also impressed by Ren Osugi - who is just as excellent as the aforementioned writer, producer and director of this 1997 flick. The support cast are solid, while everything onscreen looks neat too.

I did like this overall, but I can't say it hit me as much as it evidently has for others. Worth a watch, either way."
5924,Papillon,9.0,"Although present for much of the filming, author Henri Charriere didn't live to see the release of PAPILLON (1973), which was based on his allegedly autobiographical novel. The veracity of what he recounts has been questioned virtually since the books' release in 1969, and the film takes further liberties, leaving one to wonder if this adventure picture is more fiction than fact. What one doesn't have to wonder about, however, are the results achieved by an underrated director at the top of his craft; a bracing Jerry Goldsmith score; marvelous cinematography by Fred Koenekamp; and spot-on performances by Steve McQueen, Dustin Hoffman, and a stellar supporting cast which features some of the best character actors of the period."
6037,Murder by Death,4.0,"A playful parody chock full of casual cruelty, misogyny, ableism, and racism. There is sincerely funny stuff here, but you’ll need to sit through a _lot_ of junk to see it."
6037,Murder by Death,10.0,"A movie from a time when people were not so easily offended. Lots of fun humor and laughs to be had if you sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is, a comedy from the 70s."
6056,Lord Edgware Dies,6.0,"Austin Trevor dons his best Belgian accent as ""Hercule Poirot"", the famous detective here called in to investigate the fatal stabbing of the wealthy Lord Edgware (CV France). It doesn't take us long to discover that his wife (Jane Carr) was seeking a divorce so she could marry the ""Duke of Merton"" (Esme Percy) - could that be a motive? Well he and Scotland Yard's finest ""Inspector Japp"" (John Turnbull) must find out. It moves along nicely, this, and is fairly faithful to Agatha Christie's original story. Sure, Austin Trevor's persona takes a bit of getting used to and the style of the production is very stage bound, but it is still quite an engaging budget murder mystery, with some decent acting efforts that I quite enjoyed."
6073,The Mexican,9.0,"Silly entertainment!

<em>'The Mexican'</em> works as a comedy and works as an adventure road trip flick, so it evidently achieved what it set out to do. This 2001 release features a strong cast, as we get Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts together alongside James Gandolfini, J. K. Simmons and Gene Hackman. I enjoyed all five, especially the first three.

It's not a film to be taken overly serious, it's one to enjoy and I got a lot of enjoyment from it - credit to Gore Verbinski & Co. Recommended? Definitely!"
6073,The Mexican,9.0,"It’s been a while since I’ve seen this and maybe my tastes may have evolved but I recall liking it a lot and watching it a second time at one point. I was pleasantly surprised by James Gandolfini’s brave choice of his small role, after the tough gangster roles. I would watch it again just for that. I would recommend this move to anyone looking for a nice early 2000’s romantic comedy."
6114,Bram Stoker's Dracula,,"This Seductive, Thrilling, love story has some Bite! Based from the book and is a true masterpiece. Gary Oldman plays Dracula and simply makes this movie. His obsession with Winona Ryder characters is relentless and heart chilling. Don't worry Keanu Reeves doesn't ruin it, he actually did a great job. Anthony Hopkins plays the role of Dr. Van Helsing. We all know his story now thanks to Hugh Jackman. Some brief nudity and a HOT scene with Winona as she runs though the garden in her PJ's. Not only do I gave Bram Stoker's Dracula 5 stars, BUT I rate it in my Top 10 all-time. MUST SEE!"
6114,Bram Stoker's Dracula,8.0,"The script is an unevenly good adaptation of the novel. It resolves better Dracula's aims and motivations through the love story.  Also, it provides a more understandable glue to join the 4 men chasing Dracula from a XXth century point of view and removes unimportant characters having a more ""round"" story.

However, due to some changes certain parts are now incoherent since they were not properly adapted to the other changes. In addition, other parts are totally impossible to follow due to the amount of details only commented quickly along the movie.

Costumes and general artistic work is superb but it drives the movie to some extreme stravaganza that, in the case of the actors' performances make some parts of the movie completely overacted.

In any case, I think this is an iconic movie worth watching more than once."
6114,Bram Stoker's Dracula,9.0,"Although it certainly won't make you easily forget earlier interpretations of the seminal horrific character by Max Schreck, Bela Lugosi, Sir Christopher Lee or Klaus Kinski, Gary Oldman definitely finds a way under your skin. As well, the resoundingly sumptuous cinematography will sweep you off your feet--unless you're dead to begin with... =)"
6280,Junior,6.0,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

If for nothing else, then you should watch this because this is ""the movie where the guy is pregnant"", but I'm not sure we need a reboot: one is probably enough.

It helps that this is a good movie with a great cast.  I felt bad they made Danny Devito run so much, but Arnold is great as a pregnant man, and sometimes a woman, and Emma Thompson does a wonderful absent-minded professor.

It's a unique premise, it's a good premise, and for a comedy without lasers, aliens, or explosions, there is a lot of excitement.

Give it a watch, it's all about the execution that makes this one great."
6282,Coyote Ugly,8.0,"<em>'Coyote Ugly'</em> is solid cheese and I'm here for it. There's nothing all that noteworthy to say about this, you'll either enjoy it or you won't; I doubt there's much middle ground. For me, it works. It's well paced and well acted, the music is well chosen too - s/o LeAnn Rimes.

I'm pretty sure I've seen this before when I was younger, so long ago that I hadn't had it logged on here. I can't say I totally remembered it whilst watching, though many of the scenes did feel familiar and I recalled the main cast. Speaking of which, Piper Perabo is good as lead. Maria Bello, John Goodman and Adam Garcia are also solid.

Just discovered that this has the same director as Kangaroo Jack. David McNally really made these two classics and ducked out of the industry, what a rockstar."
6341,Blue Thunder,8.0,"A comedic movie that screams 80s from the rooftops, and it works incredibly smoothly. This is First Blood, but with a helicopter. "
6393,Taking Care of Business,,"Originally released as Filofax it took me a while to find this movie with it's rerelease name of Taking Care of Business.
Well worth the search though. One of James (Jim) Belushi's best films along with The Principal.
I remember watching the TimeCode VHS (I worked in a video rental shop) about 2 months before it was released on VHS.
Still a brilliant movie & even my 14 year old son enjoyed it so stands the test of time well
If you like a bit of light hearted comedy with a great actors then I definitely recomend this movie"
6396,SLC Punk,8.0,"Maybe _SLC Punk_ isn't exactly an accurate portrayal of my life in alternative culture, Hell, maybe it isn't exactly an accurate portrayal of **anyone's** life in alternative culture, but seeing a movie where people belonging to alternative culture are actually **characters**? That was a massive deal to me growing up, and this alone would make me a fan of _SLC Punk_, but even aside from that there is its unique filming style, solid acting presence and intense philospohical questions to push it over the line into worthwhile.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
6415,Three Kings,,"A very good movie, based on true events. It's good to see some real humanity still exist today."
6415,Three Kings,6.0,"_Three Kings_ is not my usual sort of thing, I watched it on the suggestion of a complete stranger, and I don't know that I'll ever watch it again. But I **do** think that it's a good movie, so I'm going to pass that buck and say, that those of you who like me had never seen this nearly twenty year old movie, give it a chance.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
6435,Practical Magic,4.0,"Genuinely one of the most bizarre films I have ever seen in my entire life. I am at such a complete and total loss on _Practical Magic_. I might have genuinely thought I'd fallen asleep and dreamt half a different movie if it wasn't for the fact that I watched it with my roommate and she had the exact same nonsensical experience as I. 

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
6443,The Forest for the Trees,6.0,Easy to identify with Melanie and the end was moving but much of the film is uninvolved and lightweight.
6466,Freddy vs. Jason,7.0,"I don't think I can go so far as to call _Freddy vs. Jason_ good. But I can still be honest about the fact that I love it. Considering it mad-grabs the humour from both its delivering franchises late-stage entries, with the bizarre, ethereal yet quippy flavour of _Elm Street_, and the body count of a _Friday the 13th_, how could I not?

Crappy acting, unbelievable SFX, hack script, completely disrespectful to the canon of both parents, yet eminently re-watchable for any occasion.  

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"

6466,Freddy vs. Jason,10.0,I was so excited to hear this movie coming out. It didn't disappoint. My two greatest horror killers of all time battling each other. Love this movie.

6470,Fire Birds,4.0,"**A miserably bungled Top Gun impersonation with helicopters… why?**

Lame Top Gun with helicopters. Almost everything is a straight rip-off. Nic Cage is a much more exaggerated Maverick. Tommy Lee Jones fills the Viper role. Flight school. Overly cocky pilots. Contentious playful romance. Fire Birds so closely replicated Top Gun that it forced a comparison that Fire Birds lost miserably. The cheese factor was cringe. The soundtrack was nowhere near the quality of Harold Faltermeyer’s anthem. David Green couldn’t measure up to Tony Scott’s directing mastery. Even with some of the 90s’ bigger stars, Fire Birds couldn’t burn bright."
6471,The Jerk,7.0,"***Steve Martin’s breakout comedy***

A homeless mentally-challenged man (Steve Martin) shares his amusing tale of rags-to-riches-to-hobo with flashbacks. Catlin Adams plays a stunt rider at a carnival who has the hots for Navin (Martin) while Bernadette Peters plays a more important woman in his life.

“The Jerk” (1979) has several laugh-out-loud scenes like the eventual confrontation between Patty (Catlin) and Marie (Peters), but there are also some flat, overlong parts, like when Navin departs the mansion in the last act. “Forrest Gump” (1994) was obviously inspired by “The Jerk” and made a more serious, popular picture. Jim Carrey also took a lot of inspiration from Martin and “The Jerk” to forge the even funnier “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” (1994).   

The movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

GRADE: B"
6472,Guarding Tess,6.0,"Shirley MacLaine (""Tess"") is on good form in this rather daft tale of a pretty cantankerous former First Lady who has a running battle with her Secret Service agent Nicolas Cage (""Doug"") as he tries to keep her within his security protocols - an exasperating task that is mostly an uphill struggle. A series of fun face-offs ensue as she and her team - chef Richard Griffiths and chauffeur Austin Pendleton run the poor old Cage ragged before, unexpectedly, she goes and gets herself into a bit of bother that mobilises just about the entire nation. ""Tess"" has got some good one-liners and there is a fair amount of chemistry between the pair as their love/hate relationship begins to pan out in this quite watchable comedy drama."
6474,Navajo Joe,7.0,"OK spaghetti from Corbucci but far from his best. Reynolds looks like a primitive with that forehead and hair. Aldo Sambrell excellent as ""Duncan"". Nicoletta beautiful and talentless as always. The ending had good and not so good moments, the final scene corny."
6477,Alvin and the Chipmunks,6.0,"Als Kind habe ich die Zeichentrickserie von Alvin und die Chipmunks geliebt um den Animations-/Realfilmmix habe ich nach den schlechten Erfahrungen mit ähnlichen Filmen biser einen Bogen gemacht. Zu Unrech! Natürlich ist Alvin und die Chipmunks kein Meisterwerk. Natürlich präsentiert der Film keine komplexe Story. Und dennoch hat der Film mir Spaß gemacht. Die animierten Chipmunks fügen sich gut in den Film ein und „Earl“ Jason Lee weiß prima mit ihren zu agieren. Wenn die Chipmunks Chaos in der Wohnung von Lees Filmfigur Dave stiften oder ihren ersten großen Auftritt haben, dann schwingt natürlich ein Stück Kindheitserinnerung mit, aber ein Stück Kindheitserinnerung, die mit diesem Film angemessen in die Neuzeit transportiert wurde. Alvin und die Chipmunks ist somit seichte Unterhaltung, wenn es einfach mal ein relaxter Couchtag werden soll. [Sneakfilm.de]"
6477,Alvin and the Chipmunks,8.0,Love this movie. Kind of funny and cute to see these little hairy beasts singing pop songs. At least the songs weren't bad.
6479,I Am Legend,1.0,"Oh this one just hurts. I mean, shout out to Will Smith. In 2022 he might be a beta fool, but he was still charming as all get out in this movie.

It just wasn't what it was supposed to be.

The source material was pretty amazing. Richard Matheson was on a pretty high horse when he wrote it and it came out as a pretty philosophical masterpiece in the way that only science fiction can.

It examined something and then it took that examination and turned it into a story... like science fiction should.

But ""I Am Legend"" just sort of examines Will Smith and the philosophical musings that made the source material great took a back seat to special effects and monsters and Smith.

It could have been something that people are still talking about instead of something people forgot."
6479,I Am Legend,8.0,Awesome movie! See kind of what life would be if you were the last one on it. The problem is battling the evil that took over.
6522,Life,8.0,"Really funny, messed up and kind of sad. Back in like the 1930's getting charged for a murder they didn't commit. They get life, and spend life trying to figure out how to get out."
6557,27 Dresses,8.0,"This is such a girly movie, but I can't lie I actually like this movie. I love the"
6637,National Treasure: Book of Secrets,7.0,"Well, what do you know, a sequel that's pretty much the same story as the original. But so what? This movie isn't as good as the first but it's just as enjoyable. So let's get on board and find some treasure. Just one thing, can someone explain to me why Nicolas Cage got so loud in this one?"
6687,TransSiberian,5.0,"Another excellent Woody Harrelson performance. Otherwise, not really worth a watch."
6723,The Rookie,10.0,"There is a movie with James Woods that I keep mistaking for this one.  

Anyway, it falls under the ""What did you expect?"" category of flick.  It's not good... it's not bad either.  No one expected it to be a box office bomb, no one expected it to be the next big thing either.

They set out to make a fun and entertaining throw away cop movie and that was exactly what they ended up making, a fun and entertaining action flick.

And that is all it is, something to like and throw away, so it did it's job."
6844,The Ten Commandments,,"(The King of Egypt - with his sword drawn - and his Queen, together, converse about killing Moses, servant of the Most High God) ...

Queen Nefretiri: 'Bring it back to me, stained with his blood!'

Pharoah Rameses: 'I will... to mingle with your own!'


Inspired by the Book of Exodus, this Cecil B. DeMille-directed, Academy Award-winning biblical epic, the seventh most successful film of all-time, needs no further analysis.

Among the undisputed, where exceptionally classic one-liners are concerned, The Ten Commandments is a timeless generational masterpiece, and a National Film Registry-honored landmark of the Hollywood cinema industry ... Period.

Five out of five glittering stars."
6844,The Ten Commandments,,"As good today as in 1956

This film consists of an all star cast and is an amazing movie. The special effects are incredible especially for 1956. The acting is clearly amazing in this account of Moses and the Ten Commandments. 9-10"
6844,The Ten Commandments,7.0,"Until very recently, I had never actually made it all the way through this Cecil B. De Mille marathon. It is a glorious piece of cinema but no amount of beautiful colour and costumes can detract from what is really rather a staid, over-egged production. Sir Cedric Hardwicke helps open the proceedings as Seti, but once he has gone the film loses much of it's class and just becomes a vehicle for Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner to play Moses and Ramses as this overly scripted tale of frail brotherly love becomes enmity and ultimately open hostility. Edward G. Robinson and Vincent Price present us with a bit of menace; the special effects are cleverly applied - giving the plagues an extra bit of potency and Elmer Bernstein provides a strong score but basically this is just one long story more of biblical, than, epic proportions."
6877,Failure to Launch,7.0,"A simply OK film, though the last 20/30 minutes or so does drag a tad.

Matthew McConaughey is good, Sarah Jessica Parker is good, the support cast (which includes an early role of Bradley Cooper's) are good. I didn't overly enjoy what I was watching, but I wasn't particularly bored with it either. I don't really have much to say about it in truth.

At around 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome. That makes it a watchable, if slightly forgettable, flick from 2006 in my books."
6917,The Gate,6.0,"Not too shabby.

Stephen Dorff is one of my favorites (in a long list of favorites mind you but one of my favorites none the less) so it was interesting to see him as a child in this one. 

He's pretty good no Elijah Wood in his age or anything but perfectly decent for the lead in this.

It's a bit on the slow side but it's got some cool ideas and if I saw it as a kid I'm sure I'd appreciate it even more, might even been scary to me back then cause even though the cast are mostly kids it is rather dark in tone and manages to not feel too cheesy.

I (re?)watched Critters some weeks ago and I didn't think it held up very well in 2017 but this one did just fine."
6933,One Missed Call,7.0,"Good movie. I hear a lot of bad things about this movie, but I don't understand why. I thought it was a pretty good movie. Any one would be scared if this happened to them."
6974,The Angry Red Planet,3.0,"Pretty hysterical story of two surviving astronauts returning to Earth, and one recounting their adventures on Mars. To call this film sexist would be an understatement, the science and technology onboard the spacecraft is hilarious- yes, that is a manual typewriter, but the film's one saving grace is the bizarre special camera effect of the surface of the red planet.  

(Unrated)- Mild physical violence, very mild gun violence, some tobacco use."
6977,No Country for Old Men,9.0,"I literally liked the Movie. Its story is outstanding and innovative. However, I wish the ending was more of action scenes than dialogues. 
Not to forget that Javier Barden's acting is breathtaking and marvelous. His smile 4:49 is petrifying!"
6977,No Country for Old Men,8.0,"Only the second time seeing this but this is a well done western-drama with amazing performances, most notably Javier Bardem and to a lesser extent, Josh Brolin. I don't think it's a great movie especially compared to a movie like Hell or High Water, but still highly entertaining. **3.75/5**"
6978,Big Trouble in Little China,6.0,"_Big Trouble in Little China_ is not the movie it is marketed to be. But it is good. You wait the ten minutes it takes for the absurdity to kick in and then you ride the ridiculous ride until the closing credits.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
6978,Big Trouble in Little China,7.0,"Enjoyable enough adventure flick with another charismatic performance from Kurt Russell. The plot certainly felt disjointed at times (and one sequence didn't really advance the plot all that much) but still had a lot of fun. Not one of Carpenter's best nor a standout amongst 1980s movies, however still liked it well enough. **3.5/5**"
7012,The Day After,9.0,"This was solid and, considering its epoch, scary. I remember being a teen when this came up, and with U.S./Soviet relations at a nadir, nuclear war films were just starting to appear on the cinephile's radar once again, after taking a breather from their 60's heyday for the sake of the glut of natural disaster films that hit theatres in the interim.

This was one of the first and best, simply because director Nicholas Meyer was so good at sci-fi. I fervently wish he had made a lot more movies."
7012,The Day After,7.0,"James Robards is exceptional in this sad nuclear holocaust fable, made for TV but a top notch production in most all respects."
7091,Vampire's Kiss,7.0,"Finally got around to watching this after seeing so many memes and clips over the years. Nicolas Cage is at his weirdest for sure but so much fun in his over-the-top performance. Oh, and it's always great seeing Jennifer Beals, especially playing a vampiress (well, kind of). As a whole, not sure if this is brilliantly insane or insanely brilliant, either way I don't think I'll ever forget this one... **3.5/5**"
7131,Van Helsing,6.0,"Sorry, but this is just all over the place. A potpourri of myths and legends loosely connected with the famous vampire hunter that just don't gel at all. Doctor Jekyll, Mr Hyde, Victor Frankenstein and his monster all vie with Count Dracula for the attention of a really rather lacklustre Hugh Jackman in the title role. Kate Beckinsale sort-of recreates her ""Underworld"" role as she becomes his kick-ass sidekick. It's fairly action-packed but the scenes go on for far too long, the script is cheesy, the CGI just isn't great and the attempts at humour don't work well either."
7214,Coach Carter,7.0,"**Coach Carter allows its powerful true story to shine through Samuel Jackson’s performance and the focus on the lives of the young men Coach Carter coached.**

Coach Carter is the inspiring true story of a coach that cared much more about the lives and future of his players than winning a game. Samuel Jackson was the perfect choice to play no-nonsense but compassionate Coach Ken Carter that believed in his players while holding them to standards that changed their lives. While the movie is about basketball, the focus is much more on the relationships and development of its characters. The actual basketball scenes of the movie are decent but less compelling than the rest of the story. Coach Carter is an excellent film for those that want to see how their choices and willingness to fight compromise can change the lives of others."
7219,Zombie Flesh Eaters,10.0,"in my opinion, quite simply the best CLASSIC zombie movie ever made"
7220,The Punisher,3.0,"Thomas Jane and John Travolta are good in this, but man is The Punisher one stupid movie.

I'm willing to suspend my disbelief quite a bit but how is it a gangster assassin doesn't double tap and headshot their target when they have them at point blank? This mafia family soon proves to be one of the dumbest in all of gangster cinema, leaving their loved ones completely open to be followed by Frank Castle, falling for a really terrible manipulation scheme, and how did they find out where Frank Castle's apartment was?

This is the kind of try-hard movie that Hollywood makes every so often when they have a revenge story script, an alpha-male protagonist, and all the rights to heavy metal tracks. It tries so hard to be cool and fails so spectacularly it's actually painful to watch."
7227,Airport '77,6.0,"Gets a little slow in the third act during the scuba rescue part but picks up a bit and finishes well enough. Having now seen three of these, while far from great, I'm a sucker for the Airport movies, as preposterous as they can be at times. **3.0/5**"
7249,Futurama: Bender's Big Score,6.0,"Probably the strongest of the _Futurama_ films. Is a pretty neat self-contained story, but works best as a part of the whole, offering some solace to long-time fans.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
7295,8MM 2,4.0,No where close to how good the 1st one was. They got way to sadistic on this movie. It's pretty much a porno!
7299,Equilibrium,8.0,"So there's a pretty decent chance that _Equilibrium_ doesn't have an original bone in its entire makeup, but I still just **love **it.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
7303,Maid in Manhattan,6.0,"Ok movie, this is probably every maids dream. To meet a handsome rich man that will sweep her off her feet."
7340,Carrie,,"Carrie had been included on a list of great films to which my mother had taken my older brother and me to see upon their theatrical releases decades ago. And the memories of that long ago time will forever remain with me. Back when the Chicago Theater had still been a movie house, Carrie was the first film that my family and I had gone out on our weekly ""Movie Date Night"" to see. Good times. Gooood times. Carrie is an undisputed horror masterpiece. I still...get chills."
7340,Carrie,7.0,"Sissy Spacek is really good in this as the socially inept, psychologically tortured, girl living in the shadow of her overbearingly Christian mother, with few friends and some remarkable telekinetic powers. What ensues is a complex, at times convoluted, angst-ridden horror film that sees the best and worst of human nature - of all ages - depicted, as thoughtless pranks and humiliation become the order of the day with some chilling consequences. Piper Laurie is superb as the zealot mother, as is John Travolta as the odious ""Billy"" and the combination of Brian de Palma and Stephen King make for a compelling, multi-layered critique on many different aspects of intimidation, bullying as well as adding some genuinely scary moments too!"
7345,There Will Be Blood,,"Great movie, not a spaghetti western. Very good story and atmosphere 10 stars."
7345,There Will Be Blood,10.0,"A hypnotic flight into the darkness of the soul and how people hide themselves away. A masterfully directed feat, There Will Be Blood shows the very limits of selfishness and greed which are further encapsulated by Day-Lewis’ mind-blowing and unique performance of which could be easily called the greatest of all time. Every person who worked on this seem as if they are masters of their crafts, even the child actors, whose performances are stunning. Day-Lewis has excellent chemistry with Paul Dano’s egoistical preacher, who was very much snubbed for the best actor category. With some of the best cinematography ever brought to film, this is truly one of the all time greats."
7347,Elite Squad,7.0,"Decent movie with lots of strongly violent action. It stands up because it is staged in Rio and created by Brazilians.

The plot is not very surprising but good enough."
7347,Elite Squad,,"**As a brazilian, i can approve this movie as relatable**

As a brazilian, this movie i can agree with. I love the drama, the action parts are good. But best of all, THE POLICE. In Rio de Janeiro, there are favelas that have drugs. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS RUN BY CORRUPTION AND GREED. If you are portuguese, download the app called Globo and read the news. There are a bunch of cartels, gangs, and worst of all: MAFIAS. They've spread to the U.S. In Brazil, you cant trust the police, nor the government. The president of Brazil (bolconario or whatever his name is) got arrested for corruption because he stole from the government! This movie is relatable."
7348,Robinson Crusoe on Mars,7.0,"Batman dies.
But he dies early in this film, so that isn't a spoiler.
This is one of those ""think piece sci-fi"" films from the sixties and seventies. It's sort of a sister piece to films like ""Silent Running"", ""The Andromeda Strain"", and a few others that go more into psychology than action.
Still, there is action, or at least the semblance of action due to smart writing and directing.
An astronaut finds himself alone on Mars after Batman dies. Okay, it isn't Batman, but it is Adam West.
We're wondering if he is imagining the strange things going on, or if they're real. And there are strange things happening.
And those ""strange things"" get wilder and wilder and more sinister, but is this a dying man's last dream? Or is it real? We're left with believing it is real."
7443,Chicken Run,9.0,"A guilty pleasure for me personally, as I love both 'The Great Escape' and most of the works I have seen, over the years, from this rightfully-esteemed British animation company. Highly recommended both for children and for adults who enjoy animation."
7443,Chicken Run,6.0,"Made my roommate who hates stop-motion animation watched this in 2018 and even he had a good time. It's maybe not as great as I remember thinking it was when I was a little kid, but it still holds up to some degree.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
7443,Chicken Run,8.0,"A very good stop-motion animation!

<em>'Chicken Run'</em>, which I watched a crap tonne when I was little but not for a vast number of years now, is an impressive production given it came out in 2000. Despite a pretty simple feel to the film, it's a very well developed concept.

The, admittedly short, run time truly flies by. Of course everything looks, relatively, terrific, but I'm impressed by the pacing which is clean. As for the cast, Julia Sawalha is the definite standout - she's fantastic as Ginger. Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels, as rats Nick and Fetcher, are amusing. Mel Gibson (Rocky), though still decent, isn't actually that good in this.

A fun and interesting story! Definitely worth seeing if you haven't already. I'm intrigued to see where they go with the upcoming sequel."
7445,Brothers,4.0,"One of those films where once again there is a huge difference between the critics' and the viewers' assessment. Which one will you choose?

In the genre of war films, I'm slowly leaning towards the critic. In 'Brothers' each of the characters seems overdrawn to me. No one reveals anything surprising, everyone fulfills their cliché. The story strictly follows the black and white stereotype of the situation in Afghanistan, completely disregarding being coherent. A Marine has been missing for less than a year and his family is already living 3 chapters after that?

If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie - because it underscores all the clichés you're promised in a good 2 hours. On a positive note, it has become a fast paced piece of work. But I got about as excited by the production as I did watching campfire TV at night."
7445,Brothers,4.0,I don't know what the point of this movie is. Just a guy who's crazy from ptsd. There's no point to the movie at all.
7446,Tropic Thunder,8.0,"Still as funny as the first time I saw this, probably way back in 2008. Good send-up on war movies and just great comedic performances all around, but especially Robert Downey Jr. **3.75/5**"
7452,"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover",9.0,"Having previously watched Greenaway's 'Prospero's Books', basically from the same era, one definitely gets a sense of the auteur, of great visualizing prowess in the Welsh native. I adore watching Helen Mirren from ANY era, but particularly here, in between the young adulthood beauty she displayed in Michael Powell's 'Age of Consent', through the remarkably absurd and audacious 'Caligula', straight to the sophisticated and very dangerous gorgeousness displayed in 'The Comfort of Strangers'.

It's great to see any dude who's mean to a beautiful woman get their comeuppance (particularly the wealthy--it offers a sort of 'wish fulfillment' for the 99% of us), and the climax here is one of cinema's most articulate presentation of that phenomenon. It definitely made me wish to see the rest of both Greenaway's movies and of Mirren's performances. Well worth the acquired taste necessary for this sort of delicacy."
7453,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,,"Just read the Book, it's so much better. If you have read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy there is a series to read, get to it!"
7454,The Bunker,5.0,"Maybe not the strongest example of this sort of thing, but certainly a watchable entry into the ""Supernatural shit happens in an underground Nazi bunker"" subgenre which very clearly exists.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
7457,Alpha Dog,,"OK Timberlake fans and haters alike, Calm Down! Largely regarded as ""you know, that movie with Timberlake in it."" Alpha Dog was enjoyable. And Timberlake did a great job. He is definitely all grown up now. A strong supporting cast of Sharon Stone and Bruce Willis sure didn't hurt. I loved how the cast worked so good together. They were very believable. The movie did a great job of showing us just how crazy and out of control a simple misunderstanding can get. Hopeful Hollywood does force Ben Foster down our throat! Small doses please! NOTE: Alpha Dog has a lot of language in it."
7461,Vantage Point,7.0,"Decent if not also contrived quasi-political thriller (the politics of it is rather thin and safe, so neither side will be offended) with each segment were okay though the Forest Whitaker one was the most ridiculous. Also not sure if there was meant to be one with the news team, and Sigourney Weaver's talent was utterly wasted.

All that said, the stunt and car chase sequences in the final act was great and a good choice more or less having Dennis Quaid being the lead of the ensemble. This probably makes for a fine weekend viewing even if the pacing, that is the jumping from one POV to the other, never quite worked but still found it entertaining. **3.5/5**"
7485,Shooter,8.0,"All around solid action-thriller with Mark Wahlberg in his element. Luis Guzman served as a fun sidekick and Kate Mara is a stunner. Shame this didn't do better at the box office, would've liked to have a sequel instead of that USA Network TV show... **3.75/5**"
7485,Shooter,,"Excellent movie with major stars like Mark Wahlberg and Danny Glover. An expert marksman living in exile, is coaxed back into action after learning of a plot to kill the president. Now on the run after being double crossed by a shadow government operation. Have watched multiple times!"
7507,The Specialists,7.0,"Above average spaghetti. great cinematography and camerawork in the Italian Alps, refreshing change from the Tabernas Desert in Spain. Some plot elements don't work and the ending is too reminiscent of ""A Fistful of Dollars"" which lowers it to a 3.5 instead of 4. Gotta love ""El Diablo"" though!"
7516,Smokin' Aces,7.0,"I don't think I can tell you that _Smokin' Aces_ is **good**. But I have seen the movie on three seperate occasions in the past thirteen years, roughly evenly spread apart. And each time I have not only enjoyed it, I enjoyed it more than the last time. This movie is **very** dumb. But fast and fun and oh boy what a cast.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
7516,Smokin' Aces,6.0,"Sometimes wild, sometimes confusing action-thriller that boasts a great cast, but in the end, this wasn't a Carnahan movie that really did it for me. **2.75/5**"
7551,Déjà Vu,7.0,"Pacing could've been better but still an effective sci-fi thriller thanks to Denzel Washington's charisma carrying over the finish line. Even though this was my third viewing, first time in at least a decade, my feelings and rating remains the same. **3.5/5**"
7551,Déjà Vu,8.0,"Déjà Vu is a compelling blend of science fiction and action, showcasing Denzel Washington's exceptional talent. His portrayal of ATF agent Doug Carlin is both engaging and nuanced, bringing depth to the character. The film's production is noteworthy, with director Tony Scott utilizing advanced visual effects to create a seamless narrative that explores complex themes of time and memory.

The cinematography by Paul Cameron effectively captures the vibrant essence of New Orleans, adding a rich backdrop to the unfolding mystery. Washington's subtle humor, particularly the quip about the ""seven dwarves,"" adds a light touch to the intense storyline. Jim Caviezel delivers a strong performance as the antagonist, contributing to the film's tension and depth.

Overall, Déjà Vu is a well-crafted film that combines innovative storytelling with strong performances, making it a memorable addition to the genre."
7552,Fun with Dick and Jane,6.0,Interesting movie. It's a shame that there's lives got ruined. This what they resorted to. Different type of roll to see Jim Carey in.
7553,Waiting...,8.0,"Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.

Granted it's a little raunchy, but it should be somewhat relatable to everyone.

This joins a movies like ""Clerks"" (basically any Kevin Smith movie), and ""The Concessionaires Must Die"" for it's fantastic dialogue and interesting characters.  Even if they're not ""good"" characters, each character has their own little gimmick that this awesome cast brings to life.

Not everyone can be Ryan Reynolds, Justin Long, Anna Faris or Luis Guzmán, but it all comes down to each and everyone's stellar delivery with the multitude of stories happening on top of each other.

The movie is very funny with deep thoughts sewn into it, mostly life philosophy."
7555,Rambo,9.0,"Kick-ass action all around and although the story is on the basic side and has minimal character development for Rambo himself, just a bloody, albeit too much of it CGI'd, entertaining especially an action-fest finale. Amazing, especially being the fourth entry into the series."
7737,Resident Evil: Extinction,5.0,"I suppose a bit better than Apocalypse as it feels a bit more mainstreamed in the plot and action, still not great but some of the fight sequences were okay and has some semblance of interesting ideas and I still like Jovovich in the role even if she's not the strongest actress, but does have some screen presence in this sort of movie. Being so short, you don't get to know Ali Larter's character all that well and felt odd that Jill (Sienna Guillory) and Angie's (Sophie Vavasseur) absences weren't mentioned (that I can remember). **2.5/5**"
7737,Resident Evil: Extinction,8.0,"**Overall : The final horror-focused entry of the franchise with high stakes and some great new characters.**

The third movie in the Resident Evil franchise and the beginning slide into outright sci-fi action. Most of this entry focuses on survivors attempting to withstand the dangers of a zombie-filled apocalyptic desert. Unfortunately, umbrella’s experiments on Alice have results that sometimes become the focus and begin dragging the franchise further from survival horror. I enjoyed this entry with the addition of Claire Redfield from the games, the return of Carlos Olivera, and the hopelessness of the deadly sun-scorched wasteland continually claiming the lives of the struggling survivors. But Alice’s superpowers distract from the core of what makes this franchise great: surviving zombie horror."
7737,Resident Evil: Extinction,6.0,This one is kind of boring till you get to the end. They try to stop the umbrella company from infecting everyone in world. Also try to save Alice while being experienmented on.
7737,Resident Evil: Extinction,8.0,"Resident Evil: Extinction is a must-watch. The movie follows Alice as she navigates a desert wasteland, battling mutated zombies and discovering the shocking truth of Umbrella’s experiments. The action is relentless, the stakes keep rising, and by the end, Alice uncovers an army of her own clones, setting up an epic fight against Umbrella. With a gritty, Mad Max-style atmosphere, this film delivers on thrills and suspense. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi and horror!"
7839,Wedding Daze,6.0,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

If you like either Jason Biggs or Isla Fisher, then this is a lot of that: a lot of abusive humor to Jason Biggs and a lot of Isla Fisher being quirky but pretty.

The premise of being married too soon combined with traumatic experiences is fun, and everyone in the cast is good, but it's only so good.

It's nice to see modern day fables though where communication is necessary for happiness."
7840,"10,000 BC",4.0,"""Epic"" in so much as Emmerich films always are, but that's not to be confused with ""good"". If you want to learn something true, or feel an emotion, look elsewhere. But if poking a mammoth with a stick is more your thing, you could probably handle _10,000 B.C._

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
7913,Rang De Basanti,,"One of the best Bollywood movie of 2006. A must watch for Bollywood fans. The performances are top notch, the soundtrack is great, the visuals are iconic."
7980,The Lovely Bones,,"This was a very good movie.  I never heard of this movie so i was watching my tv,lazy day so i left this on  my tv and i was really interesting movie.   I will give a 9 out of 10"
7980,The Lovely Bones,,"Without the rape, from the book, the movie loses all potency and gravitas. In what universe is there a Pro-Harvey/childraping/murderer?"
8012,Get Shorty,1.0,"You know what, I really love Elmore Leonard, and a part of me feels that nearly any movie made from his works is going to come out as fresh, original, and worth watching.

This is the rare exception.

Here they took a classic Elmore Leonard plot and made it too Hollywood for its own good. And then they tried a bit hard to make it too much like a Pulp Fiction film, but with less bleak comedy and more slapstick comedy.

You still have Leonard's unique originality...but the story has been raped and what's left is trash."
8016,"Germany, Year Zero",9.0,"What an awful position the despicable Nazis left their descendants at the close of the Second World War. Rossellini has the perfect, objective, almost documentarian painterly hand in his depiction of this, and I have the feeling that only someone from one of the losing Axis countries, such as he, could so astutely and profoundly bring across such a feeling of loss and guilt that haunted these 'survivors'. A very sad film to watch, yet at the very same time necessary and healing. Clearly my favourite of his works, next to his magnificent 'The Flowers of St. Francis'."
8016,"Germany, Year Zero",7.0,"Edmund Moeschke (""Edmund"") is superb in this gritty and authentic looking post-war story of a young boy struggling, with his family, to make ends meet in Berlin after the fall of the Nazis. Scrounging, scrimping, scavenging - all to try and keep his ailing father and the rest of his family fed and warm. It is tightly cast and the scenarios - filmed just three years after the allies reduced much of the city to rubble are very poignant; the photography and sparing dialogue all lend well to the gently accumulating sense of desperation that culminates in tragedy. The children bring optimism and hope to the story - their innocence writ large as they embark on a new life for them as did the rest of Europe in 1948. Well worth a watch."
8043,Breakheart Pass,8.0,"Really solid western-thriller with Charles Bronson in his element as usual with movies like these. Features a nice supporting cast that includes Richard Crenna, Charles Durning, Ben Johnson and Jill Ireland. Just an all around entertaining film from beginning to end. **3.75/5**"
8051,Punch-Drunk Love,2.0,This has to be one of the dumbest and worse movies I have ever seen from Adam Sandler. I don't get this movie or what the point of it is at all. Watched it 3 times and it still makes no sense.
8054,The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,7.0,"The fantasy element was great. I wish I could live in this fantasy world. It was exceptional and very wonderful. I watched the movie twice. The first time, I didn't understand the movie well and didn't like it. I did not know whether I liked the movie or not, but when I watched it again, I was fascinated and inspired by the wide imagination element that exists within the scenario.

The character of Lily Cole was amazing, she is incredibly beautiful and I have to show respect for Heath Ledger's performance and Tom Waits gave an amazing performance. Christopher Plummer stole the show with a controlled, professional performance

The animation element wasn't well managed, it could have been shown better the way it was."
8055,The Reader,4.0,"I didn't turn this movie off after the beautiful sex scenes only because two others were watching it with me. The mere fact that ""Germans"" were speaking English totally destroyed the whole ""suspend disbelief"" for me. This film is an awful rendition by Brits of an award-winning German book. Perhaps, only someone from the Nachgeborenen (to coin Bertolt Brecht's meaning of German post-Holocaust generations) should have made this film. The two stars are for Winslet and Kross. The rest sucks."
8065,21,7.0,"**21 intrigues with a fascinating true story, fast pace, and fun characters.**

21 entertains with its fast-paced story based on the real-life account of the MIT Blackjack Team, who tried their hand at counting cards in Vegas and won big. While 21 is not groundbreaking in its storytelling or execution, it's a fun and enjoyable film with a good twist and likable characters. This film sets itself apart from a typical heist movie in that card counting is not technically illegal. The characters weren't trying to escape police but casino enforcers with brass knuckles and examples to make. This relatively unknown cast surprised with its solid performances boosted by the film's great pacing and exciting story."
8068,Desperado,9.0,"This was a solid and highly enjoyable take on the spaghetti western by Rodriguez that rightfully put the director on the map and provided star Antonio Banderas the breakthrough he needed in the American marketplace. Though I love his work on the Sin City films, particularly the first, his incredible earlier trilogy will always hold a special place in my cinephilic heart.

My recent project of coming to terms with classic Westerns has only further helped me enjoy these more recent contemporary releases."
8069,Barbarella,6.0,"Got the new Arrow Video 4K release and decided to give this another watch. Still not great but lots of fun to watch and of course Jane Fonda was sexy as hell. Wouldn't mind seeing the novel getting another adaptation, I can see someone like Edgar Wright giving it a shot (perhaps with Ana de Armas in the lead). **3.0/5**"
8077,Alien³,6.0,"Aliens, a great action movie, cheapened the original by replacing one hyper-intelligent, indestructible monster with an army of gormless critters. This third entry has only one creature, but unfortunately it's just as gormless. When Ripley (Weaver) crash-lands on a prison planet full of hard-nut slap-heads, they haven't seen a woman in years. Discovering that there's an alien loose, Ripley asks the warden to break out the guns, and can't believe it when she is told there aren't any. Nor can we. Good acting has salvaged many a poor script in the past, but not here. Dance is slaughtered in the first act, as is the regulation bastard warden (Glover), leaving only Sigourney, impressive as ever, and a motley cast of extras. Though wasteful of the expensive sets, Fincher's tight close-ups do add to the sense of claustrophobic panic."
8077,Alien³,9.0,"**Superior in every department to the basic shoot em up, Aliens,** 

Alien 3 returns the franchise to its artistic horror roots established by Ridley Scott. No more Disney kids, happy endings and machine gun wielding irritants.

This movie is a beautifully bleak experience and is the true sequel to Alien (1979). Performances are excellent all round - especially Charles Dance as prison doctor, Clemens, and, of course, Sigourney Weaver - who gives us her best performance as the downtrodden Ripley.

A masterwork by David Fincher that restores the horror and dignity to the series. Thank goodness for Alien 3! 

- Charles Dance"
8077,Alien³,7.0,"Did Gordon Ramsay direct this? F-bombs galore!

Sigourney Weaver remains a joy to watch, while Charles S. Dutton and Charles Dance are strong additions; Dutton especially. As for other positives, I enjoyed the score and the fact that we (seemed to) get way more of the alien itself; which is what I wanted from the first two, personally.

The plot isn't the greatest but is very watchable, the ending is pretty good. One criticism I do have is the dialogue, as alluded to at the top of my review. I've nothing against the use of swear words whatsoever, but man does this film overuse the f-word; it feels like every other word across the conclusion.

Overall, it's a definite drop down from the two very good predecessors, though I still got the required entertainment from <em>'Alien³'</em>. A noteworthy directorial film debut for David Fincher."
8078,Alien Resurrection,5.0,"A pretty average movie, specially compared to the previous installments in the Alien franchise (even Alien 3). The plot sometimes gets very confusing and none of the characters are memorable. Some of them are even rather cartoonish. The movie seems like a cheat attempt at cash crab, by using a known franchise. I would recommend watching if you are a fan or are looking for a mediocre action/horror movie to watch with friends."
8078,Alien Resurrection,8.0,"Super fun!

I wasn't expecting <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> to come out better than <em>'Alien³'</em>. Sure, this 1997 flick isn't as great as <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> but I honestly wouldn't put it that far off. I really enjoyed it, cracking action coupled with a great cast.

Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley is a pleasure as always, meanwhile this is the most I enjoyed a support cast from the franchise. Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, Brad Dourif, Raymond Cruz, Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott all have positive moments.

Not the franchise's best, yet arguably its most entertaining. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
8080,Suspect Zero,4.0,"Don't remember when I last saw this, but probably was when it was released on DVD. So this is my second viewing and don't remember a whole lot but my rating pretty remained the same. It's unnecessarily confusing but worse, rather dull for the bulk with good actors like Aaron Eckhart and Ben Kingsley not being able to breathe life into boring script. Had potential perhaps under a more experienced director but as it is, this is one I won't revisit for a third time... **2.0/5**"
8090,Untraceable,,"A terrible movie that is full of cruelty. The problem of cyber crime is never relevant in our time. This cannot but scare. I am glad that I am using the Utopia P2P application, which allows me to keep my data safe."
8130,Desperately Seeking Susan,10.0,I always thought this was one of Madonna's best film performance yet.
8193,Napoleon Dynamite,6.0,"Original, unique, bizarre, hilarious!

* I love all the whacky and authentic and heartwarming characters from this movie.
* I think it has a kind of bedroom pop vibe to it. Alot of bedroom pop music videos look and feel similar with the fashion and ideas they riff on. 
* I love the environment they're in. Wide open, sparse midwestern town. The American landscape is big and cool.
* This movie is a brilliant example that art doesn't need a huge budget to transcend mediocrity."
8195,Ronin,5.0,"**A little boring with a great car chase scene.**

Even though Ronin had shootouts, great chase sequences, and classic actors, I was bored and on my phone throughout the whole thing. Nothing was particularly bad about this film. There were actually great parts! But somehow, the sum of all its parts just equaled a movie that left me wanting. Releasing four years after Leon: The Professional, this could have been much better."
8197,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,8.0,"More enjoyable than I would've predicted.

I was expecting something more mysterious and thrilling, but <em>'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'</em> manages to entertain nicely - despite a long run time, which I thought was going to hamper it but it didn't.

The cast are excellent. I really enjoyed John Cusack's performance and Kevin Spacey plays these sorta roles well. The Lady Chablis is another strong performer, while there are roles for a younger Jude Law, Clint Eastwood - the director - regular Geoffrey Lewis and, though very tiny, an on the brink of stardom James Gandolfini.

Well worth a watch!"
8202,Æon Flux,5.0,"Not really that good of a movie, but it's action packed tho. Some of the fight scenes are pretty awesome."
8202,Æon Flux,4.0,"I didn't watch this movie before I bought it on its release day. But I'm a big Charlize Theron fan, so it was bound to be good. I'm a big sci-fi fan, so I was bound to like it. I like movies that are a little different, so it was bound to be worth watching. Oh man, when I'm wrong I'm WRONG!"
8224,8MM,5.0,"8MM probably only got greenlit due to the success of Se7en. Like Se7en, 8MM explores the existence of people who are simply pure evil while the main character wants to know why they are like this. 8MM doesn't provide many answers but it also isn't thematically complex. It follows a standard whodunit plot. While Nicolas Cage gives a solid performance, there are times where he takes us out of the story with his signature freak outs. Joel Schumacher manages to create a gritty tone but he has a rather bland style.

Regardless of its flaws, 8MM is still a decent movie. It prefers plot over exploitation and story over violence. For those reasons, I recommend it."
8224,8MM,6.0,"Another one of Nicholas Cage's crazy movies. Like all the rest of his movies, this one was good too."
8273,American Wedding,10.0,My favorite movie from the whole series. I just kept cracking up non stop throughout. Still whenever I watch it I can't stop laughing.
8274,American Pie Presents: Band Camp,7.0,I thought this would be dumb compared to the original. It's not as good still but really funny.
8274,American Pie Presents: Band Camp,1.0,"The little brother of the character Stifler from the theatrical films goes to band camp, wreaking havoc and causing mayhem, because the film makers decided you're too stupid to require laughs from your comedy. This may be one of the worst ""comedies"" I have ever seen, and I sat through ""Beer for My Horses."" I hated all the characters, the story is predictable, and the lead character is a borderline sociopath who never should have had an entire film resting on his adventures. Repulsive and sad, your level of enjoyment might depend on how funny you find the word ""stiff"" and all its incarnations.

(Unrated)- Some physical violence, strong profanity, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, very strong sexual references, strong adult situations, alcohol use."
8275,American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile,7.0,This one is my favorite one out of the presents series. A lot of nudity for the pervs. That includes you too woman lol. Also lots of drinking and drugs. I wish all college party's were this fun when I use to party.
8277,American Pie Presents: Beta House,7.0,"More college partying and trying to bang chick's for the 1st time, is back again. The presents series is turning out not to be so sad."
8293,Howards End,8.0,"The script itself is not up the level of Remains of the Day, but then E.M.Forster is not Ishiguro (Never Let Me Go). Nevertheless E.M.Forster gives us a huge, complex story that holds our interest for the entire 142 minutes.

And the Ivory-Merchant team contributes a beautiful setpiece, complete with perfect cinematography, locations, costumes and a team of the finest actors in Britain. And two of the Redgrave family to play mother and daughter. The acting from everyone on screen is phenomenal!"
8329,[REC],8.0,"**REC is zombie horror brilliance!**

REC is one of the best found-footage and zombie movies ever made. The panic, chaos, and terror that grows and spreads through a small apartment building as residents fall one by one to a zombie plague is overwhelmingly suspenseful and believable. REC starts slow but exponentially builds into a bloodcurdling frenzy with horrified characters frantically struggling to survive. This low-budget horror film belongs in the hall of fame for creativity and genius in the genre. I saw the American remake, Quarantine, many years ago, which is very similar to this film, but REC edges Quarantine with originality and a franchise of 3 other films following it. Any zombie or horror fan needs to add this to their watchlist immediately!"
8348,Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,7.0,"A hit-and-miss, if still probably good, 1974 film.

<em>'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot'</em> fails as a comedy but actually does work as a road trip/heist movie, even with a surprisingly sombre ending. To further the mixed bag feeling, I found the acting talent to be just that.

I'd say this is one of Clint Eastwood's weakest performances, though Jeff Bridges has a lot of fun and is the standout in his role. George Kennedy is closely behind him and ahead of Eastwood, in my opinion.

The film attempts a lot, I'm not convinced it all works, but I'd recommend it - the pacing is on point, so it doesn't drag."
8355,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,8.0,My favorite out of the series. Introduces a new character and he cracks me up. I love this movie.
8357,What the #$*! Do We (K)now!?,1.0,"Baloney sandwich with a side of baloney! Pretending at first to be about quantum mechanics it starts out innocently enough, seeming to look at small curiosities of ""science."" It isn't long before it takes a hard left into full-blown crap, ultimately ending in a cultish world view as a precursor to ""The Secret,"" another ""documentary"" steeped in psuedoscience. This is not a documentary about quantum mechanics but rather a gross, gross distortion of it. I really wish I had known more about this film before sitting down to watch it. Like ""The Secret,"" avoid if you value your brain cells."
8363,Superbad,8.0,"Superbad is one of the classic comedies which left a great effect on R-RATED COMEDY genre, Greg Mottola as a film-maker became a name on the industry with this break-through. I really recommend this movie and a very forceful recommendation if you are a teenage-introvert."
8363,Superbad,7.0,"Good, funny, dated.

If you can deal with a bit of cringe and some dated humour it's a good movie. I wouldn't consider it a ""top movie"" but it is _very_ funny if you just want something silly to watch casually."
8367,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,7.0,"I've always been a fan of the baddie in films - and this film really belongs to Alan Rickman's ""Sheriff"" with a good supporting effort from Geraldine McEwan as his harridan witch cohort. They bring almost all of humour and menace. The bulk of the rest of the film is a pretty run-of-the-mill vehicle for Costner, Freeman and Mastrantonio - and moves along well enough as a pretty formulaic, very freely adapted, costume drama. Brian Blessed hams marvellously in the few scenes he has and the score works well into the fabric of the movie. Sadly, the writing and direction are nothing special. Errol and Basil have little to worry about."
8386,How High,10.0,"Another one of my favorite movies. Doesn't matter if high, sober, or drunk. This movie is hilarious."
8388,¡Three Amigos!,8.0,"Just an all around fun and light-hearted comedy, one that I haven't seen in a long time (probably some time in the early 90s). Not a comedy classic but one that generates plenty of smiles and laughs. **3.75/5**"
8390,"Definitely, Maybe",7.0,"A correct comedy. No big surprises, except that Ryan Reynolds is a decent comedies' actor.

The script is the expected and it is something perfect for a rainy evening in the couch under a blanket."
8390,"Definitely, Maybe",8.0,I must say I really liked this movie. I have a little girl too so it kind of hits home for me. This movie makes you think a lot about your own life choices and past relationships that you know you will never get back. It's weird.
8392,My Neighbor Totoro,9.0,"**""Childhood"" in a movie.** 

This is just perfection - a perfect way to while away time and reconnect with your youth.  
Everything is outstanding in this film, but especially the way it can emote your sense of wonder and imagination.

I wish I could have watched this as a child, I would have wanted to find Totoro and the Catbus, roar like Totoro, or sleep on his belly.  Oh well...I will just have to imagine it.

Its interesting to note this was released with Grave of the Fireflies, another Ghibli masterpiece, which I have summed up as being about innocence lost.  **This movie is innocence maintained.**"
8392,My Neighbor Totoro,8.0,"Aggressively cute.

<em>'My Neighbor Totoro'</em> holds an extremely hearty story, one told via impeccably beautiful animation. Noriko Hidaka and Chika Sakamoto standout as Satsuki and Mei, the relationship between those two characters is so sweet. They do get a bit shouty in parts which ever so slightly irritates, but that's definitely one to file under 'nit-picking'.

A simple movie, one which displays the imagination of children perfectly. Big fan of the Catbus. 🐱"
8413,Event Horizon,8.0,"A fantastic ""horror in space"" thriller led by an excellent assemble cast (Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neil, Kathy Quinlann). Do we really want to know what can be found at the edge (event horizon) of a black hole?"
8413,Event Horizon,8.0,"A fantastic ""horror in space"" thriller led by an excellent assemble cast (Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neil, Kathy Quinlann). Do we really want to know what can be found at the edge (event horizon) of a black hole?"
8413,Event Horizon,6.0,"This is the third time seeing this one and my opinion pretty much remained the same. Some interesting ideas but not very well executed, though that's kind of Paul W.S. Anderson's style of filmmaking it would seem. Visual effects are at times iffy (the CGI in particuular) but the acting was okay and I can't say I ever was bored or mystified with what I was watching. **3.25/5**"
8427,I Spy,6.0,"Hadn't seen this since it was released on DVD and... pretty much remember it being as mediocre as it was back then. Normally with these buddy films, you have one character who is off-kilter while the other is more serious, but here you had both off-kilter. Had this been today, would've been a good opportunity to be a spoof of Mission: Impossible; cast a normally serious actor to play opposite the outlandish character. **3.0/5**"
8452,The 6th Day,6.0,"_The 6th Day_ is a **great** title for a movie about man-made lifeforms. The movie never really lives up to that, I 100% understand the criticisms it received when it was released, but I actually did enjoy watching it. 

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
8461,Funny Games,1.0,"This is a movie I can't help but really despise. Especially egregious is the pretentious way in which the filmmaker takes a position of haughty moral indignation and attempts to guilt-trip his own audience for wanting to watch a horror film in the first place. We know what he wanted to achieve with this movie, because he has told us explicitly; and he thought so highly of his achievement that he decided to make the film twice, shot-for-shot. Every scene is deliberately calculated to be as awkward to watch and as boring as possible, since anti-suspense is part of the ""point"". It is essentially the writer/director giving a middle finger to anyone willing to sit through this finger-wagging tripe."
8467,Dumb and Dumber,8.0,"Very funny. Not just silly. I often cite this film as my favourite all time film. It took me time to watch it for the first time as it looked like a number of other films which are silly and claim to be hilarious but usually miss the point. This film nails it. The comedy is constant and is cleverly done with situations fitting nicely into the storyline which acts as the perfect vehicle for the perfect delivery of an amazing script. The Carrelly brothers other films are good too but usually have something uncomfortable in. Dumb and Dumber is their masterpiece. I can imagine them finishing it, then going over the script asking, ""what else can we add to this joke to make it funnier?"" A very difficult film to beat in comedy. I'm going to watch it again now."
8467,Dumb and Dumber,6.0,"These guys are the very meaning of dumb. They don't get any dumber then this. Even though there pretty dumb they still were smarter then the bad guys, just because their dumb!"
8467,Dumb and Dumber,,This is so bad despite it being really good yet I still think it’s good despite me thinking it’s really bad.
8467,Dumb and Dumber,,They outdumb every goddamn person in any goddamn film ever - except maybe horror films.
8469,Animal House,,"Filipe Manuel Neto is a retard who says that this timeless classic is ''Dated and not very appealing to the current public''. It's actually a brilliant film and the only people it wouldn't appeal to is left wing Guardian newspaper reading labour voters, but no one cares about any of them anyway.  Oh and the film isn't ''early 50 years old'', it's 45 years old. Big difference you old cunt."
8471,Far North,6.0,"Interesting and psychological dark movie in spite of the glacial surrounding.

The isolation feeling is well executed and the cast works quite well.

However, you cannot help feeling that something is missing and could have been done better at the end of the story."
8487,Wild Wild West,6.0,"THE GOOD:
1) It's funny
2) Got good action
3) The music video is awesome
4) It stars Will Smith and Kevin Kline

THE BAD:
1) It didn't live up to the original series
2) Over the top storyline
3) I hate spiders!

THE UGLY:
1) This rating right here!"
8488,Hitch,7.0,"**Hitch finds clever ways to make us laugh at all of our horrible memories of dates gone wrong while telling an endearing story full of heart and hilarity.**

Hitch makes complete use of Will Smith’s charm and Kevin Smith’s goofiness in a story reminding us that true love can only be found when we are truly ourselves. As Will Smith’s love doctor tries to win Eva Mendes’ heart, all of his sophisticated attempts at romance end up at hilariously embarrassing failures that make for some side-splitting laughs. The story is simple but sincere as Hitch learns that finding love isn’t about changing his clients into someone lovable instead, it’s about helping people see how lovable his clients already are. Hitch is earnest, charming, fun, and a must-see for anyone that loves a good rom-com."
8488,Hitch,10.0,One of my favorite movies of all time again. Love this movie! I love movies that have a storyline that's not common in a lot of movies. Thus is also really hilarious.
8491,Weekend at Bernie's,8.0,"My go-to when I just want to sit back and relax, especially with the hot weather where I am (plus no A/C). Still a whole lot of fun and the dynamic between Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy was entertaining (and for playing a dead guy, kudos to Terry Kiser, RIP). Shame this is a Fox (Disney) title as this one deserves a special edition from Shout Factory... **3.75/5**"
8536,Superman II,8.0,"**He was called Non because that is the amount of brains he had.**


Great sequel that expands on the introductory scenes in Superman (1978) where we met General Zod, Ursa and the massive moron, Non - although I wouldn't call him a moron to his face. (Perhaps if I had a ladder)

But anyway, these three criminals are inadvertently released from the Phantom Zone by Superman and they naturally head toward Earth seeking revenge on the son of their jailer.

Hackman receives top billing this time now that Brando collected his pay cheque and was at the bank cashing it.
A very entertaining and funny sequel thanks to Richard Lester's expert hand at comedy.



- Potential Kermode"
8536,Superman II,8.0,"<em>'Superman II'</em> is a more rounded affair, though is no more entertaining than the first film - I enjoyed both the same, more or less. Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder remain as watchable as before, but Gene Hackman isn't as memorable in this follow-up - still good, mind.

I like how we got to see extra of Zod, Ursa and Non in this one, if only to see more of Terence Stamp - who I've only really seen later in his career, he's terrific in 2011's <em>'The Adjustment Bureau'</em>. Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran as the other two characters are decent.

A perfectly solid sequel, you can't ask for much more than that."
8545,Little Voice,7.0,"Jane Horrocks is a revelation in this touching story about a timid girl whose mother (Brenda Blethyn) is dating a sleazy talent agent (Michael Caine). Horrocks has an imaginary friend for whom she has a habit of singing, is overheard by Caine and he determines to put her on the stage. Blethyn is great is the venal mother, and Caine equally unscrupulous as they both try to exploit their shy charge. Her only salvation in all this is her friend ""Billy"" (Ewan McGregor) a local pigeon fancier who proves to be her true friend as she struggles with all the pressure. Horrock's own performance is superb - not only is she actually a great mimic (Judy Garland being a choice example of her talents) but she is also one hell of a chanteuse too. Pepperered with humour and pathos, this is a great little film."
8555,Creep,8.0,"Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

This is a great survival horror story that really rachets up the tension as the situation progresses.

The idea of being hunted in the subway with homeless and rats around is very intriguing for me.  Sadly, like most good horror movies, I can't talk about most of it without spoilers.

I will say this has some great concepts in it and the over all story structure is very well done with some good twists / surprises in it.

It may not be a feel-good love story, but it would be a pretty bad survival horror story if it was."
8555,Creep,4.0,"Ok, I confess that the background story and the movie cover attracted my attention. And when I saw Christopher Smith name here I expected something (Severance, Triangle, I thought I had something good to expect)

 I will be brief and make a full spoiler here: the premise is good, the execution not so much.

It is very inconsistent, like a person will be ""forgotten"" in a subway station? People don't clean the trains into the night hours? A psycho child from the anti-Blitz tunnels of WWII? No one misses the presence of people (especially workers) in the subway?

Come on, that's too much.

Plus Franka Potente (Run Lola, Run) is really bad here. At least the dog is ok. :)

My score: 4.0 (barely) out of 10.0 / C -"
8588,Shooting Dogs,8.0,Great drama and great characters for the untold story of Hutus and Tutsis conflict in Rwanda and the naïveness of the good hearted people against the cruel reality and the tough decisions to make.
8617,Prom Night,7.0,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

Brittany Snow is great in this, she really does a top notch embodying the terror of her character while still being a strong female lead.  There are also other actors in this.

Honestly, Idris Elba and Johnathon Schaech carry a fair portion of the movie.

It does do something fun when it follows the villain as if he is one of the protagonists.  It helps that some of the teens are awful, you can almost root for him as he progresses.

It is hard to talk about without spoilers, but I can safely say that they manage to both follow him and kept the audience guessing about what the villain is going to do next."
8617,Prom Night,6.0,Girl who was attacked and survived the attack. Has always thought she would be attacked again. At her prom death starts to happen. Pretty decent movie.
8649,Bringing Out the Dead,4.0,"Been a long time since I last watched this and according to IMDb I gave it a 3/10. With the new Paramount release on 4K, I decided to give it another watch and while I can appreciate some of the style and even performances, this one just didn't do much for me and is one of Scorsese's lesser movies. Probably won't ever revisit this one. **2.25/5**"
8656,Deep Impact,6.0,"I was really disappointed, considering all of the great actors involved and since I love science fiction and the great disaster films of days gone by. I bought the DVD used and got my money's worth--it's a decent watch.

I would recommend watching if you like disaster movies or any of the actors involved, maybe even renting or buying the DVD used or for a really good price new, say for 5 bucks, but anything more would be wasteful or being ripped off."
8681,Taken,9.5,"One of my best films of all time. Apart from they made a second one, this a great movie! Liam Neeson trying to save this daughter, in France, from being sold to the highest bidder. An action packed film with good acting and great fight scenes."
8681,Taken,,"Daddy knows best — especially when it comes to a mostly untrustworthy cast of Europeans — in this action film. Liam Neeson's performance elevated this from being forgettable. Otherwise, I kind of didn't care."
8681,Taken,6.0,"Probably not good enough to have started the Revenge-Renaissance that it somehow did, but still a pretty entertaining time. _Taken_ does hit a lot of clichés though, and I mean, it starts hitting them right away. We're literally only minutes into the film before we find out that Neeson's lead character is divorced, and his wife has re-married to a decent, rich provider, but one who's bookish and could never take him in a fight, and that the present he got for his daughter is for an interest that she no longer has. But once we get into the action proper, it's pretty great.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
8681,Taken,8.0,"Random viewing tonight, just wanted a slick and simple action-thriller and this fit the bill. Liam Neeson kicks ass and can see why his career in this genre really took off. The camera work was probably the biggest drawback (shaky cam), likely trying emulate the Bourne franchise or something. But entertaining flick that doesn't overstay its welcome coming in at around 90-minutes. **4.0/5**"
8681,Taken,10.0,"**You will find this movie. You will watch it.**

This movie came out of nowhere! The trailer for this film relied on just one short scene of Liam Neeson threatening a kidnapper on the phone... and that was all we needed to be hooked! A basic revenge/rescue movie elevated by fantastic action, stunt directing, and Liam Neeson's delivery, all transporting this thriller into a believable reality. One of the best of the genre that paved the way for John Wick."
8688,Snake Eyes,5.0,"It’s just typical John Travolta , Nicholas Cage , doing John Travolta and Nick Cage Until the demise of one of them.

Not memorable. But you knew that!"
8696,Calendar Girls,9.0,"Another one of those movies I watched decades ago and recently revisited. I enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time.

It reminds me of Waking Ned Devine in a way. It contains witty and realistic dialogue and a good percentage of the actors are older. There is a bit more drama in Calendar Girls, but it never submerges into melodrama.

I am glad I watched it a second time. It has aged well and is a classic feel old movie."
8696,Calendar Girls,9.0,"Another one of those movies I watched back when it came out and recently watched again. Like the women who pose for the calendar, the movie has aged well. My wife and I watch a lot of British tv (for Americans) so we have seen the actresses in many other excellent performances.

Calendar a Girls reminds me of another great movie, (Waking) Ned Devine. There is humor, a feel good plot, and a fine ensemble cast. There are a perhaps a couple of more serious subplots in this film, such as Alderton’s character’s illness that gives birth to the calendar fundraiser.

The movie is of course based on an actual fundraising calendar undertaken from women aged 45-65. I didn’t research it to see how accurate the plot is as I do in some reality based films, because I just watched it for is entertainment value.  So should you."
8697,Who Am I?,8.0,"The car chase scenes were awesome! The fight scenes are outstanding! This is probably my favorite Jackie Chan movie. I particularly like the chase scene in the city with the Lancer Evo IV. The whole desert scenario with the rally Montero is hilarious, too! It is capped off with one of Jackie Chan's best fight scenes ever in the end. A must see!"
8698,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,10.0,This movie was amazing! Went to see it at the cinema when it first got released back in 2003. For the time the special effects in this movie are mind blowing. A must watch in my opinion.
8698,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,8.0,"Enjoyed it.

<em>'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'</em> does nothing all that extraordinary but produces a fun time nevertheless. Great cast, fast paced plot and entertaining action. The ending slightly underwhelms, but I still found myself satisfied with it. The special effects are good, it's only ""The Nautilus"" that looks less than so.

Sean Connery does carry the film as Quatermain, he's terrific throughout - really enjoyed the way his character carries himself. I liked Tony Curran's Skinner too. I actually rate all the characters to be honest, with Jason Flemyng (Jekyll/Hyde) and Stuart Townsend (Gray) being my picks of the rest.

Merits a watch, even if Connery didn't remember it all that fondly."
8738,The Final Countdown,8.0,"Pretty fun Twilight Zone-esque movie that was entertaining throughout. Always like the ideas of alternate history and while this doesn't quite change history in the end (and shouldn't given it was Pearl Harbor, not to mention when this movie was released, survivors were only in their early/mid 60s), still was a good time. On the downside, the actual travel through the portal was cheesy and cheap even for 1979/80. **3.75/5**

As a side, interesting that only 7 years later, the sons of Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen will star in Wall Street..."
8741,The Thin Red Line,4.0,"As war movies go, this one sucks. I'm pretty sure (although I didn't read it, that the novel (and maybe original screenplay) must have been fantastic, but Terrence Malick really bungled this: no clear vision, no character investment, a ridiculous amount of stupid jump cuts. I was willing to quit 40% into the film but my wife wanted to see the rest (as almost kind of a challenge to see if she could spot another of the many famous that wanted to work with him (and probably regretted it later)."
8769,Christine,8.0,"""It's going to suck, let's watch something else.... It's going to suck, let's watch something else.... King Adaptations always suck, let's watch something else.""

""You realize it's John Carpenter right?""

""Oh, let's rent Christine.""

That is honestly how the conversation went when I was in High School.... and I am glad I gave it a chance. It's actually one of the better adaptations of a King novel, and, really, this was CLASSIC King.

Carpenter did a great job of cutting away the fat and making a screen adaptation of a King novel that still held true to the spirit of the novel.

I was surprised, but, then, Carpenter is really great at that sort of thing."
8771,Mind Ripper,10.0,"It's not a great film, but nearly all of the Caverns Underground Monster flicks aren't great films. To the letter they are all low budget B-movie throw aways.

And this is no exception... save for the fact it has Wes Craven's name attached to it so people come in expecting something more... expecting a movie he directed and not one he simply produced.

But the monster is underplayed and entertaining. The tension is claustrophobic and done well, and ultimately it's an enjoyable flick.

Grant you, it's one of those late night insomnia flicks that you watch once and throw away, but it's entertaining enough for what it is, and what it is is a B-Movie that knows it's a B-Movie, that tried it's absolute best to make something fun inside the constraints of a B-Movie with all"
8780,Baby Mama,10.0,Freaking hilarious movie. These 2 together crack me up. Just like they did on SNL.
8810,Mad Max 2,8.0,"Really great sequel that surpasses the original. While short on character moments, the action sequences were fantastic culminating with an adrenaline-filled finale. All in all highly entertaining with just enough weidness to make it stand out all the more... **4.0/5**"
8814,Doom,4.0,"Now you could watch this, I guess, I wouldn't stop you. But for a movie only a decade and change old, _Doom_ has dated **hard**, and it's not just 'cause of that garbage CGI.

Weird like the videogame it's based on, but still fucks up the lore that I can't see it sitting well with that crowd either. _Doom_ might genuinely have been made for no one.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
8834,Conspiracy Theory,6.0,Overly long but amiable suspense-thriller thanks to the charms of Mel Gibson (re-teaming with Lethal Weapon franchise director Richard Donner) and Julia Roberts with Patrick Stewart making for an okay villain. This is one I've seen a couple times and each viewing has pretty much been the same: entertaining but also unremarkable. **3.0/5**
8834,Conspiracy Theory,10.0,"Well... this was fun.

I don't think you can say anything better about a movie. Conspiracy Theory was fun. You sit down and watch it, and you are going to have a fun time, you are going to be entertained.

It's a great blend of moderate action and comedic suspense. The plot twists are deep enough to be interesting and light enough to be entertaining in the darker aspects of comedy.

The characters, well, the characters are the very definition of the phrase, ""he's a real character isn't he?""

Mel Gibson is fun to watch in this, he plays a character that is tormented, broken, and still endlessly amusing.

You really can't get better than a movie that is fun to watch."
8835,Legally Blonde,7.0,"An entertaining movie that with the title alone alerts you that it is brazenly silly, though Reese Witherspoon's character Elle Woods has challenges that make you cheer for her. Awkward social situations are well handled by the character and credit to the writers and director for resolving these with good morals. All of the major cast roles are well done."
8835,Legally Blonde,7.0,"Surprisingly funny and good. I was expecting this to be a dumb movie honestly. They did a good job. Yeah she was a blonde and acted like blonde, but she was legally smart at being an attorney."
8835,Legally Blonde,7.0,"<em>'Legally Blonde'</em> is good. There is plenty of cheese and you can see where the story is heading from basically the get-go, though it is all brought to life by an impressive Reese Witherspoon performance. There are amusing moments, plus it has a pleasantly short run time. Overall, I did find it enjoyable."
8843,The Cell,6.0,"I can't... I can't call _The Cell_ good... But it's artistically spectacular, features one of D'Onofrio's best roles ever, and though it has unoriginal concepts, it uses them in originally thematic ways. I can't call _The Cell_ good... But I can tell you to watch it.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
8843,The Cell,10.0,"The Cell is a forgotten classic. Way ahead of its time, it is a cinematic delight. It could be best described as a psychological thriller but it is so much more. Don't hesitate to enjoy this gem. It is visually stunning with a gripping story. JLo is good in this despite her booty never being the focus. Yes, it makes an appearance in a side view but it doesn't overwhelm. For serious, this is a 10-star film. Have fun!"
8844,Jumanji,7.0,The original movie. Robin Williams makes this movie funny. Honestly without him the movie would be nothing.
8845,Under Siege,7.0,"The fun kind of dumb, _Under Siege_ is probably Segal's best work, and in my opinion the only reason people ever mention him in the same breath as the likes of Stallone, Schwarzenegger or Willis.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time_."
8849,Alfie,5.0,"Some films just don't need an ""update"". ""Alfie"" certainly didn't. Certainly Jude Law has a certain je ne sais quoi reprising the Michael Caine role as the womanising philanderer. His normal hump 'em and dump' em strategy is soon seriously compromised by his inability to ""perform"" and this has all sorts of ramifications on his shallow existence (relocated to New York in this version). Sienna Miller and Susan Sarandon fail to help lift this great looking but intellectually void film get going, and Law - though every inch the dapper, gorgeous, gigolo to look at - just hasn't the charm or sleaziness of Caine. It does have a decent soundtrack, but not the same with out Cilla Black..."
8850,The Shadow,8.0,"A tongue-in-cheek nostalgic throwback to the thirties and forties. Love the style, the imagery and the period. Heaps of fun!"
8851,The Blob,8.0,"The campy theme over the strange title sequence may make you think it will be a very campy horror film that doesn't take itself seriously, you would be half right, but you'd also be half wrong. It is campy, but it takes its self seriously most of the time.

Everytime I watch it it gets a few laughs and giggles out of me, I've been watching it since I was five and I recently watched it for the 7th time.

I would give it a 7.4/10."
8854,Steel,2.0,"_Steel_ is **so** far removed from the source material that I honestly feel like they could have made exactly the same movie, called it something else, and nobody would ever assume that it has anything to do with the DC Comics character.

Oh also it sucks.

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._"
8854,Steel,8.0,"This movie sits firmly in the ""It's so bad that it's good"" category. If you watch this review, you will see exactly why this is the case...
https://odysee.com/@SpaceIce:8/shaq's-movie-'steel'-proved-sledgehammer:8"
8866,The Truth About Cats & Dogs,6.0,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

This movie has held up over a long period of time due to stellar performances by Janeane Garofalo and Uma Thurman, and that's really all it has going for it.  Great actors giving solid delivery in a decent script.

It does remind me of Cyrano de Bergerac a bit, but it's a classic switcheroo trope for a romantic comedy that gives a life lesson of beauty is what you make of it.

My biggest problem is that they basically call Garofalo ugly because she's not Thurman, which doesn't make sense to me.

Other that that, the script is strong enough without being spectacular, and I feel like the cast had to work very hard to make the movie what it is.

A modern day reboot is surely on the way with it being about a podcast of the same name."
8867,The Punisher,2.0,Almost works more as a goofball comedy mocking all those action films of the 1980's. Almost. Gossett comes off so much better than the material handed to him.
8870,Red Planet,4.0,"_Red Planet_ has so much going on, and it doesn't have control of any of it. Not a single actor fits their character, except possibly Carrie-Ann Moss, who spends basically the entire runtime too benched to really count as a character in 99% of the story anyway.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
8871,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,7.0,"I'm not gonna lie, this version of the Grinch scared the crap out of me when I was a kid!

But as I got older I started to get use to it.
The trick was to just listen to the whole thing without looking at it and gradually (each year take a peak)."
8871,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,7.0,At first I didn't like this movie. It's one of my daughters favorites tho. So she would always want to watch a lot around Christmas time. Now I don't mind it and it's like a Christmas tradition for us now to watch this movie.
8871,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,7.0,This is my favorite version and has been my favorite since I was a small child.
8872,Wayne's World,7.0,I wish I could dress the exact same every day and still be cool.
8874,My Best Friend's Wedding,8.0,I don't know why I like this movie. I think it's just because of how crazy funny Julia Roberts starts acting when she finds out her best friend is getting married. Kind of reminds me of some of my crazy ex's.
8879,Pale Rider,8.0,"This is a good'un.

<em>'Pale Rider'</em> features an enjoyable story featuring the gold rush, while the characters are all solid - Clint Eastwood gives a strong performance in the lead role, though I would've liked to have seen more of John Russell and his character.

I don't think it's perfect or anything, but I got entertainment from it and that's enough for me - I've not got much more to note."
8883,Flame & Citron,8.0,"Very interesting story!

<em>'Flame & Citron'</em> is a film certainly worthy of your time. It does probably overrun a little with a 130 minute run time and could pick up the pace here and there, though overall this historical drama from 2008 makes for intruiging viewing. It's very well made.

I had no knowledge of the real life of those portrayed, so it's good to learn of their World War II involvement; albeit with the usual stretched truth/fictionalization/whatever that films tend to do. The titular characters are played by Thure Lindhardt and Mads Mikkelsen, both give super performances as the former particularly impresses."
8913,Pet Sematary,6.0,"Even if it wasn't any good, Pet Sematary's sort of a must watch given how heavily it's been referenced in the film and television industries since. But it is good, so there's that too.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
8914,Deep Blue Sea,5.0,"There's quite a cast assembled for _Deep Blue Sea_, not what we've come to expect from the Asuylum-soiled genre of shark movies in this day and age. It's not a fantastic movie, but it proves more watchable that 90% of its company.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole_."
8914,Deep Blue Sea,6.0,"An engaging thriller with a mindless plot, Deep Blue Sea managed to keep me hooked throughout its loud 100-minute running time. A doctor and her team of researchers looking to find a cure for Alzheimer's in sharks in an isolated facility in the middle of an ocean - what more do you need for some sweet chaos while also supported by some unethical practices? Deep Blue Sea is not the most realistic shark film out there but it has a lot of cool action, suspense, the added pleasure of flooding sequences, and a protagonist that you love to hate. Go for it. (Grade B-). TN."
8914,Deep Blue Sea,7.0,"**Peak corny shark goodness!** 🦈🦈🦈

Deep Blue Sea falls prey to every shark movie trope and has a blast doing it. Embracing its cheesiness makes this movie one is the all-time best shark flicks—a fabulous cocktail of 90s cheese, sharks, and surprising twists. If you haven’t seen this one, I guarantee you will be surprised by who survives and who doesn’t."
8916,Antz,5.0,Didn't know what to expect from this movie. It was surprisingly good. Very funny with a decent storyline.
8916,Antz,4.0,It's an animated movie with voices from lots of big-name stars and it's quite fun. But I'm still embarrassed I own it.
8920,Garfield,8.0,Like this movie. I always enjoy the real versions of animated movies. This was done well. Garfield being pissed off at Odie for John bringing him home.
8922,Jeepers Creepers,,I loved this movie.For it's budget & little CGI used.It was a great thriller.I don't consider it as horror.I'm sure many don't agree.I have been hoping for a new movie.
8922,Jeepers Creepers,7.0,"An under-appreciated horror piece from my formative years, best watched going in with no clue what you are in for.

_Final rating: ★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._"
8922,Jeepers Creepers,6.0,"Just OK. Justin Long is his usual quirky, excellent self. Gina Philips plays the sometimes right, sometimes wrong older sister. Won't be watching the other ones..."
8923,Green Street Hooligans,9.0,"Woefully underrated drama too often passed off as a ""boy's night"" action film.

_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._"
8960,Hancock,1.0,"Yeah, this stank.

Hancock had character at the start of the film, but that slowly faded away by the second half, that just sort of floundered until it ended.

It lacked the humor that comes with a lot of Will Smith's other outings, and it lacks the charisma that usually seeps out of Smith.

It just seemed to fail on every front."
8960,Hancock,8.0,I like this movie because it's different from your typical superhero character. He cracks me up to. They have some pretty cool fight scenes in this.
8961,Bad Boys II,8.0,"Really funny, and action packed. One of my favorite movies of all time."
8967,The Tree of Life,5.0,"A movie that wants to mean more than what is actually telling.

Taking a lot of things borrowed from 2001, it doesn't even come close to have such a deep an interesting meaning."
8968,Boogeyman,8.0,Everyone is afraid of the boogeyman. I really like this movie. I love a good horror flick.
8970,The Out-of-Towners,6.0,"_**Fun with Steve Martin & Goldie Hawn in Massachusetts and New York City**_

An empty nest couple from Ohio (Steve Martin & Goldie Hawn) travels to the Big Apple and has many misadventures as they reevaluate their relationship and lives. John Cleese plays a hotel manager.

""The Out-of-Towners"" (1999) is a remake of the 1970 comedy, which I’ve never seen. Critics are too hard on it since it gives ya what ya pay for: A fun hour and a half with a spirited cast and quality locations.  

The film was shot in Massachusetts (Arlington & the turnpike) and New York City with some stuff done in Los Angeles & Santa Ana (the airport).

GRADE: B-"
8974,The War of the Worlds,6.0,"Not great in terms of the script, acting or the abrupt ending, the practical effects were impressive and a lot of fun with the Martian ships flying and causing mayhem and destruction. I can imagine this wowed audiences back in '53. **3.0/5**"
8983,Felidae,,The film was released in youtube premiere on August 2013. Movie is not for children. For older teens and up.
8997,Hollow Man II,3.0,"_Hollow Man II_ takes it a different way, which is fine, different's not just good, in this case, I think it's necessary. But the biggest difference between _Hollow Man_ #1 and #2, is that #2 is boring. I don't ask that it have the same intrigue as the first, just that it have any. Anything to take it beyond ""There is a man and he's invisible and he's bad and the protagonist is not"".

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
8999,Derailed,6.0,Could've been better but still an effective enough suspense-thriller. I remember seeing this in theaters back in 2005 and probably the bigger surprise was seeing Jennifer Aniston playing against type. This was also a time period where it seemed Clive Owen was everywhere. **3.25/5**
9007,Just Like Heaven,8.0,"It's a little heavy-footed and almost tries too hard, yet I quite enjoyed <em>'Just Like Heaven'</em>.

Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo are a strong pairing, with Jon Heder spearheading a good support cast ably. It's a well paced film at around 90 minutes, there are some decently amusing scenes in there alongside some more sombre ones - the majority of which come off rather well. Some parts are cliché, but not to the degree that it affected my enjoyment.

One that is well worth a watch, in my opinion of course."
9013,Midnight Run,10.0,"""Midnight Run"" has a generous measure of wonderfully executed action sequences and comedy that is genuinely funny, although there is an extremely high reliance upon swearing and this will undoubtedly offend and alienate the more sensitive souls sitting out there in the audience. This is also a hugely entertaining film which contains a number of memorable Robert De Niro moments - he is fascinating to watch during the scene where he visits his ex-wife Gail to borrow some money (this, in turn, leads to a spectacularly awkward encounter with his daughter which eventually ends in embarrassing silence) and again when he finally comes face to face with Jimmy Serrano, an unwelcome face from his past - and the many locations look absolutely gorgeous."
9016,Treasure Planet,7.0,"Loosely based on one of my favourite stories, this version of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" sees the young Jim Hawkins on a magical adventure on a space galleon. Befriended by the cyborg cook ""Silver"" they face all sorts of perils on their journey before arriving at the ""Treasure Planet"" whereupon the young lad realises that his pal isn't quite so trustworthy. It's a great adventure story, the voice talents are fun making their mischievous characters engaging to watch - and the animation, though maybe not quite as vivid and detailed as I would have liked, still keeps the narrative alive and thriving. Still not a patch on the superb Robert Newton version (1950) but still a very entertaining watch."
9017,Outpost,6.0,"This film should have been more than it was. The premise is great, the atmosphere is spot-on, the costumes and make-up are menacing and the characters are pretty decent. This menace is somehow lost, however, at some point during the overblown final plot-arc, which is a major shame because it really looks stunning and builds up some satisfying apprehension.
I cannot give it less than three stars, but only because I absolutely love this sort of thing, having grown up with Wolfenstein and Doom to take me to the early hours. One day somebody will nail this idea and unleash true grim krieg."
9021,The Santa Clause 2,7.0,"I think it's good.

To me, <em>'The Santa Clause 2'</em> runs the original film very close. I found the plot to this one more consistently enjoyable, whereas the first one starts off stronger than it finishes - I'd still class the 1994 production better, but this is a solid sequel in my opinion.

Tim Allen reprises his role as Scott and continues to be showpiece of the film. Elizabeth Mitchell is decent as Carol, while Spencer Breslin - who is good in <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em>, and yes I like that film - fits his character well. My point being, this has a slightly improved support cast.

Going back to the premise itself, it's nothing to take seriously of course but I felt suitably entertained by it. Intrigued to see where the second sequel goes."
9032,Big Daddy,6.0,"Good watch, could watch agian, and can recommeond.

While it's a typical Happy Madiosn / Adam Sandler, the importance of the child's welfare kind of balances it out as far as ""seriousness"" goes.

The humor stands up, even if some of it is problematic, but even then that was the point, to push boundaries.

It's a funny, charming movie that reminds of a time when I didn't like Leslie Mann, mostly because she got written into to some jerk roles, more than just being a straight man, like ""vengeful woman"" jerk, and even with her being ""in the right"" about it, she still comes off a a villain, in place of an antagonist other than ""life"".

The movie is exactly what the premise is: by horrible circumstance some kid gets stuck with Adam Sandler, comedy ensues.  Nothing really special, but it's not bad even after 20 years."
9032,Big Daddy,10.0,One of my favorite Adam Sandler movies. This movie is hilarious. My daughter loved this movie as a kid as well. Now that she is a teen she loves Adam Sandler but always calls him big daddy. She says that's the only way she could remember him.
9035,Slither,8.0,"A comedy-horror riff on an alien-parasite invasion of a small rural town is fun, gross and completely engaging. James Gunn demonstrates his pre-GOG chops, getting the most of the great acting ensemble including Elizabeth Banks, Michael Rooker, and Nathan Fillon."
9036,Eight Below,7.0,"Not as dark or heart-wrenching as it could've, and perhaps should've, been. With that noted, <em>'Eight Below'</em> - a remake of 1983's <em>'Antarctica'</em> - is still a fairly decent survival drama.

The cast certainly elevate my feelings towards the film, with Paul Walker impressing in the lead role; it comes across as if he actually does have a bond with the dogs, which is obviously key.

It's very much Walker's show, but Bruce Greenwood, Jason Biggs and Moon Bloodgood all add small but welcomed things with their characters. The dogs themselves are great and do a lot of good work onscreen, a load of which being pretty believable.

There are saddening parts to it, for sure, but overall I wanted a more deeper ride with this premise than what I got, but there's definitely reasons to watch it."
9037,Grease 2,4.0,Not any where close as good as the first. Just not the same vibe. The songs are horrible. Also the storyline is horrible.
9043,The Family Stone,,"Fun, Entertaining, and VERY Predictable. This christmas based romantic comedy made me miss my own dysfunctional family. The Family Stone can be enjoyed by all. Luke Wilson was hilarious. Claire Danes looked great and Diane Keaton made this family. You'll laugh, You'll Cry, and you might want to call your Mom after watching this."
9051,10,6.0,"Another stupid comedy about the mid-life crisis of a man and his obsession with a beautiful woman, until he realizes that the obsession is senseless. Quite similar to other movies la ""The Woman in Red""."
9051,10,7.0,"First half is pretty slow, but it gets much funnier once Dudley Moore begins his famous drunk routine."
9051,10,7.0,"First half is pretty slow, but it gets much funnier once Dudley Moore begins his famous drunk routine."
9057,Terminal Velocity,5.0,"Man of the moment Charlie Sheen is ""Ditch"", an accident-prone, pain in the neck skydiver. When one of his passengers (Nastassja Kinski), ostensibly on her first jump, hits the ground with one hell of a thud, he is certain that he took all the steps necessary to ensure her safety. What happened? Well nothing is quite as it seems, and soon he is on the trail of some dodgy KGB agents after some airborne gold. There is plenty of action, to be fair, but the film is simply a vehicle for Sheen, and he has long since lost his boyish charms. The dialogue seems to have emerged from a teenage scriptwriters meeting that decided ""let's use some smutty words, tee tee"", and the plot is really pretty thin and lacklustre. Some films just don't have much of a shelf life - this is certainly one of those."
9058,Only You,6.0,Your typical love story. Girl was told the name of the man she will marry one day by a fortune teller. She believed it and meets a guy who lies and says that is his name.
9059,Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight,6.0,"Yeeeeeeaaaaaaah booooyyyyyyy.

I have very fond memories of _Demon Knight_ from the days of the active horror community on Tumblr. I don't know if this is ""good"", but must a movie be ""good""? Can we not simply have BIlly Zane wearing sunglasses in the dark, commanding his squad of practical effect demon puppets, and call it a day?

Sidenote: I know this is a _Tales from the Crypt_ movie, but I would happily have given up the Cryptkeeper bookends for 5 more minutes of the actually story, silly as it is.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9062,Love Story,7.0,"Well acted tear-jerker has some nice scenes and dialogue between Ryan O'Neil and Ali MacGraw, and thankfully not overly schmaltzy. Today this sort of thing would be on Lifetime but back in 70 was a box office hit. Not sure it's something I'll watch again anytime soon but decent for a romance-drama. **3.5/5**"
9064,Hellbound: Hellraiser II,7.0,"Pretty out there (in a good way) sequel that doesn't make a whole lot of sense but still was an entertaining supernatural horror flick, the kind of horror I'm generally not a fan of. Kind of surprising Ashley Laurence didn't go on to bigger things (her last movie was 2008). **3.5/5**"
9064,Hellbound: Hellraiser II,5.0,"""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is watchable enough even though it very quickly slides down the steep slope into becoming a messy shambles. It is really nothing more than a tour through the diseased imagination of Clive Barker - it is hard to believe somebody out there actually thought this was a good basis for a film instead of seeking out some description of psychiatric treatment for the poor soul - and its major handicap is that the special effects just aren't up to the challenge of supporting his thoroughly twisted and uniquely original vision. There  is also a desperately heavy reliance on copious amounts of blood and gore just for the hell of it and when you add in the fact that sadly a good portion of it is also totally forgettable what you're left with is nothing more than a modest gore fest of desperately limited impact."
9065,Europa,8.0,"Goodtropa.  One thing you can say about this film is you have never seen anything like it before. Most chilling is the soundtrack, although von Trier does over-direct once in a while. I did appreciate this more than his ""Breaking the Waves."""
9077,Tarantula,6.0,"Allowing for the fact that the special effects are getting on for 65 years old, this is a cracking little sci-fi/horror feature. John Agar is the scientist on the trail of an industrial-sized spider that is wreaking havoc on a local Arizona community. Leo G. Carroll (in increasingly ""Elephant Man"" style make up) and Mara Corday help keep this Jack Arnold film moving along well. Herman Stein's music is a little derivative but it also helps to create some tension as they all race to stop the arachnid terror from desiccating everything it meets."
9089,Home for the Holidays,4.0,"The dialogue is a bit unnatural and the characters are over the top, but it's okay. Worth watching if you're in the mood for a light-hearted 90s family comedy/drama. It has its moments."
9102,Screamers,6.0,"Unfortunately, not quite the movie I remember it being when I was a kid. Not bad, even worth watching, especially for Peter Weller, but I think I had made a better version of it in my head in the twenty years since the last time I watched it, so this re-visit was a little disappointing.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9266,Blue Crush,5.0,It's a decent movie but I'm not really into surfing. The girls aren't even attractive either. I only watched this cause it was a free movie.
9267,And Now for Something Completely Different,5.0,"I probably expected too much from this.
The theater advertised a showing of Holy Grail, so I went in with the usual expectations of rolling in the aisles with laughter, but this showed instead.
It was fairly funny, but I don't think they did their best material for the most part, in this movie.
Still, it had some laughs."
9270,Brick,8.5,With its hip lyrics and 50's styled character speak BRICK is an instant classic. It has a streak of REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE in it. The eclectic arrangement of the deranged is inventive and full of texture. I own it and watch it often!
9271,Virtuosity,8.0,"Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

While this is a trip in the way back machine, I think this going to remain a favorite of mine.

Akin to ""Back to the Future"", seeing what people thought the future would be 20 years ago is really interesting, and what's more is that we've pushed boundaries where something like this movie could happen.

We're probably still (2021) a ways away from digital silicone DNA, we're creating robots that are more and more life-capable and could have A.I. loaded into them to run a muck.

It's an interesting mix of sci-fi, action, and true crime style entertainment that I think should hold interest for most audiences."
9273,Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,5.0,Not any where as good as the 1st. It was ok. Not as funny. I guess I just didn't like the whole jungle theme.
9276,The Faculty,7.0,"Totally underrated, prime late 90s Sci-Fi/Horror/Comedy with an incredible cast that has somehow managed to stay under the radar even now, twenty years later on. _The Faculty_ is one of those movies I make everybody watch.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
9279,Jingle All the Way,6.0,"Your typical Christmas classic. A father waits to long to buy the most popular kids action figure turbo man. He goes out on Christmas eve to try to buy it and to no one's surprise, it is sold out."
9280,Femme Fatale,6.0,"** Contains spoilers **

Lower tier movie from De Palma that has some good direction and acting was... okay, but the ending still never quite worked even after seeing this again (third time if I recall). The whole it was all a dream felt like a cheat. On the other hand, as mainstream erotic-thrillers go, it's worth a watch if you're interested in that subgenre, it's not a bad way to spend 2 hours. **3.0/5**"
9281,Witness,10.0,"My Fiance is a Millennial and I've been trying to get her and her friends to watch some classic films. Some, Taxi Driver, Chinatown, The Godfather, Godfellas, The Princess Bride, Blazing Saddles were epic fails for a variety of reasons.

Witness actually stood the Millennial taste test for some reason, and this is significant because it is really hard to get them to watch or listen to anything that is older than 4 years.

That says something, I'm not sure what, but it was a film that they actually sat through.

It is also one of the tightest scripts Hollywood has produced, which is saying something since it was released in 1985 following almost a decade of the best movies that Hollywood has ever produced.

It's pure story, and that story is backed up with acting and directing making for a beautiful picture all around."
9282,11:14,,"A clever little thriller/black comedy, which holds interest. 11:14 tells the inter-connected stories of a group of people, all revolving around a tragic car-accident. We see the accident, which occurs at 11:14pm, from different perspectives, as the puzzle slowly comes together.

Sure, the story works a lot on coincidence, but it's still a great build up and interesting ending, despite it being somewhat of a let-down.

The very black humour includes two sections which might just be some of the most cringing moments for men in cinema history – one of them in particular had me cowering fear.

Good performances from Patrick Swayze and Hilary Swank make this a good cinematic treat."
9286,Final Destination 3,8.0,This has the best intro to a movie I have ever seen. I'm sure we all have thought about a disaster on a roller coaster at some point in our lives. When we are about to get on a roller coaster. It's a messed up thing to see but it's awesome to see it in this movie.
9290,Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles,5.0,"***Meh sequel, but a handful of genuine laughs***

Sue (Linda Kozlowski) has to fill-in at a newspaper in Los Angeles for a few weeks and so Mick (Paul Hogan) & their son tag along. Misadventures ensue as they investigate a dubious movie production company.

“Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles” (2001) is the final flick of the trilogy and easily the least. Hogan is still his genial self and Linda is more beautiful than ever at 42 (during shooting), inside and out, but too much of the story is flat and the the constant product placements are annoying. Still, it’s likable nonsense and I found myself busting out laughing at the goofy humor at least seven times.  

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in (big surprise) Australia and Los Angeles.

GRADE: C"
9292,Hudson Hawk,6.0,"Outrageous, if not inconsistent, slapstick comedy that has its charm I suppose and is a nice, easy watch if you're not looking for anything serious. However, I'd prefer putting on The Naked Gun if I was looking for something similar and done better. **3.0/5**"
9296,S1m0ne,6.0,"A good surprise, knowing that this was not a too good comedy. Pacino plays well his role in another middle age crisis stupid movie in the tradition of ""The Woman in Red"" or ""10""."
9298,Ali G Indahouse,7.0,"I'm not gonna stand here and tell you that _Ali G Indahouse_ is a good movie, but I've gotta be honest, I watch this movie at least once a year. I really am not a fan of basically every single thing that Sacha Baron Cohen has done since this, but sometimes, when I'm having a bad day, I sit down, chuck on _Ali G_ and comfortably feel like an idiot for a little while. Very luxurious.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
9303,Bound,9.0,"Easily the best film the Wachowskis have ever done. I heartily wish that they had stayed low-key, under the radar, and made great scorching films like this one."
9313,The Man in the Iron Mask,6.0,"The acting talents in this film cannot mask its weird dialogues and silly story.

5/10"
9319,The Last Boy Scout,,"I think this classic Tony Scott actioner with Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans just gets better and better when it gets older. I mean the film is nearly 30 years old and I have seen it at least a dozen of times and yet it managed to entertain me and fully packed Cinemadrome screening!It is written by Shane Black and I have to admit that this is Shane Black at his shaneblackest. The jokes are constant and witty and Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans make a great onscreen buddy couple. Not to mention great cavalcade of bad guys. If 80's and 90's action is your cup of tea, this is definitely something you need to see!"
9323,Ghost in the Shell,9.0,"In the 1990s, Ray Kurzweil wrote about his ""Singularity"" theory - the future when man and computer are wholly merged. His predictions of AI are perhaps only now coming to fruit. This 1995 movie is the original Ghost In The Shell, which I finally watched. Mamoru Oshii's masterpiece, based on a manga by Shirow Masamune, is not only consistent with Singularity theory, but also remarkably prescient. This is the first film to broach the tough question of ""what does it mean to be conscious?"" in the context of AI (Artificial Intelligence)."
9326,Romancing the Stone,7.0,"I guess I was a bit more impressed with the leads in this movie than the other reviewer here, for I think they held up their end of a story that is, if anything, even more of a take-off on action movies that the Raider franchise.

It is fluff, of course, with odd violence offsetting what is a rather gentle adventure. Good luck finding it on one of the streaming services out there. It is for sale or rent only at this time. I had a chance to watch it free, however, as I wasn’t about to buy or rent it. It is good, but not that good."
9334,The Scorpion King,4.0,"When _The Scorpion King_ first came out in '02, it would be hard to imagine that between this franchise and its forebears (_The Mummy_ & _The Mummy Returns_), that it would be _The Scorpion King_ who would continue to live on in the following decade. Though that's maybe less shocking knowing that _Tomb of the Dragon Emperor_ happened.

_Scorpion King_ delivers on a small amount of the hammy fun it could have been, though I can't help but wonder just how amazing it would be if we had gotten a _Fast & Furious_ level Rock portraying Mathayas.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
9334,The Scorpion King,5.0,"Spawned from the ""Mummy Returns"" this rather stolid and lurching drama tells the tale of “Mathayus” (Dwayne Johnson) an “Akkadian” - an ancient sort of Mesopotamian - who tries to overthrow the tyrant king “Memnon” (Steven Brand) who reigns with the aid of sorceress who can predict the future (Kelly Hu doing her best Jane Seymour impression). This is as formulaic as I've seen in this genre and leaves little for the imagination. It has humour, on occasion, but is anything but subtle. It's all just an action vehicle for the star that does look good but has little else to recommend it to anyone."
9335,Transporter 2,6.0,"Not quite as good with some outlandish action scenes but like Statham and Kate Nauta (Oregon gal as it turns out) is hot, though she is a model, and her ""acting"" shows it. Still thought it was fine all in all. **3.0/5 **"
9339,Click,10.0,Love the concept of this movie. I wish I can use it on my girlfriend it would be great. Adam Sandler makes great movies. Hilarious and sad but with a happy ending.
9340,The Goonies,8.0,"Such a classic!

Glad they shown this at the cinema when it reopened - it looked amazing in the big screen!"
9340,The Goonies,7.0,"Second time seeing this and while it's not quite the classic in my book, still a fun family-adventure flick with some nice production design and a nice cast along with some great talent behind the camera with Spielberg producing (and story), Chris Columbus's script and Richard Donner directing. Added bonus for me being an Oregonian and this filmed in Astoria. **3.5/5**"
9340,The Goonies,8.0,"""The Goonies"" kicks off strong with a great first act that really captures the energy of being a kid in the '80s.

It’s fun watching the group of teens hanging out, pranking each other, and getting into all kinds of creative mischief around the house. It’s a bit of a throwback to when kids actually spent time together in person, unlike today, where everyone’s glued to a screen. The story flows perfectly from one act to the next, thanks to Richard Donner’s solid directing. He’s known for classics like Superman, Lethal Weapon, and The Omen, so no surprise he nailed it here too.

Overall, this is a perfect pick for family movie night."
9342,The Mask of Zorro,7.0,"Solid swash-buckling action-adventure cast perfectly with Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones and finely directed by the great Martin Campbell. I don't remember much about its sequel, The Legend of Zorro, but kind of wished there would be one more to complete a trilogy (maybe titled Zorro's Last Ride?). In any case, was a fun ride and been a good decade plus the last time I watched. **3.75/5**"
9344,Kids,9.0,"Where and how am I going to start this review because it truly gives you the 😯😯🤯😳😮😵‍💫.  A few friends and I during the whole thing.  One thing for sure, it's a really good movie for teaching kids that bad decisions have incredibly worse consequences.  Although I do suggest watching it because it does actually grab your attention and keeps it.  If you have seen movies that were similar like ""Bully""  and liked it then I feel comfortable enough to that you will like this as well.     I know I will be adding to this review but for the moment that's all I have"
9349,Universal Soldier,6.0,"Some similarities with Terminator, still kind of a fun if not also messy sci-fi actioner, with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgin going head-to-head. Oh, and forgot how much of a crush I had on Ally Walker back then. Anyway, not bad but certainly a movie that feels like it was from the 90s. **3.25/5**"
9352,EuroTrip,7.0,"This might be one of the lesser of the teen sex comedies that came out of the success of the American Pie franchise and according to my previous rating I apparently didn't care for it, but with the Unrated version finally getting a Blu-ray release (previously only available on DVD), I had a good time with this one. It's not great and some things didn't work, I did like the core cast and some fun cameos. **3.25/5**"
9352,EuroTrip,8.0,Excusy excusy! This movie is so hilarious. Kind of a raunchy comedy. Stays pretty funny throughout film.
9353,Nacho Libre,6.0,"Not as fun as I expected it to be.

<em>'Nacho Libre'</em> does do some things well, Jack Black is good and the wrestling scenes are mostly nicely done. However, I didn't really dig the rest of it - whether it be the laughter lacking humour, or the uninteresting story with the orphanage. It is at least a relatively short flick, but it isn't one I'd be in a rush to rewatch."
9355,Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,8.0,"**The best of the Mad Max films**

High production values and a compelling story line make this the best of the series. This one doesn't rely on basic car smashes for the duration and instead gives us a moving and more thoughtful adventure.

No campy men dressed for the _Blue Oyster_ bar in this one, thank goodness. _The Road Warrior_ (1981) is widely regarded as the best but I have to disagree. That film had a very one note narrative that verged on the bland and an overload of homoerotic imagery.

This is a beautiful looking and entertaining film that does not have the shoddy and amateur vibe of the first two. _Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome_ is the film that the first should have been.


- Charles Dance"
9357,One Hour Photo,7.0,"The ending underwhelms slightly, though <em>'One Hour Photo'</em> is still worth a watch.

As great as Robin Williams' comedy is, I like the idea of seeing the guy act more serious - and he certainly did so in this 2002 release! The film starts are very strongly, I really enjoyed the vibe that was building. Williams plays a creepy character very well, while the rest of the cast - namely Connie Nielsen - support ably.

The movie does a drag a tiny bit the longer it goes on, despite only having a run time of around 90 minutes, and the conclusion didn't have as much of an impact as it should've. Still, I definitely got enough out of this one thanks to some good atmosphere building and a competent Williams performance."
9358,Final Destination 2,,"This is my least favorite out of the series. Just the main character doesn't sell her character to me in this. The death scenes were cool, but it was just an ok movie."
9360,Anaconda,6.0,"Yep hope I never see any giant anaconda In person. I would freak the hell out. Probably pee my pants too lol. It's a ok movie, but the snake does look fake. Either way I hate snakes."
9362,Tremors,8.0,"""Tremors"" joins ""Gremlins"" as one of a handful of family friendly creature features. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward have great chemistry as two bickering handymen in Perfection Nevada, population 14 when an invasion of subterranean ""graboids' (I know, I know ... that sounds ridiculous, but in the context of the movie it clicks).

Spawning an abundance of bad sequels, ""Tremors"" solid cast, story and excellent practical effects stands the test of time."
9362,Tremors,8.0,"""Tremors"" joins ""Gremlins"" as one of a handful of family friendly creature features. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward have great chemistry as two bickering handymen in Perfection Nevada, population 14 when an invasion of subterranean ""graboids' (I know, I know ... that sounds ridiculous, but in the context of the movie it clicks).

Spawning an abundance of bad sequels, ""Tremors"" solid cast, story and excellent practical effects stands the test of time."
9362,Tremors,8.0,"Tremors is a surprisingly appealing movie and I am not attributing it to the creatures in the film. It starts off giving a westerns vibe and then quickly turns into a survival horror movie with the added novelty of an unknown creature. Being a fan of 'creature features' and having watched most popular films in the genre, Tremors took me aback as it continued to impress me with its casting, plot, and the sheer horror of characters being hunted by a strange-looking mystery. There's just a positive, fun vibe to the film and that works wonders here. Gets all my points for being extremely funny too. **Grade A-**."
9362,Tremors,8.0,"Fun and entertaining horror-comedy that's light-hearted and features a great cast. For whatever reason never got around to seeing this one but can see why it's endured all these years (and spawned several sequels). For its time, good special effects. **3.75/5**"
9378,Thir13en Ghosts,6.0,"This is a movie I could've sworn I had seen before, but remember little about it, which does say something. Still, some interesting elements, the ghosts' designs, when you can appreciate them, have an almost Hellraiser-like quality to them, and never a bad thing having Tony Shalhoub in the lead even when I didn't once buy into the family dynamic.

Has the hallmarks of a a film from that era, with the direction (and camera angles) plus the inclusions of Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie franchise) and Matthew Lillard (Scream franchise) in there. Also, the twist at the end didn't make a lick of sense. That said, can't say I was ever bored and honestly, if anyone actually remembered this movie, the setting would make for a fun scare house (and using special glasses to see the entities) somewhere like at the Universal Horror Nights or w/e it's called.

**2.75/5**"
9378,Thir13en Ghosts,6.0,Pretty sweet movie. I'm glad they remade this movie. They have a lot of crazy spirits locked in there. I liked it!
9383,Hollow Man,8.0,Loved this movie. I never seen a concept for a movie like this. I wouldn't hate being invisible at all. I can also see how it would be frustrating to not be able to become normal again too.
9383,Hollow Man,6.0,"Kevin Bacon (""Sebastian Caine"") leads a team of scientists looking for ways to make living things invisible. When he decides to be the ultimate guinea pig, it all starts to go a bit wonky - they can make him disappear ok, but they cannot quite reverse the transaction. Needless to say, despite the best efforts of Elisabeth Shue (""Linda"") and Josh Brolin (""Matt"") he starts to go off the rails a bit, and with his new found abilities to go about undetected, he soon becomes quite a nasty piece of work determined to wreak retribution on his boss and his erstwhile colleagues. It's a rather daft slasher with plenty of clever skeletal effects and pace, but the dialogue and scenarios are pretty preposterous with little, if any, chemistry between any of the stars."
9386,In the Line of Fire,7.0,"I wish it was paced better, but <em>'In the Line of Fire'</em> still makes for a good time.

Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich is a great line-up and both are entertaining in this, the latter is just terrific at playing a loopy bad guy. There's a fair few well known peeps behind them, including John Heard and Gary Cole - it's a fairly strong cast.

The story is an interesting one, though given that you'd expect the film to move along at a better pace but it kinda just walks through its 128 minute run time. It's not a drag or anything, but I definitely wasn't on the edge of my seat unfortunately. It's still a film I'd recommend, though."
9387,Conan the Barbarian,8.0,"Though definitely a guilty pleasure from the cheesy 80's of which I grew up, this is such outstandingly fun. It's so unique a cinematic experience, knowing what we know of Schwarzenegger's life and career the 34 years since, seeing him at this juncture, as he's just starting out. (No, I haven't seen 'Stay Hungry' yet.)

Part of me always wishes he had simply stuck to these films (as well as the 'Terminator' series), and was still making them. In his prime, I dare you to find anyone better at this kind of material. Director Milius has a fine feel for the swords-and-sandals/fantasy worldscape this material requires. An excellent and underrated supporting cast is here at well to help Arnie out, too."
9398,Zoolander,10.0,Genuinely the funniest film I have ever seen and is surprisingly underrated.
9401,2 Days in the Valley,6.0,"If you like a movie with a bunch of quirky characters & a decent story of redemption of sorts, give this flick a see."
9401,2 Days in the Valley,6.0,"Some quirky moments, this ensemble interconnected crime-comedy was watchable and the performances from James Spader and Charlize Theron were highlights, but can't say anything really stuck with me. **3.0/5**"
9405,Double Team,4.0,"The expression on Rourke's face at the end was fantastic. Everything else was utterly terrible (the confusing plot, acting and the numerous, fucking basketball puns)."
9414,The Man Who Knew Too Little,7.0,Seen this a few times over the years and I needed some light-hearted entertainment. Movie pretty much relies all on Bill Murray. Not top shelf for him at all but I did find it pretty funny (plus Joanne Whalley was cute). **3.25/5**
9416,Money Talks,6.0,Just an ok movie. This movies about some stolen diamonds. It is pretty funny but it really could have been better.
9417,Wrongfully Accused,4.0,"I've seen this one before, likely either in theaters or on DVD in the late 90s. This is just another poorly made spoof movies to come out of the era and even with Leslie Nielsen in the lead and one of the men behind The Naked Gun series and Hot Shots (Pat Proft) writing (and directing), a lot of the jokes fall flat. I chuckled a couple of times here and there but otherwise found this a chore to sit through even with its short running time. **2.0/5**"
9426,The Fly,10.0,"What was his electric bill and how did he not blow out every fuse in his building?  Telepods must suck up a lot of juice.

Anyway, it's fun.  It is the typical 80s flick, with a plot that takes all of 5 minutes to get rolling and a cast that was talented and still cheap enough to throw in a sci-fi horror flick.

But, you know, it's also mindless fun, it's not exactly deep, it's about science, and about the dangers of it, that never really manages to actually examine the dangers of science in any significant way... it's more along the lines of Kafka's Metamorphosis, which has already been examined.

But it doesn't matter, because you are watching it for mindless entertainment."
9426,The Fly,10.0,"The Fly is so good. Successful futurism. Seems the Fallout games benefitted. 

The physical effects are amazing and fun. Do not watch if gore sensitive.

Why not build a smaller machine first to test on...flies, instead of going straight to human-sized machines and testing on baboons? They gotta be expensive. Mice? The ridiculous nature of the film is a delight. The performances entertain while enhancing the story (narrative). That guy is such an amazing douchebag. The film entertains and engages. Rare.

I'm high on science. Gena Davis is beautiful. Would bang if Brundleflymly."
9428,The Royal Tenenbaums,2.0,"Didn't get this film at a fundamental level, the humor felt kind of ham-fisted. Wasn't able to finish it."
9433,The Edge,8.0,"In a nutshell: A vastly underrated thriller / adventure with great performances from Hopkins and Baldwin. After about a third of the way in, it's a two man show with excellent pacing, you will not be disappointed..."
9437,Kiss the Girls,7.0,Not that bad of a movie. Gets involved in a sex ring. Alex Cross has to figure out if she a victim or a participant.
9437,Kiss the Girls,8.0,"Watched this one again last night and still holds up as a solid 1990s crime-thriller based on the James Patterson novel with a great cast headlined by Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd as well as Cary Elwes, Tony Goldwyn, Brian Cox, Jay O. Sanders and Jeremy Piven. **3.75/5**"
9437,Kiss the Girls,6.0,"Ashley Judd stood out with her strong performance, balancing vulnerability and determination really well. Morgan Freeman was great too, his calm, confident presence fits perfectly in roles like this, and he definitely carried a lot of the movie’s weight.

On the other hand, William Converse-Roberts, who played Dr. Wick Sachs wasn’t very convincing. For a character tied to such a disturbing element of the story, his performance lacked the intensity or depth needed to make it truly impactful. It felt like a missed opportunity to add more tension to the scene.

That said, the movie overall was cool. It had a solid pace, good production values, and kept me engaged throughout. While it’s not one of those thrillers that blows you away, it’s worth a watch"
9438,Mr. Magoo,6.0,"1.8 average rating on Letterboxd? Ouch! I agree it's not good, but damn that's low.

Leslie Nielsen is definitely the best part of the film, he plays the titular character very well. Jennifer Garner is also involved, but the support cast are all rather slack. The premise isn't, at least in my opinion, the worst I've ever seen but it's certainly pretty lacklustre and messy.

I don't actually think <em>'Mr. Magoo'</em> is <i>that</i> awful though, except for the scene featuring brownface of course. Overall, it's a simple watch - one that doesn't take much attention. Probably worth watching only for Nielsen, and perhaps the dog."
9446,Jungle 2 Jungle,6.0,"Everything about this is very meh.

I can't say there is anything about <em>'Jungle 2 Jungle'</em> that I liked or enjoyed, I don't think it is anything overtly terrible but it's just so boring. None of the cast are memorable, the plot is lazy and the pacing is well off. It does attempt heart, though it doesn't hit all that sharply.

The performances of Tim Allen (Michael) and Martin Short (Richard) - though not good - at least keep the film away from the depths of awful. I also think Sam Huntington (Mimi) is alright in this. There's also an appearance from Jumba Jookiba himself, David Ogden Stiers.

All in all, It's just a very basic and plain live-action production from Disney. The stereotypical 'jokes' don't help its cause, either."
9448,The Big Hit,,"I'm beginning to think that nobody on this site has a sense of humor or a brain. 

This movie is a parody of the rash of all too serious hitman and gangster movies of the nineties, specifically John Woo.  You aren't supposed to take anything about this movie seriously.  Everything about this movie is mocking the genre including editing, action scenes and continuity.

Think  Pootie Tang meets the Naked Gun. 

I guess you have to be GenX or before to get it.  

Now get off my lawn."
9450,Brassed Off,7.0,"A touching drama of a declining mining community in Margaret Thatcher's Britain. Pete Postlethwaite is subtle but forceful in his portrayal of ""Danny""; the leader of the Grimley Colliery Band - one of the traditional brass bands that usually accompanied each mine in the North of England, much a there is a choir usually associated with a Welsh one. The story marries the inevitability of the mine closure with the impact on family and relationships throughout this close knit community and uses their band rehearsals as the axis for the plot. Tara Fitzgerald, Ewan McGregor, Philip Jackson and Jim Carter all contribute genuinely to this frequently dryly-humoured ensemble effort and by the end we are all too familiar with Rodrigo's ""Concerto de Orange Juice""."
9451,Election,8.0,"<em>'Election'</em> builds relatively slowly though really does become a fun movie by its conclusion. It's most definitely worth a watch.

Matthew Broderick is excellent throughout, as are the likes of Reese Witherspoon and Chris Klein. The films goes to some unexpected places and manages to make it work. And there's a great callback in there too. I will say that I didn't love the internal monologue bits, but they didn't derail the film for me in any major way."
9453,Caligula,8.0,"Land sakes!!!

They don't make films like this anymore...and that's a dirty rotten shame! =)"
9453,Caligula,9.0,Walk through a Bosch painting and marvel at the excesses and debauchery.  Critics don't take this seriously because a porn producer snipped it up and inserted his own scenes. It is what it is.  A near masterpiece.
9461,Enter the Dragon,8.0,Really fun martial arts action-thriller with Bruce Lee doing great work as usual in his final film. Not usually a big fan of the genre but still found this thoroughly enjoyable and engaging from beginning to end. **4.0/5**
9471,Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.0,"Really poor sequel that has outlandish action scenes and lame jokes. If there's such a thing as a movie that epitomizes the early 2000s, this is it. Maybe it's my older age, but the T&A aspect holds little weight anymore. **1.75/5**"
9471,Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,7.0,Not as good as the 1st. It was still pretty funny. The sexy trio's fight scenes were a little better in this one.
9477,King Arthur,8.0,"Do yourself a favour and grab the **extended **edition of this movie, It's like a whole new film and it is way way better.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
9477,King Arthur,,I'll never forget the iced-held river scene. At least I've watched it ten times.Clive Owen and Keira Knightley are my favorites.
9479,The Nightmare Before Christmas,6.0,"I suppose I missed watching it at the proper time so I will explain it as not surviving well after all these years.

The idea is daring, the stop motion is OKish and Danny Elfman's OST is quite good but even being only 70 min they were still too many for me. Specially, the songs were to close one to the next."
9480,Daredevil,2.0,"It's not just that Daredevil is a poorly made movie. It's that it takes a great character and turns him into a mishmash of tired clichés, shamelessly copying The Crow, Spider-Man, The Matrix, as well as both Burton and Schumacher's Batman in an attempt to appeal to the teen angst crowd. Don't blame Ben Affleck. He does what he can but the script and terrible production design lets him down as much as it us."
9480,Daredevil,6.0,"While the style and direction are very early 2000s in the superhero genre, I still found this relatively entertaining though seeing this again after many years, don't think Affleck was great in the role, though I did like Jennifer Garner's Elektra. As a side note, I did watch the director's cut. **3.25/5**"
9481,The Bone Collector,7.0,"Probably my least favorite Denzel move. Nevertheless, both him and Angelina Jolie deliver a better than average performance in an interesting crime thriller. Nothing else to praise here."
9481,The Bone Collector,7.0,Entertaining enough crime-thriller with both Washington and Jolie giving fine performances. Nothing outstanding and the dark mood doesn't always work (did like Craig Armstrong's score which I still listen to on my iPod). The ultimate reveal of the killer was a tad weak but otherwise it was okay. **3.25/5**
9481,The Bone Collector,8.0,"**A sinister killer and ominous tone cement The Bone Collector as one of the best crime thrillers of the 90s.**

The Bone Collector is one of the best thriller mystery movies out there! This eerie game of cat and mouse captivates its audience with its fast and foreboding pace and incredible performances from Denzel Washington and a young Angelina Jolie. Despite being over 20 years old and the flashy technology showcased as cutting age being very dated, The Bone Collector this thrills to this day thanks to its horrifying kills, surprising twists, and gripping tension. Critics weren't fans, and even user reviews are split, but I have no shame in recommending this dark atmospheric mystery to anyone looking for a creepy crime thriller."
9486,Johnny English,7.0,"Last seen this several years ago, probably when it was released in 2003, and pretty funny thanks to Rowan Atkinson. Not great but makes for a fun watch on a weekend when it's too hot to do anything outside. **3.5/5**"
9487,A Bug's Life,6.0,"The like... sixth-best version of _Seven Samurai_ to date. 

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9487,A Bug's Life,8.0,"A thoroughly enjoyable production from Disney and Pixar.

<em>'A Bug’s Life'</em> cobbles together nice animation, fun characters and a memorable voice cast. The premise is entertaining, as the film flies through its 95 minute run time. The score is pretty solid, also.

Dave Foley is good in the role of Flik, while Kevin Spacey is actually great as Hopper; shame about the actor himself, obviously. There's a load of other noteworthy members of the voice cast, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Atta), Hayden Panettiere (Dot), Bonnie Hunt (Rosie) and John Ratzenberger (P.T.) as well as many others - one of the studios' best casts.

I actually prefer, somewhat controversially I guess, <em>'Antz'</em> to this - only marginally though, as I truly like them both. I'd say watch the pair, if you can!"
9487,A Bug's Life,5.0,I'm not really into a lot of kid movies. My daughter made me watch this with her. It was a ok movie. It was something different to see. I'd probably never watch it again unless of course my daughter wants me to again.
9488,Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams,5.0,"Decent watch at best, probably won't watch again, but can recommend for a younger audience.

In traditional sequel fashion, this was worse than the original.  It feels like it actually has a richer, more complex story to it with a better message of cooperation and right over wrong, but it relies too heavily on weird effects combined with a lack of technology working in the story.

What really sets it apart is cross competitiveness with a secondary kid team, which was really cool to suddenly see a young Emily Osment (""Young and Hungry"").  And Steve Buscemi shows up as a mad scientist which is interesting all to itself.

The movie has its high points, but I feel like you spend far more time in the valleys."
9490,Half Baked,6.0,Cant lie I still like to get high and watch this movie. Really there's no other way to watch it. The movie isn't funny when your sober. Drunk even it's funny.
9491,Blue Steel,7.0,"Though this had plausibility issues one could drive a truck through, I enjoyed this movie despite itself. I really enjoyed Jamie Lee Curtis and Ron Silver's charisma and acting, both when they were falling in love and later when they were at each other's throats. Very good soundtrack by Brad Fiedel--surprisingly, I liked it much more than Tangerine Dream's work in Bigelow's earlier Near Dark. If you can forgive the plot holes and just go along for the ride, it's a surprisingly rewarding film."
9491,Blue Steel,5.0,"Normally a werewolf movie will have more werewolves in it than this.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
9491,Blue Steel,10.0,"Kathryn Bigelow did this, which stands to reason has to be pretty good. She has yet to make a movie that is unwatchable, and in the 1990s she hit her stride.

And you can tell it was Bigelow, because Silver actually had a decent performance and Curtis shows her dramatic credentials and proves she is more than just a scream queen... but more importantly Ron Silver does a good job and I've only seen him deliver meh at best.

But in the end, you still have to take it for what it is, a tense thriller like so many others you have seen before, but a tense thriller with some real class behind it that throws out some seriously great performances, anxiety inducing tension, and lighting that is surprisingly naturalistic for a cheap thriller.

With any other director this might have been a bad movie, but Bigelow really delivers."
9493,Twins,7.0,"Fun and all around enjoyable comedy that doesn't devolve into cheap humor (i.e. constant jokes about their height for instance) and instead two opposites working well off of one another. Schwarzenegger is great as sweet innocent and naïve while Devito as a schemer and crook still was likeable. **3.75/5**

I think I had seen this sometime back in the 90s but didn't remember much of it."
9493,Twins,6.0,"It's... fine?

Not as good as it was hyped up to be in my opinion. The movie was okay, but it wasn't anything special. It had _a story_ but it wasn't outstanding. The same goes for every other aspect of the movie. Worth watching if it's your thing, even if only for DeVito's performance, which is probably the best bit of the movie.

There are definitely parts of the movie that heavily rely on Marnie's attractiveness instead of the storyline and acting, trying to play it off as comedic when Julius doesn't understand what's going on- but that's obviously not what's going on here.

Overall, 6/10. Movie is fine, worth watching, but I don't think I would ever list it in a top movies list or anything."
9495,The Crow,9.0,"This is my first viewing of The Crow and it is a great, dark comic book adaptation that at times reminded me of Batman and moments that seemed to later inspire The Dark Knight, in particular with The Joker. It's a shame about Brandon Lee as he is amazing in the lead and this could've led to a great career. There are some poignant scenes and a genuine heart at its core. Just a home run from Alex Poyas. **4.25/5**"
9495,The Crow,9.0,"Great! All the more impressive given offscreen events.

The awful behind the scenes stuff with lead Brandon Lee was all that I knew about <em>'The Crow'</em>; I only learned it was a superhero flick in the lead-up to watching it, I had always assumed it was a straight up horror. No better time to watch it, what with the reboot out now... gotta see the sequels first!

There is a strong performance from Lee in there, Ernie Hudson is also someone I enjoyed in this. The rest of those onscreen are all positives, namely Rochelle Davis and Michael Wincott. I don't have any real complaints with this as a film, the feel is aesthetically, audibly and tonally spot on - plenty of Evanescence/Bring Me to Life and Gotham City vibes."
9501,Crying Freeman,5.0,"This is some pretty classic 90s, I love Mark Dacascos, and if you think you can sort of visualise in your head what a 1990s Mark Dacascos as an unwilling assassin with a mystic tattoo romancing a woman he was supposed to kill might look like, and go ""Yeah that's what I like in a movie"" then, well it is that, so sure, give it a try. But if you go ""I only like good stories told in a three-act structure with human characters"" then maybe don't. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
9502,Kung Fu Panda,9.0,"Wow, what a surprise this was! It looked like the stupidest movie ever by the trailers. Bit then when you actually sit down and watch it, it's not only one if the funniest, but also one of the most mature, profound, intense, action packed films you'll ever see! The perfect example of a ""Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover"" movie.

         **Total Score: 9.5/10**"
9504,Glengarry Glen Ross,7.0,"Interesting adaptation of a theater play with a great cast for a choral movie. The script is not that interesting, from my POV, but this is a story for actors and the cast is great."
9504,Glengarry Glen Ross,10.0,"Incredibly realistic mood… It captures the environment of a sales team so well… The stress, the competition, the somewhat adversarial relationship between management and the front office…

The predatory, hunter-gatherer nature of it all

Such a great film…"
9504,Glengarry Glen Ross,8.0,"Good David Mamet written film, with the usual Mamet-style dialogue, that doesn't have a real plot and not quite a character study either, yet still engrossing even with characters who are real estate scammers. Seen this several times over the years and still mesmerized by Jack Lemmon's performance. Pacino was good but Lemmon deserved the nod over him. **4.0/5**"
9506,Anger Management,7.0,"Pretty good movie. I was angry, mad, surprised, and laughed a lot. Whos's that pretty girl in that window there....What window where! Lol!"
9509,Man on Fire,5.0,His bodyguard style is much entertaining. I could watch it all up until certain point. Then it seems Denzels character goes against his usual serious bodyguard style. Only to progress the plot. That is when I turn this movie off
9509,Man on Fire,9.0,"_""Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting.""_

Denzel is always amazing in any movie. Most of this movies are just top tier as is, but this one really sticks out to me now that I am a parent. I would have this kind of fire in me if anything happened to my kid. The colors, editing, acting, even the violence is perfect in this."
9513,Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties,6.0,Ok movie. I like it better when he messes with Odie. It was like they were trying to be more cute in this movie.
9531,Superman III,9.0,"**Great sequel!**

A funny, exciting Superman movie that includes the greatest scene in the franchise - the junkyard fight between Evil Supes and his nerdy counterpart, Clark Kent.

Richard Pryor is hilarious as the hapless Gus Gorman - the computer programming genius with a heart. Robert Vaughn makes for a great villain and the special effects are top notch.

So much more entertaining than the tedious bile that would come in later years - Superman Returns and the Henry Cavill rubbish.

I remember sitting in the packed theater in 1983 and the whole audience thoroughly enjoying this - laughing and cheering in all the right places.

And for those who claim the film is too silly - do they not remember Ned Beatty as the cretin Otis in Superman and Superman II - surely the stupidest character to grace the series.

- Charles Dance"
9532,Final Destination,10.0,Love this movie. A person has visions of a disaster or people dieing. All his visions come true. This one is my favorite out of the series.
9533,Red Dragon,7.0,"This might seriously be the only good thing Brett Ratner has ever done. I don't even mean movies he's made, just like, thing he's done. Ever. In his life. Doesn't live up to the book, or to _Silence of the Lambs_ (though that second part took me a while to figure out), but I watch this thing semi-regularly and I haven't gotten sick of it yet. 

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
9539,Martyrs,5.0,"Rated this 5/10 due to large amounts of repeated and gratuitous violence.

Is it worth torturing people to find out if there is life after death?
This movie's answer seems to be ""Keep doubting""."
9539,Martyrs,8.0,"I wrote this once to describe my philosophy on what movies/TV I like: 

""Ravenous fan of dark, edgy movies & TV. They should glue you to the screen and stay in your dreams.""

Martyrs is one of a handful that describes that perspective to the T, and it is the kind of horror movie that you should go in completely clueless about the plot to enjoy the many twists that you won't see coming. 

A big caveat: this is ""advanced"" horror -- gut-wrenching, gory and very disturbing. Definitely not for everybody."
9539,Martyrs,6.0,"<b>64/100</b>

<i>Martyrs</i> delivers an intriguing and original concept but doesn't quite reach its full potential. It borrows a page from <i>Terrifier</i>'s playbook by dispatching the superior actress early which leaves a noticeable performance void. The third act hits a bit of a lull, but rebounds with a gripping and shocking climax that's sure to leave an impression. While it may not fully flesh out (no pun intended) its premise, <i>Martyrs</i> is worth a watch for horror fans looking for a unique and unsettling experience."
9540,Dead Ringers,9.0,"Sheer brilliance. Deep down, EVERYONE has a love/hate thing about identical twins. On the one side, they wish they had that kind of communion with someone, that sort of magical intimacy they share, having someone basically the exact same as themselves...yet that same one-of-a-kind companionship is scary as hell.

I haven't seen, from my fellow Canadian, either 'Scanners' (1981) or 'Naked Lunch' (1991), so I can't honestly say whether or not my assertion can be thus extended, but I dare ANYONE to find in horror a finer run than Cronenberg had, in 'Videodrome', 'The Dead Zone', 'The Fly'...and this, 'Dead Ringers'."
9540,Dead Ringers,4.0,"David Cronenberg reveals himself to be a total pseud. ""Our identities blur together. We are one soul."" Give me a break"
9542,The Hitcher,7.0,"Solid enough suspense-thriller with great action and menacing performance from Rutger Hauer, a few moments in the story felt a bit clunky, mainly how Jennifer Jason Leigh's character gets involved, which I will say the 2007 remake at least improved upon. Just a highly entertaining flick. **3.5/5**"
9543,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,5.0,"It's very, very bad but I guess I was in just the right mood for it because I actually kind of enjoyed watching _Prince of Persia_. I can't pinpoint even a single good thing about it, whereas I can immediately conjure many of its failings, but I just remember having some fun. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
9544,FearDotCom,6.0,This was your 1st attempt at an online scary movie. It's a ok movie. More like a suspense movie then a horror film. A website that kills you if you visit it.
9552,The Exorcist,6.0,"**Shocking rather than frightening.**

Friedkin's The Exorcist is a film that shocks rather than scares. A well made film that achieved notoriety via pea soup. A slow and intelligent film with strong performances - yet also a mostly disappointing one for those who dare to go beyond the hype and actually _experience_ it for the first time. 

For a film that _does_ succeed in frightening the audience and with none of the hype - I recommend The Changeling starring George C Scott. Now **THAT** is a scary movie."
9552,The Exorcist,10.0,"The 4K restoration of The Exorcist is absolutely stunning. Every frame has been enhanced to reveal richer textures, making the eerie details of Regan's demonic possession even more unsettling. The colours in key scenes are now more vivid, adding depth to the already tense atmosphere. Iconic moments, such as Father Merrin's arrival under the streetlight and Regan's head spin, have been revitalized, making them feel even more intense. The film's haunting interiors, from Regan's dimly lit bedroom to the unsettling atmosphere of Father Karras's moments of doubt, now have a newfound clarity that enhances the immersive terror."
9556,Darkman,7.0,"Enter Darkman.

Sam Raimi’s trial run for the Spider-Man franchise is a whole bunch of fun. Liam Neeson plays Dr. Peyton Westlake, a super scientist who after a major run-in with the villainous Robert G. Durant (Larry Drake), reinvents himself as Darkman, a super-anti-hero who sets about ridding L.A. of its mobsters.

It’s a comic book film that isn’t based on a comic book, Raimi inventing his own tortured protagonist whilst homaging similar beings of eras past. All the silliness of such fare is here of course, overblown violence and colourful characters are frequent, but there’s good thought gone into the revenge theme, while the action sequences are often excellent. The pace hardly sags, as Raimi’s creations move about a Los Angeles that is equally decaying or affluent, and in Neeson the story has a lead actor with swagger, pathos and emotional force in abundance. 7/10"
9556,Darkman,10.0,"This is interesting... this is one of those B-Movie gems that is packed full of pro-talent before they really became pro-talent. And that is right down to the Cohens who did uncredited script polishing.

This is worth the watch, even if you are one of those people that hates B-movies... wrongly hates.

And, it's a comic book movie, it is over the top, it is campy, it packs serious action into a short little plot that still manages to be compelling. The MCU could take lessons on story crafting from this."
9556,Darkman,7.0,"Seen this one a few times over the years and while some scenes were really cheesy due to the visual effects of that era, it still is quite entertaining and solid performances from Neeson and McDormand even with some of the overly dramatic dialogue especially from Neeson. Fine way to spend 90-minutes still."
9558,King of New York,8.0,"Incredibly acted and beautifully stylized. Really enjoyed this entry in the 90s crime era, one of the best in my opinion."
9558,King of New York,6.0,"Shoulda loved it, didn't.

The violent nature of <em>'King of New York'</em> is its strongest element, though otherwise I found this to be unsatisfying. A lot happens but none of it really clicked for me, while I held very little interest in any of the characters - despite an exceptional cast list.

Christopher Walken, Laurence Fishburne, Wesley Snipes, Steve Buscemi and Giancarlo Esposito are all in there, yet none of their performances shone through to me to be honest. Walken is the obvious standout, though that's only via a process of elimination.

Gritty gangster flicks would usually be my thing, but for some reason this 1990 release disappointed me."
9563,Any Given Sunday,7.0,Love sports movies. Especially when there's a lot of football in it. This goes through a whole seasons worth. Love it!
9566,The Fan,5.0,"What was a pretty good 3/4, the last act was too ridiculous to take seriously. Still as a whole fine performances from both De Niro and Snipes even if neither were in top form, but at least appeared to be trying instead of phoning it in as both have done in the past decade or so.

Also a testament, as I could never see the NFL doing this, for the MLB to allow licensing on their teams with a fan, albeit a psychopath (or is it sociopath?), being portrayed that way. **2.75/5**"
9568,The Dentist,6.0,"Not the movie to watch before visiting the dentist. Not the strongest script but the horror elements were great and Corbin Bersen was a lot of fun, a stark contrast to his roles on L.A. Law and Psych. **3.0/5**"
9571,Dazed and Confused,9.0,"Really solid sophomore effort by Linklater.

Loved his Hitchcock homage, especially."
9573,Blood Work,7.0,"Good entertainment.

I like the plot of <em>'Blood Work'</em>. I'm unsure if it would hold up if you went through with a fine-tooth comb, but it certainly gave me the required enjoyment levels. Clint Eastwood gives a sturdy performance, as do Jeff Daniels and Wanda De Jesus; elsewhere on the cast, neat to see Anjelica Huston and Rick Hoffman, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Suits_characters#:~:text=Faye%20to%20leave.-,Louis%20Litt,-%5Bedit%5D"" rel=""nofollow"">Louis Litt</a> himself, appear in smaller roles.

It's not as unpredictable as it perhaps thinks it is, due to the casting more than anything, but I had a fun enough time with it."
9582,A Guy Thing,5.0,"Decent watch, might watch again, but hard to recommend.

Don't get me wrong, I like the movie: it's well casted, has a decent story and production value, but even at the time of release, it wasn't great.

There are some really funny moments, and if I were Jason Lee, I think I would have some trouble choosing between Selma Blair and Julia Stiles too, but it's mostly ""what awful things can we do to him"" humor.  Ants under a magnifying glass just aren't all that satisfying.

The upside is that there are some very cleverly crafted characters and acting even beyond that.

There are plenty of probably better movies out there, especially after all this time."
9586,The Bonfire of the Vanities,3.0,"This movie is utter tripe and ruins a great book.
It’s such a mess. Avoid at all costs.
Edward E.Grant does his overacting routine which is really cringeworthy and bombastic!

Avoid!!"
9587,Little Women,8.0,"Moderately faithful to the books, this movie does well to maintain the magic in a 90s cinematography capsule. It has excellent casting and hosts very strong performances from all.
A lovely piece of media."
9592,Open Water 2: Adrift,3.0,"The jump in video quality from the first _Open Water_ movie to this one is **astounding**. But it's still real bad. Plus, this isn't even a shark movie! I know it isn't specifically touted to be one, but I was still very surprised. Honestly, I think what happened here was someone wanted to make a very stupid movie, but were then informed that a movie, near identical in both plot and stupidity, already existed, and to cover their tracks, they quickly decide all of a sudden that this movie was a ""sequel"" to the original _Open Water_. I guess it was kind of cool seeing the guy that plays Loki/Gabriel in Supernatural in another role, but I can't imagine that's a thing that'll carry much weight with audiences in general.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
9592,Open Water 2: Adrift,7.0,"This is not a shark movie as I had thought nor a related sequel to the equally charming first instalment in the Open Water series, but it did get me hooked quickly when a group of friends impulsively decide to take a dive in open waters without lowering the ladder on their yacht. It's crazy how things move from there with basic instincts kicking in and the blame game starting up. It's solid entertainment if you are into survival thrillers. Has a few clichés here and there, but overall Adrift gave me a good 90 minutes of pure thrills. (Grade B). TN."
9593,Last Action Hero,6.0,"Having just watched this for the first time in 2018, I wonder if Arnold Schwarzenegger had intended for this to be a sort of retirement movie. It very much has that vibe, and would have worked spectacularly to that end in a fun, meta, kind of way. But for better (_Maggie_) or worse (_Terminator 3_) Arnie just keeps on sluggin' and that's the world we live in.

So instead of that, I guess _Last Action Hero_ is really just a deconstruction of the over the top action movies the 80s and early 90s did with such aplomb. Is it a scathing criticism of them, or a love letter to them? I don't know, but _Last Action Hero_ works for me, and that's all I'm taking away from it.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9594,Double Impact,4.0,"So there is a line in here that I identify with: ""Never in my life would I wear black silk underwear,"" and that really needs to be your only take away.

Because, honestly, what could be worse than Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting? Twice as much of Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting. There are two stars of this movie and he is both of them.

However, it does hit most of the tropes of boobs, fights, and guns. The only down side is that even with hitting all the tropes, it's still pretty unwatchable, even for a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie."
9598,Babe,1.0,Truly disgusting type of entertainment that inspires vegetarianism! It also has a scene too much to be in a children’s film that reflects on domestic violence (between two dogs). The producers who made this sort of junk were obviously nuts in the head to put such a scene like this into such family oriented film. Please do not watch after seeing this review. You do not especially want to get inspired by such propaganda about using certain animals as food.
9599,The Blob,8.0,"Nifty remake of the 1958 classic. This story of a shapeless, featureless space alien, instead of the usual ""little green men"", opens the door for a decidedly different kind of invasion movie. This version stays pretty true to the original and the advancement of special effects over 30 years allows for some really great and gory kills. The best being a victim being pulled into a sink drain and a wicked attack of a main character in a doctor's office.

There are some effects that aren't so good though, you'll scoff when you see them. The acting is really very good, and it's got its share of moments that are actually scary. The characters, even the primaries, could get swallowed up at any time. I'd say this is a must watch for any fan of the original."
9599,The Blob,5.0,"The best joke was when they described the Blob as ""a plasmic life form growing at a geometric rate."" 😂 I even just laughed while writing it down 😂

Other than that, pretty bad. And the campiness doesn't feel fresh for long, turning it into a rather boring watch right when it's supposed to start to be exciting.

Still, worth a watch."
9599,The Blob,9.0,"This is definitely the most brutal horror film I've ever seen and one of the best aswell. The effects in this film are top notch and the storyline is much stronger than the original, the acting is more believable too. This film is nothing short of a horror classic."
9600,Big Momma's House,8.0,"Before there was Madea, there was Martin Lawrence as Big Momma. I love this movie. Freaking hilarious."
9602,Coming to America,5.0,"Hasn't aged flawlessly, made some stylistic decisions that probably would have come across as weird even at the time, and not the sort of thing (American comedy) that typically appeals to me. But I can still absolutely see why _Coming to America_ is remembered as fondly as it is. I liked it by and large more than the most similar offerings of today.

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._"
9602,Coming to America,7.0,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

A very good approach to a ""Pauper and Prince"" trope mix with a culture shock trope.  The excellent cast involved really takes it a long way with good writing to help it along.

It's admittedly not a very original story structure, so while it is not all that refreshingly unpredictable, but it's good to see a foreign royalty in an American setting, and an African one at that.

I do think this is consistently funny and has maintained over 30 years, so definitely check this out if you haven't."
9602,Coming to America,,"_Coming to America_ is a classic 80's comedy with excellent performances by Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall. The film's humor holds up well over time, and the duo's ability to portray a variety of different characters is impressive. While some aspects of the film may be dated, it remains a hilarious and heartwarming story about love and acceptance. Overall, _Coming to America_ is a timeless classic and one of the greatest comedies of the 80’s. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh."
9603,Clueless,7.0,"I remember growing up watching this movie. I liked it for probably different reasons then others like it. I liked it because I hated girls like her. So I thought she just looked ridiculous the whole movie which made it funny to me. Favorite line: ""Why would I listen to you? Your a virgin that can't drive!"" LoL!"
9604,Red Heat,7.0,"Entertaining enough buddy-cop movie has some fun action scenes (the bus chase sequence was great). Only thing holding it back was the pairing of Schwarzenegger and Belushi never quite worked for me. Still a good flick from Walter Hill, though not sure it ranks all that high compared with others from the era. **3.5/5**"
9606,Metropolis,3.0,Style carefully cared but the plot is expectable and the dialogues cheesy.
9612,Coneheads,10.0,"Coneheads, yeah, it's one of the FEW SNL movies that turned out right, especially since it came so long after the Conehead sketches stopped airing.

But then it was back before SNL made it's downward spiral to the dust bin.

It has an all star cast, and in even the small roles. It has a cast that was, more or less, the who is who of comedy in the early 90s, and is executed in way that actually tells a story... and that is what sets it apart from a lot of SNL movies (more modern movies in general), it actually tells a coherent story and takes the time to develop the characters.

Because of that, you have a sense of real family and their plights have a meaningful resonance that only comes with the well developed mind of a skilled writer and director."
9614,Happy Gilmore,10.0,"Adam Sandler makes so many good movies. Who doesn't love this movie. If you don't like this, then there's something wrong with you. The price is wrong bitch!"
9615,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,5.0,"My wife loves the franchise... I'm 3 deep and really not seeing the appeal.  But, I do like the accent, it's a rarity that you see a film with a southern accent on the lead, and that is refreshing.  Especially out in Japan, or anywhere that has an American abroad.

The High school thing wasn't so much my speed.  Neither was the reason why he ended up in Japan, where the problems he would have with driving and racing were resolved with... a phone call.

And then I spent the majority of the time watching this and wondering how much money people in Japan spend on front end alignments and that was about as challenging as the movie got for me.  Otherwise it was pretty paint by numbers from start to finish.

But hey, the colors popped."
9616,The Order,3.0,"Oof.

Kind of feels like the pitch meeting for this one basically went:

""So I was just reading about the idea of this 'Sin Eater' thing on Wikipedia the other day, it actually sounds really interesting, I'm super keen to put it in a movie!""

""Oh great, so what's the story gonna be?""

""I'm sorry the what?""

""The story. You can't just say you're gonna put a Sin Eater in 'a movie' you have to like... Actually make the movie that it goes in. What's the movie gonna be about?""

""...Oh no.""

""I mean it'll probably be fine.""

""Right? It'll probably be fine.""

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
9620,Paycheck,4.0,"Oh dear, this one's pretty bad. There are a lot of faces in this movie but non of them could save this disaster. Which is a shame, because this could have been a really intense and thrilling film in the hands of a different director. Instead, it comes across as a made-for-TV movie. John Woo's direction is lacklustre and cliche, the editing is lazy and the soundtrack is overblown, unfitting and downright intrusive."
9621,Elizabethtown,7.0,"Charming if not uneven romantic-drama-comedy that has its moments though Orlando Bloom's narration felt stilted at times, but I liked his interactions with Kirsten Dunst. A bit weak compared with Cameron Crowe's other works, still liked it enough. **3.5/5**"
9622,Beverly Hills Ninja,7.0,I forgot how funny this movie is. I used to watch this all the time. Still as funny now as it was back then.
9645,Ghost Ship,3.0,"I remember thinking this was good as a child... I was wrong.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._"
9645,Ghost Ship,5.0,"Another second viewing flick, wasn't a big fan the first time and basically thought the same now. There are some fun cheesy moments here and there but kind of like Thirteen Ghosts (same director), has some interesting ideas that don't amount to much. Course, I'm also not much of a fan of supernatural horror movies as they play fast and loose with the rules. **2.5/5**"
9645,Ghost Ship,6.0,"Besides **THAT** epic death scene, this movie is mildly entertaining. It has flaws and a terrible story, which I admit the reveal was amusing. If you like terror on the seas but amusingly bad to riff on, this’ll be the movie. That opening scene is memorable for a reason though and basically overshadowed the rest of the movie."
9645,Ghost Ship,6.0,The beginning and the end of this movie is really the only good thing about the movie. Everything else is just a crew chasing around a ghost girl trying to figure out what happened to her. Pretty boring.
9647,Scrooged,8.0,"""Scrooged"" has been suggested by ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens and the familiar themes this film tackles are becoming increasingly relevant with the passing of each year as the human race becomes even more isolated and jaded than ever before by the unceasing and repetitive grinds and demands of daily life where considerations such as kindness and a generosity of spirit are fading fast and in danger of never being recovered after they have been lost. This film attempts to address the malaise and remind people that life is only worth living when it is done with a genuine sense of charity towards other people and this shouldn't be restricted to just one day of the year. The Christmas spirit can and should be adopted as a lifestyle choice and the repeated attempts to attain this goal ought to be the only insatiable greed in the world today."
9651,Supergirl,5.0,"<em>'Supergirl'</em> is a second straight dud from this franchise, though I'd honestly say it's ever so slightly more interesting than the preceding <em>'Superman III'</em>; it at least tries to tell a coherant story around its main character, which can't exactly be said for the aforementioned.

Helen Slater is decent as Supergirl, any complaints with the character lie with how she is written rather than how she is portrayed by Slater. The best part of this movie, for me, is actually Faye Dunaway. Selena isn't necessarily a plus, though I think Dunaway's performance held potential.

Peter O'Toole has a small part to play, nice to have an actor like him involved - on a similar note, it's a shame Christopher Reeve turned down a cameo, not that you could blame him of course. All in all, this is a disappointing movie. A shorter run time might've helped, fwiw."
9654,The Italian Job,8.0,"**The Italian Job is a cool, sleek action-packed film with a fantastic cast and incredible stunts.**

The Italian Job achieves the impossible - making mini coopers cool! With a cast filled with stars from Mark Wahlberg to Jason Statham to Charlize Theron, this high-paced, high-energy film oozes swagger and awesomeness. This close-knit band of thieves is on a mission of revenge to steal from the man that betrayed them all and murdered their leader. With the moral high ground and proper motivation, these characters become that much cooler and are that much easier to root for as they break the rules in pursuit of their quarry. The stunt driving and camera work meld together perfectly to create a stunning high-octane movie that is exciting, fun, and worth seeing again and again."
9654,The Italian Job,8.0,"Seen this one a few times over the years and still holds up as a light-hearted and fun heist-thriller. The ensemble cast with Wahlberg, Theron, Green and Mos Def, all have great chemistry. A shame the planned sequel never came to fruition, though surprised Paramount hasn't attempted to do one even if they could only bring back a couple actors like Wahlberg and Theron. Still distracting watching Norton knowing he was forced into doing this movie. And maybe sacrilege but I prefer this one over the 1969 original. **4.0/5**"
9656,Black Christmas,5.0,"Obviously doesn't hold a candle to the original, and some of the acting is pretty genuinely bad, but it knows what it wants and it goes for it. What it wants, here being: To be hamstrung to keeping in step with its predecessor but also being wildly different enough to piss anyone off who was expecting an actual ""remake"".

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
9659,Mad Max,9.0,"Who'd have thought we'd still be talking about a $350,000 film, 40 years after it was made? And who'd have thought it would be in a positive way.
_Mad Max_ was one of the most formative films ever released, and not only is **one of** my favourite films, but is chief inspiration to my **actual** favourite film of all time, Neil Marshall's _Doomsday_.

_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._"
9659,Mad Max,8.0,"For whatever reason, never had seen the original and doesn't disappoint, some good action and gut wrenching scenes defying the rules of killing pets and kids, Mel Gibson is quite good in the role and look forward to checking out the sequels. **3.75/5**"
9663,Starman,10.0,"Look who directed it... and that raises a lot of questions doesn't it? I mean it's espically good and then you see it's john Carpenter doing a... a love story and a very moving and beautiful love story.

I guess the draft Carpenter got was extremely political... and he took all the politics out and focused on the love story, that was a great call, it was a great call in the 80s and it is great advice for today.

And it's good with Bridges doing a stellar job, and he really didn't learn how to act until the 90s.

I totally forgot about it, and then my wife and I saw it, hadn't seen it since the 80s and forgot how amazing it was. It stands the test of time, it's moving, it's beautiful, and it entertains... you can't ask for more."
9671,Crocodile Dundee,7.0,Loose plot but Paul Hogan shines as Dundee and it's just an all around feel-good film that one can't help but put a smile on your face. Seen this a few times over the years but still holds up. **3.75/5**
9675,Sideways,9.0,"_""If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am NOT drinking any fucking Merlot""_

As I get older, I have realized that this movie is written really well. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church have a hilarious chemistry and I can't help but agree with Miles a few times. I wish I loved wine like Miles does, but I do love hearing him describe each one with a passion."
9678,Little Nicky,7.0,"I don't like American Comedies, and I especially don't like Adam Sandler, but for whatever reason, I love _Little Nicky_. Maybe it's A) because I was big into the heavy-metal-heavy Satanic themes when I first saw it at a mere 7 years old, or maybe it's B) because of how young and therefore unrefined my taste was I was when I first saw it, or maybe C) it's just... Actually good?

Almost certainly a combination of A and B.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
9678,Little Nicky,6.0,Different kind of role for Adam Sandler. He played it to perfection. He is the devil's son who doesn't even want him. His mother is an angel in heaven.
9679,Gone in Sixty Seconds,7.0,"Needed non-stop action. Too much talk, too long a run time.

<em>'Gone in Sixty Seconds'</em> does produce some fun action, but I personally felt an extra notch of thrill was needed with this; especially as it lasts for 118 minutes. Some parts are very ploddy, a shortened run time would've worked wonders.

Nicolas Cage is amusing in this, his character Memphis is actually quite goofy. The cast around him are pretty good, with a whole host of familiar names/faces. Angelina Jolie appears as Sway, with Giovanni Ribisi (Kip) and Vinnie Jones (Sphinx) in there too. Christopher Eccleston, meanwhile, makes for a decent bad guy.

Good fun, could've been far more entertaining though."
9679,Gone in Sixty Seconds,9.0,"**Ocean’s Eleven vibes with an endearing ensemble cast and cars instead of casinos.**

Gone in 60 Seconds is fun. Plain and simple. This entertaining, high-energy action romp is fueled by Nic Cage in his prime, gorgeous cars, an exceptional cast, and an unencumbered spirit that embraces the cheese. Gone in 60 Seconds immerses its viewers in a world of moral thieves with deep bonds and a strong code. As the movie progresses, discovering more about each character raises the stakes as the audience fears what could happen to these endearing bandits. Even though the plot has plenty of cheese, it’s balanced by the excellent execution and commitment of the cast. Peak Nic Cage makes the whole film sublime and delightful."
9679,Gone in Sixty Seconds,8.0,"Before there was fast the furious, there was gone in 60 seconds. Stealing cars in less the 60 seconds with Anglina Jolie by his side."
9681,Casanova,4.0,Childish in concepts and a little bit ideological. I like the costumes and atmosphere.
9689,Hollywood Ending,7.0,"Classical Woody Allen movie, script and performance. Funny at times, but not one of the best ones."
9691,Assassins,4.0,"A not great movie, but one that it's hard to pinpoint exact ways in which it could easily have been improved. A Stallone/Banderas as cat and mouse assassins sounds promising, but in reality this technoir thriller is... Actually kind of boring. Seems like it needs a ground-up re-working to get a story up to the concept of that team, which sounds exhausting.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
9693,Children of Men,6.0,"A strong premise and great cast prompted my interest, but the movie falls short of its promise. Clive Owens gives a great performance and a few of the scenes are remarkably memorable and resonant. However, there are very long stretches where the movie simply stagnates and the plot drifts away, especially towards the end. Overall, it's rather melancholy and despite the ""action"" scenes, not especially thrilling. If you like sci-fi movies set in dystopian futures, or are a big Clive Owen fan, you may still find it worth watching despite its flaws.

An aside: One of the ""extras"" on the DVD has some heavily accented academic trilling at length about the movie's philosophical meaning. It's entertainingly over-the-top and almost unintelligible: jargon piled into a Dagwood sandwich of contradictory abstractions. Anyway, if you don't watch too much of it, its good for a laugh."
9693,Children of Men,10.0,"Cuaron's masterpiece so far (including Gravity, which was gravely miscast). This film is: a) easily the best film of the decade of the 2000's; b) the finest dystopia film since 'A Clockwork Orange' and probably the best sci-fi since '2001: A Space Odyssey'; and c) all the evidence you need that Clive Owen should have been selected as James Bond in place of Daniel Craig. Heartily recommended to anyone interested in how great both science fiction and cinema can possibly be. You may be depressed with the state of both the world and mankind, after watching it, but you won't be disappointed in the possibilities of cinema."
9693,Children of Men,7.0,"One of the bleakest, most magnificently crafted films of all time. The dialogue is one-of-a-kind in actually capturing realism."
9694,One Missed Call,8.0,"One of the more emotionally driven of the J-horror genre, One Missed Call is a well done film with some haunting images, which is a staple with these of course, and although I probably prefer The Grudge, still found this one engaging thanks to some fine performances, mainly Ko Shibasaki and Shin'ichi Tsutsumi. **3.75/5**"
9705,Swordfish,8.0,"One of my all-time favorite guilty pleasures has it all with a convoluted plot, insane Bay-like explosions, that orange-tinge the early aughts were known for (also see Gone in 60 Seconds) and John Travolta sporting a soul-patch. Saw this one in theaters back in 2001 and like to put it on very couple of years when I feel like relaxing. **4.0/5**"
9717,Shoot to Kill,10.0,"""Shoot to Kill"" makes extremely good use of some absolutely breathtaking outdoor locations. It is also a very well paced and totally engaging film throughout and it features an admittedly heart stopping stunt that will literally take your breath away when Knox falls from a rope suspended over a picturesque and deadly gorge after he has been struck by the trolley used to transport people  across the head spinning and nausea-inducing gulf. There are also a wide range of wilderness survival tips and tracking techniques employed which help to place you in Poitier's predicament and it leaves you feeling as lost as he so obviously is when these necessary techniques come into play. It also teaches us the valuable lesson that if we were ever stranded in the unforgiving wilderness we would be incredibly lucky to survive for five seconds."
9722,Bewitched,6.0,Not a bad movie. The movie would've sucked if it weren't for Will Ferrell. He made the movie funny and decent.
9725,Friday the 13th Part 2,6.0,"_Friday the 13th_ creators couldn't have known what they were about to unleash in the now-infamous Jason Voorhees, and even though _Part 2_ is certainly not the strongest example of the character, it was the first time we got to really see him do his thing, and that's huge.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9725,Friday the 13th Part 2,8.0,"Since I already watched the first film last month, decided in celebration of the day, re-watched Part 2 and still highly entertaining though pretty tame by today's standards. Thought the cast was also a bit better than the first. Still has scenes that make little sense (how exactly did Jason find Alice?) but was fun nevertheless. **3.75/5**"
9727,End Game,0.5,"An extremely implausible story, where nobody but his bodyguard and a reporter seem to be interested in the killing of the US President. Not even after the two have been violently attacked in the middle of the city, together with a police patrol car, does anyone show any interest in their story.
The decision to take it directly to DVD was probably very wise, as the film critics would have killed it."
9728,Friday the 13th Part III,5.0,"Still to this day, the entry with the creepiest looking Jason.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
9728,Friday the 13th Part III,6.0,"Decided to get in one more Friday the 13th movie and this one reminded me why it's not high on my list in the series, though I liked portions of it, just nothing involving Shelly and watching it in 2D, the shots made for 3D are pretty annoying. I will say, I did like the lead actress and I'm a fan of the hockey mask Jason. **3.0/5**"
9730,Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter,6.0,"Doesn't divert much from the formula of the first three films, but does add two new elements which I actually enjoyed. I am curious though, when they made this one, did they **actually** think that this was going to be the final chapter, or where they fully aware they were gonna keep beating that horse for decades to come?

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9730,Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter,7.0,"Liked this one a bit more than the last time I saw it, a bit slow at times but, at least compared with Part III, better characters, but has some good and gnarly kills (one in particular when Jason comes out of the water). The biggest knock is the bad editing (one scene has Jason killing Crispin Glover in the kitchen and later the girl Glover slept with in the bedroom before a shot back in the kitchen) and poor continuity (the appearance of the family's dog was most noticeable). However, still found this entry entertaining enough. **3.25/5**"
9731,Friday the 13th: A New Beginning,7.0,"Shares ground with the original _Friday the 13th_ as the only two movies in this 12 film long franchise that play the killer as a mystery. A lot of people don't like that, but just personally, they both work a hundred percent for me.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
9732,The Lion King II: Simba's Pride,4.0,"If the first is Hamlet with lions then this one is Romeo & Juliet with lions. And if the first is a great kids' movie then this one is a passable kids' movie.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
9737,Bad Boys,5.0,"Fans of a pre-_Terminator_ Bay are gonna love it, and I can see where it succeeds, but personally _Bad Boys_ makes me kinda uncomfortable.

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._"
9737,Bad Boys,10.0,"Really funny, and action packed. One of my favorite movies of all time."
9738,Fantastic Four,10.0,"I personally find the Storyverse Fantastic Four films underrated for a lot of reasons. One good reason is Michael Chiklis' performance as Ben Grimm/The Thing. He did such a great job as the Thing and is seen by many as the best character. The acting, effects, plot and production values are pretty good. After the Fant4stic film, I feel like people should give this film and Rise of the Silver Surfer another chance."
9739,Demolition Man,6.0,"_Demolition Man_ may not exactly be the perfect movie, but the core idea behind the plot is something I've never ever seen done before or since. It's pretty mindless and fairly hammy, but it's fun and enough of an experience to get me across the finish line, no worse for the experience.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9740,Hannibal,6.0,"Certainly the weakest of the Anthony Hopkins _Hannibal_ movies. Having read the books before I watched the movies, that actually does sort of track, as the first two books were better than the third. Even so, I actually think _Hannibal_ does the worst job of adapting the source material too. Looks pretty good and there's quite the cast list (although I don't think many of them are exactly giving career-defining performances here), Julianne Moore is fine as Clarice Starling (although not as good as Jodie Foster), and the story isn't **bad**, but if I'm being honest, I typically give this one a skip whenever I'm revisiting the Lecter mythos. 

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9741,Unbreakable,6.0,"Not The Shamhammer's best, but certainly of the era when he was still making ""good"".

Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go."
9753,Three,3.0,"We watched this because we had just seen a crappy movie with Billy Zane in it. _Survival Island_ was the worse of the two.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
9766,Gridiron Gang,7.0,Great movie. Love football movies. This one keeps you interested. Too bad they can't win it all though.
9767,The Break-Up,7.0,"**HA HA HA**

I remember watching this when it first came out on DVD. At the time, I thought the movie was just okay. However, after gaining some life experience and spending time in long-term relationships, I appreciate it much more now. If we strip away the comedy, this film teaches us about self-awareness and the importance of communication, which definitely earns it some points.

Both actors did a great job in their roles, and as a fan of both, I was impressed by their performances. If you feel like you've watched every movie under the sun and you haven't seen this one yet, definitely give it a go."
9771,Major League: Back to the Minors,5.0,"I usually do all or nothing here, either it's good or it isn't. And, Major League II lost me as a kid when they added Epps and tried to tell us it was Snipes. Sorry, Epps, you failed the Pepsi challenge there.

But this one, well Corbin Benson is still here, but so is Scott Bakula and Walton Goggins and they both do a really great job on an otherwise stinker of a film.

So the cast is pretty solid. The acting is well done, and they aren't trying to sneak in new actors to play old favorites... the problem is the execution is God awful."
9772,Air Force One,8.0,"It’s a quite nice action flick. Some people on Rotten Tomatoes and other sites have been moaning that it was too much American patriotism. Well, that’s a load of bullshit! Sure it was very American but given the name and the cast, what the hell did these morons expect? If one cannot enjoy a good American action movie because of some patriotism in it, well then do not watch them! Incidentally there are some countries in Europe, no names mentioned cough cough, that could do with some more patriotism in the first place. Anyway, for us it was two enjoyable hours and hey, it's Harrison Ford after all! It is a decent enough transfer to Blu-ray although the choice of sound codecs is a bit unusual in that it has a Linear PCM 5.1 English track on it."
9772,Air Force One,7.0,"**Harrison Ford for President!**

Is this a typical action flick with the only significant differentiation being the hero's name is led by the word President? Yes indeed. But with the great Harrison Ford playing the hero and the always brilliant Gary Oldman as the antagonist, this impressive cast raises this movie from an action rehash to a classic. If you love 80s/90s action, then Air Force One is for you."
9772,Air Force One,6.0,"Ok, this is a pretty ridiculous movie, but aren't all action movies? It's Harrison Ford doing what Harrison Ford does but in the confines of a plane in midair against a bunch of gun-toting terrorists. So just switch off your brain and enjoy."
9772,Air Force One,6.0,"**_When the President’s plane is seized by Communist radicals_**

After a Russian terrorist (Gary Oldman) hijacks Air Force One with his cronies, the President (Harrison Ford) is intent on saving his wife & daughter and the other hostages (e.g. William H. Macy). Glenn Close plays the Vice President while Dean Stockwell is on hand as the Defense Secretary. 

“Air Force One” (1997) is a political suspense/thriller that combines “Under Siege” (1992) with “Executive Decision” (1996). While I prefer those two, this one’s in the same league.  

The Russian prison sequences were shot at Mansfield Reformatory, Ohio, which is where “The Shawshank Redemption” was shot. 

The movie runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland (Presidential palace, Kazakhstan), Rickenbacker Airport, Columbus (Ramstein AFB in Germany), Mansfield Reformatory and Los Angeles International Airport (Moscow airport scenes).

GRADE: B-"
9788,Accepted,8.0,"I connected more with the concept a lot. Though the movie is a dramatization (as films are) and therefore it is cliché-laden, colorful and hyperbolic. But it explores an idea.

We are raised to follow certain paths, categorized and rejected if we are different and take different paths. What if a place of higher education existed where that wasn't the case?

This film explores that idea. A place of informal education and personal growth."
9788,Accepted,7.0,"A legendary movie for a hangover-day, but one that I will never begrudge others for disliking. This is really not my usual sort of movie, but for whatever reason, _Accepted_ somehow totally works for me?

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"
9788,Accepted,9.0,"**Accepted is an insane ridiculous and charming comedy and pure dumb escapism.**

Accepted thrives in its absolute ludicrous premise - college hopefuls create a fake college because they don't want their parents to know they didn't get accepted anywhere else. Everything about this movie is ridiculous, wacky, and insane, and it's so much fun! The cast boasts two young up-and-coming stars, Jonah Hill and Blake Lively, before their careers exploded into mega-stardom. Justin Long's Bartleby Gaines grows as the leader of this ragtag group of rejects, eventually gaining the attention of the popular girl that hardly noticed him before. At its core, Accepted is about outcasts finding their tribe and embracing their entertaining quirks. The crazy characters always constantly entertain, and the laughs never stop. No one should ever reject Accepted."
9788,Accepted,8.0,Cool concept for a movie. It would be sweet if we could pull this off for real. Epic times.
9792,The Hills Have Eyes,8.0,"One of the best horror remakes to come out in this most recent trend. Rather than ignoring its source material, or taking the other extreme of drearily rehashing it scene for scene, Aja and Levasseur's _The Hills Have Eyes_ simply expands and improves upon the original.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
9793,The Hills Have Eyes 2,6.0,"Better than the other _Hills Have Eyes 2_ but not as good as the second _Hills Have Eyes_... Man, movie title marketing is confusing... My roommate loves this one a lot because she has a hard on for military horror, and while I don't love it, I'm still happy to give it a regular re-watch. 

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9798,Enemy of the State,8.0,I love a good conspiracy movie. Especially when it's a well thought out one. This movie was well thought out and had the perfect actors to do it.
9799,The Fast and the Furious,10.0,"I can’t call this film a legend. The film, which gave a big push in such a concept as street racing and tuning cars. He raised interest in illegal races on the night streets, gave life to such a renowned game like Need for Speed: Underground, which in turn gained countless fans. And maybe the storyline is really simple and without frills, but its implementation is worthy of deep respect."
9799,The Fast and the Furious,7.0,"Point Break with cars! Sure it is a little cheesy but in the best way. Fun cast and fun premise. Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, and Brewster deliver a great movie.

**Once again, Point Break with cars. Do you need more?**"
9799,The Fast and the Furious,6.0,"To be honest, the thin plot doesn't really matter here. This is just a good excuse for some fit people who look great to race souped-up production cars at break-neck speed around Los Angeles. Eye-candy Paul Walker (""Brian"") and hardened ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel) look like they are truly pumped up for their roles and given neither have much by the way of dialogue to remember, they just get on with it. The soundtrack is irritating but the production and stunt work match the high octane pace of the film and I quite enjoyed it."
9799,The Fast and the Furious,5.0,"Wait, what?  There is a heck of a lot left hanging here.  Almost feels like they started filming without a finished screen play and then stopped when the pages ran out, threw in a race at the end, and then left it there.

The Truck jacking story line had no real resolution.  One bad heist and it sort of ended there.  The racing thing had only a minor resolution....

... and then there were no real repercussions for anyone's actions and that is where the movie ends.  Only one arc was finished and that is it.

And so far, no, three movies in and they never really wrapped anything up."
9800,Philadelphia,7.0,"Yet another of those movies I watched close to when it came out umpteen years ago, and only recently watched again.

For entertainment value, it hasn’t aged particularly well for me. I am not sure I can even describe why, except that it seemed to lack energy. There are a lot of good small moments, but its big moments struggle to live up to their potential. The courtroom scenes slow the story down in places, and the climactic scene that decided the case wasn’t convincing to me. 

Still, this was an important movie addressing the AIDS when it came out, and the two low lead actors, even though they both give an understated performance, carry the film quite nicely."
9800,Philadelphia,8.0,Compelling performances by both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. And to think I almost didn't watch this because the poster doesn't look like Hanks...
9800,Philadelphia,8.0,"Very good. I did think I'd enjoy <em>'Philadelphia'</em> much more though, solely based on who appears on the poster.

The performances of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are impressive enough, though I'd say they have done greater in other productions. The story they portray here is a sizeable one and it is well told, it certainly makes you feel uncomfortable in parts and saddened in many others.

I do feel like the pacing could've been better, a shorter run time perhaps would've helped. Overall, if I'm honest, my interest in this wasn't all that strong throughout, I couldn't shake the feeling of wanting something more from it. I can still acknowledge it's objective quality, of course."
9801,Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,6.0,"""_You think you've found the right man, but there's so much wrong with him, and then he finds there's so much wrong with you, and then it all just falls apart._""

It feels like an extension of the first movie more than a prequel. I mean that as in it is very similar, contuing from where we left off and is still pretty funny. Lesson for me here is that overthinking is a bitch."
9801,Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,6.0,"<em>'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason'</em> is a totally pointless sequel. There isn't really anything substantial that happens in this, it basically goes in one big circle before finishing how it started; aside from one minute-long detail. Admittedly, it does manage to avoid being bad.

Renée Zellweger remains a plus, as do Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. With that said, this film adds nothing new to their characters, they are just replicas of themselves from the 2001 original. The film (as before) does have a charm to it, which saves it from a lower rating... too generous?"
9802,The Rock,6.0,"The two lead characters' impact on the events of the move are pretty negligible, everyone and everything in it is laughably stupid, and you can see here begin to blossom the stereotypes that Michael Bay would go on you ruin everything he ever touched with, but I still kind of like _The Rock_. Maybe it's just in comparison to all of Bay's other films, or maybe it's because it's the only one of his works I saw when I was still single-digit aged, but I do enjoy it. I'm not willing to defend it, just to re-watch it once a decade or so. 

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go. _"
9820,The Parent Trap,7.0,"Really good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

Having recently watched the original, this movie does a rather nice job of following it beat for beat.  Now, it's not the same movie, but it follows the same format, with modernization and punch-ups throughout the movie.  

As someone who complains about deviation from the source material, I approve the changes here.  Sadly, they kept the twins carrying the movie, which means Lindsay Lohan was doing double work, but you could hardly tell.  The green screen and clone work in this is actually really well done for late 1990's.

The most important aspect is that the movie retained its charm in re-uniting a lost / separated family."
9820,The Parent Trap,8.0,"Entertaining and sweet. Just as good as the 1961 original, which probably edges this ever so slightly but they are both terrific films.

1998's <em>'The Parent Trap'</em> features Lindsay Lohan in the dual role, she is excellent as Hallie and Annie - Hayley Mills from '61 would be my pick as the sisters, but again it's a tremendous piece of casting.

It's also a tight call between the parents, with Dennis Quaid (Nick) and Natasha Richardson (Liz) in those roles here - they have believable chemistry, which is key. Elsewhere in this '98 remake, Elaine Hendrix (Meredith) and Lisa Ann Walter (Chessy) are good.

The camera work et al. is impressive. Though, just like the first film, the run time could probably have been shorter. Not that that's a big negative, as this film is very much enjoyable to watch. Recommended."
9822,Mighty Joe Young,7.0,"It's basically <em>'King Kong'</em>, let's be honest.

In fairness, though, <em>'Mighty Joe Young'</em> does do its own thing and it's a film I did feel entertained by. Bill Paxton (Gregg) and Charlize Theron (Jill) are two of the big reasons, they are both enjoyable in this. The effects/animatronics for the gorilla are also impressive, even when Joe is shown via people in costume (incl. Verne Troyer!) he looks decent. They did a fine job in that regard.

The premise isn't anything revolutionary, but there is certainly a fair amount of heart in there. I would've liked it more without the typical happy ending, admittedly. The music and cinematography is solid. The villains, meanwhile, are probably this production's weakest area, I never really became interested in them or their story.

Good film, all in all."
9824,Mystery Men,5.0,Last saw Mystery Men probably 1999/2000 depending on when the DVD came out. I didn't think much of it then and my opinion 20+ years later really hasn't changed. Now the movie has its moments I guess and I did chuckle a few times but otherwise I found it pretty dull in spite of the spectacle finale (topped off with late 90s effects). Strange because it has a solid and talented cast. **2.5/5**
9825,Lake Placid,5.0,"Not bad for a giant-gator Creature Feature, but Goddamn listening the dialogue in the first act is aggravating as sin.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
9825,Lake Placid,7.0,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

I like a crocodile movie, they don't even have to be giant-sized, they make really good ""monsters"", and the reality of their danger sits in the back of your head.

The cast was great in this, though Bridget Fonda screams a lot, and I can't say it's very endearing.

They do sort of a ""unlikely crew"" trope with this, but most of the movie is dedicated to trying to find the thing in one capacity or the other.

I just feel they did a good job on everything all round, and while it's not phenomenal, part of me REALLY wants a re-make of this one."
9825,Lake Placid,7.0,"It's the humour garnished all over Lake Placid that makes it more than an entertaining watch about crocodile terror. You know it's a spoof but you know there's danger out there too that the characters are going to fall into. Add to that the on-the-point performances and dialogue delivery by Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, and Brendan Gleeson and the overall atmosphere of the film, and you have a terrific film to enjoy with friends and family. This is some great popcorn entertainment. **Grade B**."
9825,Lake Placid,5.0,"Lake Placid, a 1999 monster horror movie about killer crocs, no Batman. And yuhhhh Lone Starr is here from Spaceballs! First off is why they make Kelly out to be some ""yankee girl"" or whatever, seems so forced. And second did Hector just say the female office had a nice pair of boobs?? I feel like that's dangerous game he's playing she has handcuffs and a gun! 

Hell yeah! Crocodile vs. Bear! And Betty White is great in this, I love her RIP. The cinematography is a little below average I think. And overall the movie is average, I like that they picked crocodile as the monster, it's usually sharks or snakes or something not real. And the story isn't boring or overused or anything."
9825,Lake Placid,7.0,"**Lake Placid swam so Sharknado could fly!**

Billing Lake Placid as a horror movie could not be more misleading. This movie is a goofy creature feature with hardly a scary moment. Instead, all the tension and fear are played up for hilarity and entertainment. I remember watching this as a young kid and laughing the entire time. Lake Placid is a delightful action comedy with a solid cast for being such a low-budget film. Lake Placid is an excellent entry in a long line of stupid creature films that are pure enjoyment if you disconnect your brain, grab some popcorn, and get ready to have fun. If you enjoy a ridiculous shark movie, you will love Lake Placid."
9825,Lake Placid,8.0,Love this movie. This is the only movie I ever seen with some gigantic alligators. How fast they can kill someone in this movie is insane.
9826,The Phantom,7.0,"Campy fun of a time. Seen this a few times over the years and while he does look goofy in the purple outfit, Billy Zane is good in the role and a shame this didn't get a follow-up. A bit surprising there hasn't been some sort of series adaptation of the material. **3.25/5**"
9829,United 93,,"A remarkable film that I didn't want to watch but felt compelled to and felt numb at the very end.
Stunningly stark in its portrayal of the events of that day, Paul Greengrass produced a film that one can never forget."
9829,United 93,7.0,"**United 93 is not an easy film to watch, but it honors the unprecedented circumstances of United 93 on September 11.**

United 93 is the sobering story of the bravery of the hostages that fought to retake United 93 on September 11, 2001. Paul Greengrass masterfully captured the chaos and panic of September 11 as the military, government, FAA, and airlines all scrambled to respond to the terrorist crisis. The movie takes a few minutes before the frenzy is unleashed, but once it does, the tension and heart-pounding don’t stop until the credits roll. This film is not a feel-good or heartwarming movie because it perfectly depicts the terror the passenger experienced and the power of their courage in such extraordinary circumstances. It’s significant to see, understand, and experience that day through the perspectives of so many trying to protect the lives of those in danger."
9830,Haven,6.0,"Decent enough interconnected ensemble drama. Doesn't flow as well compared with others within this subgenre (i.e. Traffic) but performances were good, especially liked (of course) Bill Paxton (RIP) and Zoe Saldana.  **3.0/5**"
9836,Happy Feet,6.0,It was at least a different kind of a movie. They do look cute. They looked pretty funny dancing.
9841,Rest Stop,1.0,"So I am going to give _Rest Stop_ a rating of half a star, because it's fucking terrible, but I must admit, I did have at least a little fun talking shit about the movie with some mates.

Ridiculous.

Final rating:½ - So bad it’s offensive."
9841,Rest Stop,4.0,"Straight-to-video had a simple but solid premise going in but throwing in a clear supernatural element (i.e. a phantom, immortal driver and vivid, interactive hallucinations) really turned me off. I will say Jaimie Alexander (in what looks like only her second feature film) wasn't bad. Watchable I guess but ultimately doesn't work. **2.25/5**"
9843,Big Nothing,4.0,"If you make a film called _Big Nothing_ you really have to offer something interesting, otherwise you're just opening up yourself to that really easy joke. For Simon Pegg completionists only.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
9845,Dance with the Devil,8.0,Pretty crazy and messed up romance-thriller featuring great performances from Rose Perez and Javier Bardem. Slows down a tad in the third act before ratcheting up again for the finale. Some really uncomfortable scenes but still a highly engaging film. This was the 130-minute uncut version. **4.0/5**
9870,Forgetting Sarah Marshall,7.0,"This was a refreshing surprise. Quite hilarious at some points, not so funny in others but still refreshing and the cast does a good job."
9873,F/X,7.0,"Seen this one a few times over the years, not great and Bryan Brown is a bit limited with the dramatic stuff but still an all around entertaining suspense-thriller. **3.5/5**"
9874,Cobra,5.0,"It's hard to find a single aspect of _Cobra _that hadn't been done before, or hasn't been done better since. It's hoakey and way too self-serious given the content. But if you're hankering for some of that Sly action of yore, you shouldn't go past _Cobra_... Unless its for any number of the nearly-identical-but-better movies he did in the same era.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
9874,Cobra,7.0,"Short and sweet.

<em>'Cobra'</em> is a straightforward, by the numbers action film with Sylvester Stallone. It doesn't really do much to drift you away from the obvious, but the action itself is entertaining and some of the deaths are quite cool to watch. The songs are passable, if not entirely well chosen.

Stallone, as you'd likely expect, is the only performer worth noting. He does his usual stuff and it comes across strong enough, one thing I didn't like about his character is his speech - the dialogue is kinda poor, they attempt to make Cobra a smooth, cool badass but it doesn't really work in that way.

I'd almost considering this a disappointing film, but the watchable action and Stallone himself carry this over the line for a good film in my opinion."
9874,Cobra,10.0,"My mother loved this film back when I was a kid, actually took me to see it three times in the theater... when I was about 6.

As a kid, it was another fun action movie with a lot of fun violence and just scary enough where I could boast about it at school. And, as an adult it's a fun action movie with a lot of fun violence and a plot that doesn't completely make sense, but who cares because the point is fun.

It's one of those movies that you don't expect a lot going into and you are rewarded with, well, mindless popcorn munching action that is delivered in a way that only the 80s could do.

So what's not to like?"
9877,Urban Legend,4.0,"One of many lame slashers that sprouted in the late 90s thanks to the mega success of 'Scream'. Good cast utterly wasted with stilted dialogue and a nonsensical story, a half-assed motive and tame kills that weren't all that memorable."
9880,The Princess Diaries,7.0,"It goes on for a bit too long, but <em>'The Princess Diaries'</em> is just about a good film.

Anne Hathaway (Mia) is the star no doubt, she's the only character I'll likely remember from this 2001 production. Julie Andrews (Clarisse) is decent too, while Héctor Elizondo (Joe) is extremely likeable in his role. There's also a (incredibly) small appearance from <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> alum Karl Makinen.

I found the plot a little tedious to watch in parts, not helped by a few cringey gags. I also, in live-action/non-fantasy films, always find it difficult to believe in fictional places - in this case ""Genovia"". It's a small gripe of mine. Anyway, I do of course appreciate and rate the overall message of the film.

Overall, when all is said and done, I did narrowly enjoy watching this. The main reason being Hathaway, but also the moral of the story."
9884,Collateral Damage,7.0,"Okay action-thriller that has some decent action and overall was entertaining. However, this is one where I think Schwarzenegger was the wrong choice to lead as someone like Bruce Willis (circa 2002 mind you) would've worked better. Still, has its moments. **3.25/5**"
9885,Wolf Creek,9.0,"Just when you thought it was safe to go hiking in the bushes again...along comes Mick Taylor. Kristy, Ben and Liz are three pals in their twenties who set out to hike through the scenic Wolf Creek National Park in the Australian Outback. The trouble begins when they get back only to find that their car won't start. The trio think they have a way out when they run into a local bushman named Mick Taylor. Wait until you get a load of what Mick has in store for them. Their troubles have just begun."
9886,Johnny Mnemonic,4.0,"Decent watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend past a Bad Movie Night.

What a trip in the way back machine to see the inspiration for ""The Matrix"", maybe more of an homage to ""Lawnmover Man"", but very clearly they didn't have the capability to what they actually wanted to do with the movie.

The best things are clearly Dina Meyer (""Starship Troopers"": Dizzy) and the ""Hot Garotte"" lazer whip thing, why haven't more movies used that?

Clearly Keanu Reeves did his best to try to hold this thing together, but the writing isn't that great, despite have a pretty good story and world to it.  It's really dated, but it's good enough I would actually like to see a reboot of this.

There isn't a lot to say: the production and execution fell short and it's just not worth going back to watch this one."
9895,Man of the Year,7.0,"""Man of the Year"" starring Robin Williams is a comedy film about a talk show host who decides to run for president, highlighting how the political spectrum isn't always strictly left or right. Williams shines in his role, blending comedy with a touch of political savvy that showcases his acting prowess throughout the movie. He skillfully portrays the complexities of a politician, all while adding his trademark humor to the mix.

The film is paced well, smoothly navigating through the engaging storyline that touches on election fraud and potential tampering. ""Man of the Year"" delivers a strong message about the need to break free from the constraints of traditional political divides and think outside the box. With its clever plot and Williams' stellar performance, this movie is a must-watch that I highly recommend to everyone."
9896,Rat Race,5.0,"Given the ensemble talent involved, and the director, this should've been so much better. I did manage to laugh a few times here and there but otherwise never quite worked. **2.75/5**"
9896,Rat Race,6.0,"Very funny and interesting. There waiting for grand dad to kick the bucket. Before he dies he sets up a quest for them to have a race. He gives them clues and they have to be the first person to figure it out and get to him first. Whoever is the first on wins his estate. It's a race, it's a race!"
9909,Dangerous Minds,7.0,"So cheesy, but still fairly good mind you.

I did find myself cringing a decent amount throughout <em>'Dangerous Minds'</em> though, not necessarily in a negative way but just due to some rather sickly scenes. I found Michelle Pfeiffer's performance to be, for the most part, pleasant, though there are a few scenes where she overacts ever so slightly - in my opinion, of course.

Away from Pfeiffer, there isn't much to shout about. George Dzundza (Hal) has a few moments, as do the likes of Renoly Santiago, Bruklin Harris and Wade Dominguez. The lead is the only one who keeps things interesting, though.

The plot is fine, as is everything else really. They use ""Gangsta's Paradise"" (at least?) three times which is undoubtedly, absolutely three times too little - what a banger of a song that is from Coolio and L.V."
9918,Glory Road,7.0,"**Glory Road shares the incredible true story of the determination and bravery of Texas Western's 1966 basketball team, but the script falls short of capturing its full potential.**

Glory Road retells the inspiring story of 1966's first all-African American starting line-up in college basketball. The adversity these young men overcame and the courage to rise above the hatred and prejudice was genuinely inspiring. The cast, led by Josh Lucas, did a great job embodying the boldness and grit of each man. Unfortunately, the screenplay was fairly derivative and formulaic, even with a compelling true story. The movie is enjoyable but feels overdone and unoriginal, which takes away from the power of the story. Glory Road is not a bad movie by any means, but it could have been much better."
9919,How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,9.0,"**I would be bold enough to say if you don’t like this film, it’s because you hate joy… that’s dramatic, but still, it’s a good movie.**

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is the gold standard of RomComs. Charming leads, quirky characters, a ridiculous but fun premise, drama, character growth and development, and romance all crammed into a wonderful film that is worth watching again and again. McConaughey and Hudson’s chemistry elevates this 2003 RomCom from typical to delightful and was so great they reunited for a second film (Fools Gold. Not great, but still.) While its 2003 release slightly dates it, and the movie’s concept is a little more complicated than the average RomCom, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is exceptionally satisfying due to its stellar cast, hilarious antics, and awkwardly entertaining dating commentary."
9919,How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,10.0,"Very clever thought out movie. So funny I can't help but like this movie. One is trying to make her fall in love in days, and the other one is trying to make him break up with her in 10 days."
9922,The Postman,4.0,"This movie fits firmly in the ""it's so bad it's good"" category.
It's so outrageous, that you just have to see how it's going to end up.

The dialogue/scripts are woeful... but they are delivered with such passion that it almost leaves you breathless.

At the end of the movie, I had no idea what I had just watched, but definitely felt that I had been entertained!
Go figure."
9923,Domino,4.0,"This is a movie I previously watched 15+ years ago, didn't like it then; still don't like it today. Tony Soctt's style, which leaned much more toward gritty oversaturation in his latter films, was a bit too much for me, as was the frenetic direction and editing which failed in keeping me entertained or caring for any of these characters, and this coming from someone who loves Keira Knightley. On the plus side, at least the video and audio still hold up, shame the rest of film, and its good cast, never came together. **2.0/5**"
9942,Major League,9.0,"**Major League proves anything can be fun and hilarious with the right collection of zany outlandish characters.**

Major League just makes me happy. It’s packed with quirky, eccentric characters, lots of ridiculous moments, sincere character development, and that iconic song, Wild Thing! This crazy team of misfit baseball players makes Major League as wonderful as it is. Tom Berenger’s weary veteran catcher balances a young Charlie Sheen and Wesley Snipes. Add in All-State Insurance’s own Dennis Haysbert as the volatile voodoo power hitter, Pedro Cerrano, and strong performances from Rene Russo, James Gammon, and Corbin Bernson, and Major League becomes one of the most iconic and hilarious sports movies of all time. Major League made me start to enjoy watching baseball at a young age and fills me with nostalgia and joy. Ok, I need to go watch it again right now."
9945,Vampires,6.0,"Never been a big fan of this movie, and of vampires in general, but seeing it again after many years, did kind of enjoy it primarily for James Woods and to some extent Thomas Ian Griffith's over-the-top performance (and Sheryl Lee is easy on the eyes for sure). Certainly not top tier John Carpenter and the editing was a mess, but still somewhat entertaining. **3.0/5**"
9946,End of Days,7.0,One of my favorite Arnold movies. A lot of crazy demonic people. Lots of action and a great storyline.
9947,Elektra,6.0,"Last watched this years ago and didn't think much of it then but seeing it again, did find it moderately entertaining if not cheap looking at times under journeyman director Rob Bowman who helmed more TV episodes than feature films. Still, Jennifer Garner is great and I guess some of the fight scenes were okay and a serviceable enough of a story, if not feeling slapped together. **2.75/5**"
9955,Blades of Glory,6.0,I really thought this movie would be horrible. It was actually a funny and entertaining movie. I swear Will Ferrell can make anything funny. He's one of my favorite actors.
9957,The Benchwarmers,,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

This is a surprisingly charming story with a positive message.

Sure, it's a ""dirt humor"" movie, but the cast works really well together, and it minimizes the amount of baseball in a baseball movie without removing too much.

While it does do a lot of things that are either too stupid or potentially offensive to be funny, it does even more that are legitimately funny or have a positive message to them.

Ultimately, if you like Rob Schneider, David Spade, or Jon Heder, then you'll probably like this, because you'll get a lot of them.

I'm not sure if I can recommend this as a good baseball movie because i'm not a fan of baseball, but it manages to be there without being overwhelming."
9963,Premonition,7.0,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

Sandra Bullock carries this mad tale of time shifting back and forth throughout a week in the highest stakes of her life.

Not only do you get an interesting time travel story delivered in a dramatic fashion, as opposed to the action comedies they normally are, but you get a deep conversation of the implied morality of knowing the future and the agency of acting upon that information.

Good writing takes this far, but Bullock's performance is the big benefit of this one."
9963,Premonition,5.0,"About the only thing this has going for it is Sandra Bullock, who performs decently, even while overacting..."
9964,Bad Taste,6.0,"So it begins...

Made on a shoestring budget, starring friends and shooting on the weekends, this is how NZ's blockbuster director Peter Jackson got his start.

Gross, silly, with terrible masks and effects, weird acting and bad overdubbing, this film is an utter classic in DIY splatter.  The sheer passion and ingenuity oozes from every frame.  Hasn't dated too well, but it still has serious charm, and I am pleased to have grown up watching it.

For fans of late night B films"
9969,Deck the Halls,7.0,"Stupid, whacky and bonkers... yet enjoyable. I found <em>'Deck the Halls'</em> fun.

Danny DeVito is the film's star, no question. If it wasn't for him I'd potentially be rating this lower, I admit. He gives an amusing performance, while the hearty stuff directly with him works. Matthew Broderick is a little forgettable here but still produces a good display. Kristin Chenoweth is probably the best of the rest, but it's all about DeVito in truth.

I mentioned the heart works with the aforementioned actor, but elsewhere it's a a bit hit-and-miss. The final scene, that Chenoweth plays a part in, is very iffy - could've went either way, I just about liked it though. The humour is good, as is the plot - as silly as it is. I also really enjoyed how they did the lights.

I got entertainment from this."
9969,Deck the Halls,3.0,"It's _a_ Christmas movie. It won't get annoying if you put it on in the background but it will if you sit down and try to play ultra close attention to it. It's _acceptable_. Entire movie is held up by Danny DeVito's acting.

Edit January 16th, 2025: Thinking back on this it really wasn't good at all. It has an incest joke and a cross-dressing joke and overall wasn't that entertaining, and I found myself wishing for the movie to end before it finished. As Christian Di Leo said on Letterboxd:

> What do you think Matthew Broderick feels worse about? Killing that mother and daughter in his 1987 drunk driving accident? Or starring in Deck The Halls?"
9972,Lock Up,6.0,"My roommate and I were on a Stallone kick recently, but we never got around to watching _Lock Up_ because we were looking for some hard (see: over-the-top) action, and this sounded more like a wistful drama. Eventually though, _Lock Up_ came due, and I... actually kind of loved it? It's about as cheesy I had feared, but I what never occurred to me is that that cheese would totally work. I mean, it's not exactly Shawshank we're working with here, but if I were putting together a list of all the good prison movies ever made, _Lock Up_ would be on it.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
9975,Curious George,10.0,"> George is gone, and it's your fault


Yeah... this is a masterpiece. Matthew O'Callaghan had not made many movies prior to this (aka he made 3 TV specials) but he came out with this masterpiece and absolutely killed it. All of the actors, writers, animators, the director, etc did so good on this film. The animation is so colorful and expressive like it's just so good. I kid you not this is the best film I've ever seen in my entire life. If you have Hulu, Peacock or the Disney+ and Hulu bundle, PLEASE check this out. It's extremely worth it."
9981,Kicking & Screaming,8.0,"I swear Will Ferrell can make any movie, and it would be hilarious. He's coaching a little kids soccer team. Him and Mike Ditka are pretty funny together."
9982,Chicken Little,7.0,"Harmless fun. <em>'Chicken Little'</em> isn't anything standout, but there is solid humour and a satisfactory premise to follow.

I like the references to pop culture, Zach Braff is enjoyable in the titular role and the run time is nice and short. It's forgettable, but I'm sure the core target audience will rate it. It does comes across as two separate plots, they are actually connected but it can feel like the opposite in a few moments.

There's not much else to note really. It'll divide opinion obviously, but I think it just about sneaks under the 'good' category in my books."
9986,Charlotte's Web,9.0,"This is a lovely film :) Julia Roberts is lovely as the eponymous character, Dakota Fanning is a delightful Fern, and Dominic Scott Kay is an adorable Wilbur- if you see the special features, he does come across as quite a shy little boy

Lovely film :) <3"
9988,Beerfest,5.0,"Not one of Broken Lizard's strongest entries, but perhaps classic viewing for those in the state that it's characters are: Drunk.

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._"
9988,Beerfest,8.0,This was a awesome movie. I love these guys just as good as they were in super troopers. I would definitely like to try this in real life myself sometime. It would be sweet.
