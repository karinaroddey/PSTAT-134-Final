10002,Really good British neo-noir featuring great performances from Bob Hoskins and the lovely Cathy Tyson who share some nice scenes together and a pretty melancholy ending. Michael Caine is great as a classy scumbag (seems like he played many of these roles in the 70s and 80s). This is the second time seeing this and still holds up. **4.0/5**,8.0
10002,"I had watched this movie many years ago, but not to remember much of it, so with the fairly positive ratings and Bob Hoskins, it felt like a safe bet. But there wasn’t as much humor as I thought I remembered, and the plot of a guy trying to “rescue” a hooker seems rather stereotypical and predictable in places. It didn’t do much for me and I barely stuck with it. I was so unimpressed that I decided not to watch another gangster movie featuring Hoskins and good ratings.",6.0
10003,"Good watch, would watch again, and can't confidently recommend.

This movie is definitely dated.  Val Kilmer was still riding on ""I was Batman"" and a bunch of Hollywood actors had decided to have a go at being the next action (/spy) guy, and I think it was to try to knock Tom Cruise out of his position (like that worked).

This international spy of mysterious origin, even with an entire backstory as a prelude in the beginning of the movie, just so happens to be targeting ""cold fusion"", so we get a sci-fi edge.

The person that happens to make the most plausible progress on cold fusion just happens to be a ""stunningly beautiful woman"", Elisabeth Shue, with a heart condition to top everything off.

The actual movie experience was good, I promise, but thinking back on things, it all sounds so ridiculous.  There is a lot of underlying romantic comedy at play here, and if I'm honest, I don't think they movie knew what it wanted to be: mob movie, sci-fi discovery, rom com, action / spy, political intrigue, catholic revolution, or orphan identity.

Most of the fun stuff is spy versus Russian mob or cute rom com stuff, but you could probably get a better experience for either in different movies.

It's a good time, but given all the options out there, you're probably better off looking for a more modern spy movie.",6.0

Kilmer's role almost feels like that of a super hero, with a childhood trauma that still haunts him. The beautiful and vulnerable Elizabeth Shue complements the confident Kilmer. The villains are fun to despise, and the action scenes feel more fun because everyone is freezing their butts off while the viewer is comfortable on their recliner. It makes me nostalgic for this near-millennium period of filmmaking, which for whatever reason also brings to mind films like Sabrina (call me crazy).",8.0
10003,"**One of the worst espionage films of all time, in my opinion.**

Anyone who saw the original series, from the 60s, with Sir Roger Moore in the lead role (he later took on the character of another charming secret agent, James Bond, who made him world-famous), will never forget it. It was arguably one of the best-made European series of that time, and was a huge success. I've never seen it all, although I'd like to, especially because I'm not that old. I saw some episodes released on TV channels dedicated to old programming, and I recognize that there is no way to compare the original product with this film, which is much inferior.

Technically, the film seeks to make everything that was most advanced available to the production, but it still doesn't give us a great visual spectacle. Any film in the 007 franchise from the Pierce Brosnan era (roughly the same time) can be much better, more visually stunning and better executed. From the sets to the editing, to the cinematography, costumes and special effects, the film never manages to be as incredible as it would need to be to enchant us. This does not mean that it is poorly executed or makes very glaring errors in this area! It's simply more of the same.

Val Kilmer is not a bad actor, but he is one of those actors who need to be very well directed to get where you want him to go. I've seen him in other films where he's simply impeccable, so I can't blame him entirely for being such a slob in this film. Personally, I think that the material he was given to work with was already bad and that the director, Phillip Noyce, was not able to help the actor as he needed. However, it is fair to mention that Kilmer was, even so, the most competent actor present in this film! Elizabeth Shue has nothing more to do than be the damsel in distress of the day and the hero's more than obvious romantic interest (the old misogynistic cliché of the woman as a reward trophy at the end of the feat), if only because that spend the entire film showing how needy she feels! It's degrading and sad! The actress is terrible and doesn't go beyond a mediocre effort. Even worse are the two villains, Rade Serbedzija and Valeriy Nikolaev. The first still shows some qualities as an actor and tries to do something convincing, but he is stuck with the oldest clichés about corrupt Russian oligarchs, and the second is just the brutal sidekick with narcissistic and sociopathic tics.

The film might not have sunk completely if it had at least had a script worthy of the name. Unfortunately, Noyce consented to direct one of the worst spy movie scripts I've ever seen. It starts by taking one of the most fanciful and idiotic myths in nuclear physics, which is cold fusion, something that any school teacher in the area will be able to explain very easily is impractical. Then, it invents an energy crisis in Russia! In one of the world's largest producers of oil and natural gas! It's something so absurd that you can't believe it, even considering that this crisis could be caused by a group of people with an interest in destabilizing the country.

The quality of the animation, the Phil Collins-led soundtrack (with a decent number from Tina Turner too) and the spirituality of the whole thing is breezy and enjoyable to watch. The young ""Koda"" reminded me frequently of a sort of ""Mowgli"" character. Friendly and playful but still staying on the right side of annoying.

A premise that was superbly executed by all involved in the first film. Part 2 bravely tried to advance the bogeyman story to another level, to one of possession, which in hindsight was a mistake.

10015,"***A more comedic version of “The Dirty Dozen,” but taking place in 1983 and starring Clint Eastwood***  

Clint Eastwood’s ""Heartbreak Ridge"" (1986) stars Eastwood as a tough, soon-to-retire Marine gunnery sergeant who conflicts with the brass and his former-wife (Marsha Mason) as he takes command of a spoiled recon squad. The platoon is eventually deployed to Grenada in late October, 1983, in order to prevent a communist takeover and rescue some med students.

Thirteen years after “The Dirty Dozen,” Eastwood recycles the plot and adds a lot of hip comedy. Although it’s not a great military flick like “Dozen” it has its points of entertainment, but you have to roll with the odd mixture of believable military training drama with heavy doses of amusement, mainly revolving around the cartoonish character of Cpl. Stitch Jones, played with fervor by Mario Van Peebles. If you can acclimate to this odd mixture, there’s a lot to enjoy here.

It helps that the movie hooks you in with the opening jail fight involving the hard-living Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway (Eastwood). His reunion with his ex-wife and their potentially developing relationship is another hook. Some parts are kinda meh, but there’s enough good here if you’re in the mood for a military training flick in the form of “The Dirty Dozen” meeting “Top Gun” (1987) mixed with an edgier version of Gomer Pyle.

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot at Camp Pendleton, Southern Cal, as well as Santa Clarita (café), San Clemente (bar), El Toro (airfield homecoming) and Vieques, Puerto Rico (Grenada).

GRADE: B-",6.0
10015,"Crusty Clint is still not to be messed with.

One of Clint Eastwood's most accessible 80s movies, Heartbreak Ridge sees the gruff actor on very fine form, this even though the ""war is hell"" core that fills out the last quarter via a rather silly gun toting rescue mission in Grenada does lack conviction. The film wins its stripes courtesy of James Carabatsos' razor witty script and the sub plot involving ex wife Aggie (Marsha Mason). For all its macho posturing and training routine shenanigans (you will wish we could have stayed at boot camp once Grenada arrives), at its heart is a very tender movie about a man who can't let the career go, and simultaneously the wife (ex) who simply lived hell each day as her man was off at war (Korea/Vietnam et al).

That said, it's the comedy that has made the film one of the most quoted film's of big Clint's career. Be it Eastwood himself tossing off witty put downs to his rag tag band of men, or the likes of Mario Van Peebles hilariously looking like some punk version of Michael Jackson, there's a lot of fun to be had in every other frame. There's even a guy here whose thighs are bigger than Sly Stallone! So yes there's many stereotypes here, none more so than Everett McGill's fresh out of school prig Major Powers, and for sure the ending is never in any doubt what so ever.

Led by ""Ballard"" (Natasha Henstridge) these cops, and their target, soon discover that their location has been compromised and pretty soon they are under siege from an army of zombies with an unique (and quite well depicted) means of entering and controlling the human body. Odd to see Jason Statham with hair, but otherwise I found this to be a pretty unremarkable drama that I can't think John Carpenter would look back on particularly fondly. Henstridge is competent, but her part is so generic and the dialogue - especially with her and a lacklustre Pam Grier is banal. It looks OK, and the pace once we start picks up too, but the whole thing is really derivative and this attempt to mix the horror and sci-fi genres is too dependent on some, admittedly decent, make up effects before an ending that left me wondering if a sequel were to be in the offing.

A ruthless (but comical) gang terrorizes a town in southern Arizona, forcing guys to drag race in order to ‘win’ their vehicles; that is, until a young man comes to town (Sheen), along with a mysterious black sportscar and driver. Randy Quaid is on hand as the Sheriff.

""The Wraith"" (1986) is like a meshing of the contemporaneous “Top Gun” with the campiness of “Lost Boys” (which came out the next year), just trade the pilot ace flying with drag racing and the vampires with a thug gang. The hammy approach mainly applies to Skank (David Sherrill), Gutterboy (Jamie Bozian) and tech-geek Rughead (Clint Howard) whereas Nick Cassavetes is more subdued about it as the lead bully, but still cartoonishly exaggerated. Nick, by the way, is the son of John Cassavetes & Gina Rowlands, which is odd since John was only 5’7” while Nick is 6’6”, but I guess it happens.

I’m not a fan of the hammy tone and think it would’ve worked better if done more seriously, like “Top Gun.” However, if you can roll with the goofiness, it’s entertaining on several fronts. For instance, the Arizona locations are spectacular, Sherilyn Fenn’s beauty is well captured and there’s a lot of thrilling vehicle mayhem.

Of all the teen comedies and brat packer pictures that flooded the decade, Mannequin appears to be the one that has no in between fan base, you either love it for what it is, or despise it and everything it stands for.

So how do you review something like that? I mean if you have seen it already and are reading this, you don’t need any guidance from me. Your minds are already made up, if you have not seen it and have any interest in the 1980s strand of such fare, then give it a go. It’s hardly an abomination, while for fans of Kim Cattrall and Andrew McCarthy it has to be worth a watch to see them try to cope with such under written lead characters.

It’s frothy and cheerful, but yes, devoid of substance, while one stereotype coupled with James Spader’s worst performance hardly help matters these days. Soundtracking is decent enough, led by power pop ballad Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now sung by Starship, while the costuming is garishly period.

One of the first films in the revolution of modern dance flicks, though I know I saw it too late. Nowadays there are many films are coming out since the younger generation showing very interest in the dance. I especially don't know how 'Step Up' made a successful franchise, but the sixth is on the way.

Honey is a main character's name played by Jessica Alba. A passionate dance, choreographer, when her dream coming to true that hits a roadblock for some reason followed by other issues. So now she has to come up with a solution to solve all the problems and that's the film tells how she overcomes them all at once.

A simple story, even the choreography was ordinary, but not a bad film. I anticipated Alba to give a show that not to forget for the decades. This is now obviously a decade old flick and disappointed with her character, especially with her dance moves. But young Alba in a sexy pose on the poster, no one can just ignore it from watching.

Overall, I enjoyed it. Since I'm watching it delayed, I should not compare it to the present scenario. Even though it has been only 13 years, in which all the fields rapidly advanced, so the dance.

I'm reviewing a decade old film. This kind of themes is very much done for the current era, particularly in Hollywood. You can't believe this guy did a film like this back then. I'm obviously talking about Ryan Reynolds. It was just for fun, other than that there's nothing to expect from it. Clearly we know how the story begins and ends, but we're only going to see the middle parts, how they developed it, especially the comedies.

All the actors were decent, particularly Amy Smart was much preferred actress than what she's now. Ryan Reynolds with those dual getups was not bad either and Anna Faris was excellent in the comedy parts. Maybe it is a chick film, or close to that category, but the perspective of the story was from a man.

Being a geek in the high school, how he transformed into a handsome man is the film. When he visits his hometown, all the old memories comes back to the life, particularly after seeing his old close friend who he had a crush on her, but never revealed it. So it is like his second and probably final chance to express his feeling. How it all develops and ends was the remaining story.

Being a comedy, it has not delivered anything big. It might have effected good way, if I had watched when it came out. So not everyone who watches it would end up happily. It is not easy to suggest this film for everybody, but if you're looking for a comedy, some comedy, it will work okay.

I enjoyed _Miss Congeniality_, despite the various issues and problematic points I talked about in my review of that film, and I hoped that, at least, this sequel (which is far from being the second part of a bigger film, like Sandra Bullock said she faced all this) would be able to match the original film. Let's be fair, it had everything to achieve this: in addition to keeping the same protagonist and having a script that linked directly to its predecessor, the film kept part of the original crew and cast. Well, I'm sorry, but I feel that those expectations were disappointed: the film is not so bad, but it is below what I expected to find.

The problem starts with the script: it's a very underdeveloped and basic story, despite starting from a promising initial premise. Marc Lawrence, who has worked on the previous film, just couldn't do any better. If the first film was guided by the exaggeration of the story, this one proved to be predictable and has ideas that simply don't work, such as seeing two federal agents, posted outside their area of ​​origin, and who have the luxury of disobeying blatantly to superior orders without this earning them an immediate suspension and the handing over of their weapons and badges. What the movie does is almost make fun of the FBI (well, sometimes they deserve it). Another problem is the melodrama that the protagonist lives after the end of her romance, which started in the previous film. This is irritating enough to prevent us from sympathizing more with the character, who is saved ""in extremis"" by the baggage of previously acquired sympathy.

Sandra Bullock is, frankly, the best asset present in this film. She was not only the producer but also the protagonist and, once again, she offers us a job well done, full of commitment, charm and charisma. Regina King also does quite well as a tough federal agent with anger management issues. The collaboration between both actresses is excellent, and the scenes they both star in are among the best in the film, particularly when they don't understand each other. Heather Burns and William Shatner also return for this film, in their respective roles, but the truth is that they have little to do and don't particularly stand out, apart from the demerit of other actors. Treat Williams tries but fails to do much more than he does, Diedrich Bader is very irritating in the role of a brazen homosexual with cross-dressing aspirations, and the two villains are never credible or exude any sense of real threat.

On a technical level, the film is on average, and that can be evaluated by the cinematography, editing and choice of sets or visual and sound effects. It's not a film where the production has invested a lot in technical issues. The soundtrack also leaves a lot to be desired and doesn't bring any theme or song that stays in the ear. The film's pace is slower than would be desirable, but I wonder if the plot, so confused and disordered, would perhaps allow the adoption of a faster pace without a significant loss of the intelligibility of the story. The humor is quite clever at times, but it barely strays from the conventional family sitcom jokes, puns, wordplay and physical humor (nothing against it, it's humor more suited to a family movie, and I recognize that). The costumes have some interesting ideas, but they don't go beyond what was expected to find.",3.0
10050,"**_Snappy comedy revolving around a Shakespearian high school play_**

A senior (Ben Foster) loses his childhood sweetheart (Melissa Sagemiller) and so joins the school play to win her back despite his lack of theatrical talent. The play is a musical version of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream in which the teen has to deal with the hyper drama teacher (Martin Short) as he gets to know his best friend’s sister (Kirsten Dunst). 

""Get Over It” (2001) is an energetic and innovative teen comedy with good camaraderie and the unique scenario of a Shakespearian play marked by that updated 60's-type aesthetic of the period. The amusing lines, mostly by Short’s character, are so rapid-fire you’ll have to see the movie a second or third time just to get ’em all. I also appreciate the ‘cool’ edge minus the over-the-top sleaze of flicks like the (puke-inducing) “American Pie” series.

Mila Kunis is also on hand in a peripheral role, but she never did anything for me, nor did Dunst or Sagemiller, but they’re all winsome enough. And Jeanie Calleja is notable as the assistant of the drama teacher, Jessica; plus there are some females on the fringes worth a mention. Speaking of which, statuesque Kylie Bax appears in an amusing side role and Carmen Electra has a bit part. 

On the masculine side of things, Short pretty much carries the movie with his over-the-top charisma. Moreover, Colin Hanks and Sisqó are likable as the protagonist’s best friends while Shane West is effective as the arrogant rival.

Remember the high school play in “Dead Poets Society”? Now imagine if the entire movie revolved around that with a wildly witty tone and fast pacing. That’s this movie. It took me a while to catch a grip with its uniqueness but, once I did, I savored it.

The film runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in Ontario at Mississauga (Port Credit) and nearby Toronto.

10056,"Classy, Feverish, a Mess?  

The second feature film directed by future critical darling Stanley Kubrick, Killer's Kiss isn't a particularly good film. With its very basic ""B"" film noir plot, choppy editing, post-dubbing and ""interesting"" acting from the unknown cast, the film should really be a chore to get through. However, it represents a worthwhile investment of our time for two main reasons. One is of course to witness the early work of a most revered and talented director. The other is because of some indelible images that exist within the piece, images crafted around authentic New York locations.

The plot revolves around Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith), a 29 year old New York boxer at the end of his career, and his relationship with a dancer and her violent employer. Love, violence and revenge all crammed into one sweaty New York weekend. Kubrick co-wrote the screenplay with Howard Sackler, he also edited, co-produced and photographed the picture himself. All financed by cash generated from friends and family of the novice director.

While there is nothing to write home about in the writing, certainly there is no hint of the creative writing flair Kubrick would show later in his career, it's with the visuals - and to a lesser extent - the sound work, that this shows that the powerful director was quick out of the traps. The whole film comes across as some feverish fairy-tale, one which at frequent moments shifts to some sort of surrealistic nightmare. The effects are aided by the use of negative film stock and the tilting blend of opposing character scenes. Sexual aggression segues with a brutal boxing match, and a ballerina dancing sequence takes one away from the hustle and bustle of the loud streets. Streets where bizarre fez wearing musicians prance about gaily and where shadowy figures follow men down alleyways to enact a brutal crime. All distorting, memorable stuff, capped off by an axe fight in a mannequin factory, the dismembered parts used not only a weapons, but also as a point of reference to the weird thematics laid down by Kubrick.

With stark black and white imagery augmented by the harsh music, and Kubrick dallying with close ups and low angle camera shots, Killer's Kiss is never less than engrossing from a technical viewpoint. Think of it like that weird dream you had when you had taken too much cough syrup that one time, and you will then be half way there... 6/10",6.0
10057,"What's more overdone? The gratuitous cleavage shots or the catchphrase?

I did enjoy <em>'The Three Musketeers'</em> - but boy is there a load of cleavage shoved in your face. The famous Musketeer phrase is also said <b>a lot</b>.

This film is a little bit of a weird one, in terms of how I feel about it. It's clearly enjoyable but I wasn't sure if it deserves the step above rating that I've given, by the end I think it just about gets there. I like the plot, the locations and pacing, but it took a relative while for the cast to grow on me.

Chris O'Donnell (D'Artagnan) and Oliver Platt (Porthos) would be my standouts, I liked both of them pretty much from the beginning; it's my first time seeing O'Donnell, away from his <em>'Batman'</em> appearances, though have seen Platt a number of times.

Charlie Sheen (Aramis) and Kiefer Sutherland (Athos) are the ones who don't work amazingly in my opinion. I don't love their acting styles here, while I didn't sense enough chemistry between the two - and Platt, for that matter.

Tim Curry, meanwhile, is always hit-and-miss to me - not helped by the fact that <em>'Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties'</em> is my biggest memory of him, I'm constantly hearing Prince XII whenever he talks - my apologies, Mr. Curry.

Lastly for the cast, it's also interesting (for me) seeing Paul McGann involved - I've very recently become aware of him through television's <em>'Luther'</em>. Funny ol' world.

Sorry for the few tangents there. My final thoughts on this film: It's entertaining. Worth a watch.",8.0
10057,"They say a hero is only as good as the villain. If, by the same token, a villain is only as bad as the hero, then The Three Musketeers has, proportionately speaking, the best villains of any movie. Tim Curry and the diabolical Michael Wincott are inspired choices for Cardinal Richelieu and the Count (for some reason Captain in this movie) de Rochefort. In contrast, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, and Oliver Platt as Aramis, Athos, D'Artagnan, and Porthos, respectively, are like the Three Stooges without Moe, Larry, and Curly (i.e., Shemp, Joe, and Joe).

Athos, Porthos, Aramis, d'Artagnan; for those who have read Dumas's Musketeers saga, these aren't mere mortals; they are titans, demigods, princes of the Universe. Even The Man in the Iron Mask – an otherwise bad movie – knew that the Musketeers demand actors who can throw their weight around; in that case, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gérard Depardieu, and Gabriel Byrne (no points for guessing Depardieu's role).

Sutherland is the only film actor among the quote-unquote heroes; the rest are glorified TV stars. Sheen in the role of Aramis is simply outrageous; it's true that both the character and the actor are fond of women, but Aramis likes ladies and Sheen likes whores, and it's safe to say that the actor and the character make their conquests in very different circles. Moreover, Aramis has class, grace, and elegance; Sheen, on the other hand, has exactly what he deserves (this film was released just six years after Wall Street, but Sheen's career even then was for all intents and purposes over). As for O'Donnell, what can you really say about him?

Dumas's original novel opens with one of the best father-and-son heart-to-hearts in literature (although the gold standard remains Polonius and Laertes in Hamlet). At the beginning of The Three Musketeers, though, D'Artagnan Sr. is already pushing daisies; “my father was a musketeer”, boasts Junior; “the personal bodyguard of the King”, to which someone, quite rightly, replies: “the King was assassinated. Your father was a failure"". If it's any consolation, at least he wasn't as big a flop as this movie (which ends on a very positive note, and not just because it's finally over; similar to its protagonists and antagonists, its official theme song is as good as the movie is bad).",1.0
10057,"Ok, first things first - this has nothing at all to do the Dumas' book. We ought to be clear on that before we continue through this Disneyfied interpretation of this classic story. A way too handsome Chris O'Donnell is ""D'Artagnan"" who arrives in Paris determined to follow in his father's footsteps and join the King's Musketeers. There is a fly in his ointment, though - the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) has seen to it that this particular militia has been disbanded in disgrace. Through a series of mishaps, he finds himself facing three duels with erstwhile musketeers - Messieurs Aramis, Porthos and Athos who all end up fighting the Cardinal's guard and unite... Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Oliver Platt are his colleagues as they struggle to restore their legion and simultaneously avert an English invasion, and quite probably a coup to replace the infantile King Louis. It's quite well paced, there is plenty of action and Curry is clearly having a bit of a laugh as the evil churchman. Otherwise, however, it's an unremarkable remake lacking much of the charm and cunning of either the 1948 or Richard Lester's 1973 romp.",6.0
10060,"Get Rich or Die Tryin' reminds me of the apocryphal Chinese curse 'may you live in interesting times'. The most interesting thing that has happened to Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson is that he has been shot nine times; accordingly, not only the character he plays, Marcus 'Young Caesar' Greer, but also a lot of other people get shot in this movie.

Most of them survive, though, so even this turns out to be not so special after all. As for the second most interesting experience in Fifty’s life, this actually happened to someone else: 8 Mile, the vastly superior film starring Eminem and released three years prior.

The problem is that 8 Mile is a story about humility, while GRoDT is about arrogance; the title alone exudes hubris, and the fact that it shares its title with a 50 Cent album makes us think that the inflated ego is not limited to the character, but it affects the star as well. 

Unlike Em, who didn't play himself but played someone very much like him in particular and a real human being in general, Marcus Greer is not so much a fictionalized version of Jackson as 50 Cent's idea of ​​50 Cent. 

Young Caesar is the larger-than-life figure that Curtis Jackson desperately wants to be, to the point that a modest 50 cents is not enough anymore; only a nickname that references arguably the most brilliant political and military mind history will suffice.

This is unintentionally ironic because the protagonist is not the sharpest knife in the kitchen; for example, little Marcus's (Marc John Jefferies) mother is murdered, and the suspect is a ""Rick James-looking motherfucker"" (Leon, criminally underutilized), so Marcus keeps a photo of the Super Freak ever near him, because otherwise he would forget what her mother's alleged killer looks like? 

This is supposed to be a drama, a genre that the filmmaker, having directed My Left Foot and In the Name of the Father, should know very well; on the other hand, the director also wrote those films, so the blame for this inexplicable faux pas falls squarely on the scriptwriter.

The hero's Dickensian childhood was a cliché that 8 Mile could afford to skip because the dysfunctional interaction between Em and Kim Basinger told us everything we needed to know about it without the need for flashbacks narrated in Fifty’s uninflected monotone.

Then again, the soundtrack includes a song called “Window Shopper,” which means a mandatory shot of little Marcus staring forlornly through a window at the sneakers he can't afford, while a couple of extras taunt him.

The director surrounds Jackson with strong supporting cast (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Terrence Howard, the monolithic Bill Duke), but this is a double-edged sword; either they elevate Fifty to their level, or they completely overshadow him until he disappears, which is exactly what happens here.

Now, if Jackson were any smarter or less selfish, he would have let Howard, still fresh from a similar role in Hustle & Flow, play the lead, instead of saddling him with the role of his trusty sidekick Bama. 

Nevertheless, Howard steals every scene he’s in (and has the best lines of dialogue; e.g., ""Bama. Are you from Alabama?"" ""No, North Carolina."" ""Why do they call you Bama?” “I didn't want people to call me Lina”), including the best of them all: a revealing scuffle in a jail shower that preceded the Turkish bath fight in Eastern Promises by two years.

The big difference is that Hustle &Flow is about a pimp who aspires to become a musician, while GRoDT is about a gangbanger who gets distracted too easily: “I had my own space and I could focus on my dream of being a rapper… After three hours, I quit my career as a rapper and went back to selling coke.” In other words, why make an effort when one is such a prodigy that, when imprisoned, the other inmates and even the guards know the lyrics to Young Caesar’s future chart-topping hits?",1.0

It's a derivative mess, this film. It's rooted in so many other stories that are much better executed; there is simply no menace or jeopardy at all, and John Carpenter seems unsure whether he wants an all-out action film or a semi-comedy. Russell is always at his more entertaining with the latter, here he just comes across as a man with a mission who is no more interested in the plot than I was. Steve Buscemi doesn't really add much either as the duplicitous ""Eddie"" and I am sure I spotted Peter Fonda in here too - a payday for a few actors who ought to have known better.

Indeed, he is convinced that there are some crooked goings-on here and determines to investigate.

Soon ""Ashford"" starts to believe his young reporter and things get even more deadly for just about everyone. For some inexplicable reason, auteur David J. Burke lets the audience in on pretty much all of the secrets right from the get go, so there is precious little jeopardy as this set piece narrative unfolds. Timberlake looks good, Kevin Spacey features competently as the investigator of the investigators and Freeman sinks some Scotch meaningfully, perhaps to alleviate the predictability of the whole thing.

10065,"_**Effective haunted house movie with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George**_

A young couple with three children buys an old, large house on Long Island in 1975. The house has a diabolic history, but they purchase it anyway because it's such a great deal. Will they make it out alive? 

I didn’t have high hopes for ""The Amityville Horror"" (2005) because I'm not a fan of haunted house movies and thus had not yet seen the original version. But I decided to give it a try due to Melissa George. The movie maintains a serious tone throughout and did not disappoint; it successfully piqued my interest in the whole Amityville Horror legend, which you can read about on the internet.

Some may accuse the film of ripping off aspects of ""The Shining"" (1980), but keep in mind that the original movie was released a year before ""The Shining"" while the books they were based on were both published in 1977. The difference is that “The Amityville Horror” was inspired by supposedly true events whereas Stephen King’s novel was purely fictional.

Of course this remake inspired me to see the classic version from 1979 with James Brolin and Margot Kidder. What I like about that one is that it takes its time to develop the characters in what is essentially a realistic drama topped off with creepy paranormal happenings. It addresses dark, ugly stuff but it actually has a warm heart (recall what George does in the final scene). This brisk 2005 remake is like the Reader’s Digest version, unsurprisingly upping the ante with the (clichéd) horror elements; it thankfully offers interesting details on the backstory of the house. I think they’re both worth checking out. If you prefer longer with more depth you’ll favor the original version whereas if you want something faster and more modern you’ll appreciate this one. 

Melissa George is a gorgeous woman and I enjoy watching her. Also on hand on the feminine front is Rachel Nichols, who played Tamara in the 2011 redo of ""Conan the Barbarian."" Rachel plays a hippie chick babysitter and she's perfect for the role. The babysitter is haughty and scoffs at the diabolic history of the house but let's just say she leaves as a true believer. This was a great sequence that perked my interest at a time it needed it (as I was starting to get bored by that point). In any event, I had to reassess my appraisal of Ms. Nichols after seeing her in this film as she won my appreciation. Meanwhile Chloë Grace Moretz plays the little girl; she was only 7 when the film was shot.

Ryan Reynolds as the husband is fine, but he seems TOO in-shape for the role. However, I'm sure the ladies appreciate it.

10066,"Engrossing and imaginative modern Mystery/Horror with Elisha Cuthbert 

RELEASED IN 2005 and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, ""House of Wax"" is a horror/slasher about six college students (4 dudes and 2 gals) who drive from Gainesville to Baton Rouge to attend a crucial football game. They end up camping in the woods somewhere off I-10 where some of the party discovers a mysterious town in the sticks that has a curious House of Wax. Horror and death ensue.

This is not a remake of the splendid 1953 Vincent Price cult flick of the same name. The only thing these two films have in common is their title, their genre, and the fact that they both involve a wax museum. It's therefore pointless to compare them as they are two totally different stories. Plot-wise, ""House of Wax"" is an obvious mixture of the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and the 1953 film of the same name, along with elements of more modern flicks like “Wrong Turn” (2003) and torture porn.

Although the first 12 minutes or so are unimpressive with too much annoying shaky cam, the story starts to capture your attention at the camp-out sequence. From there their encounter with a horrible stench, a local hick, and the mystery of the isolated town & wax museum gradually pulls you in. The fairly slow initial 50-minutes are a crucial character-building and mystery-developing foundation to the final horrific hour.

The major protagonist of the story is Carly, played by Elisha Cuthbert, who was only 22 during filming and never looked better with her curvy cuteness. The glamorous and infamous Paris Hilton also stars and does a commendable job, but Elisha basically blows her out of the water as far as all-around beauty goes.

Speaking of Ms. Hilton, in light of the ads to “Come see Paris Hilton die,” it’s no secret that her character does indeed buy the farm and, the way it happens, is pretty amusing. The film's worth checking out for this scene alone, especially if you despise her.

The picture was shot in Queensland, Australia, of all places, but it works alright as a stand-in for the Deep South, although I don’t recall any hills along I-10, as depicted in the background of the town. Speaking of the town, it doesn’t look like a Deep South town, but rather a contrived set. Nevertheless, the filmmaking is top-notch in all categories with the rest of the no-name cast doing a fine job. As a matter of fact, the six college kids are all rather likable; even Nick (Chad Michael Murray), Carly’s supposedly 'black sheep' twin, once he shows his true colors.

""House of Wax"" works fabulously for what it IS, a mystery/slasher flick. The unlikely story is played straight and serious by all involved; there's no silly ""comedic relief"" or camp to be seen. Everyone knows going in that this isn't going to be ""Gandhi."" But if you're in the mood for an entertaining and imaginative mystery/horror picture, look no further. ""House of Wax"" has practically everything you’d want in such a film. Why do I describe it as imaginative? See the conclusion's spectacular melting wax museum and you'll understand; this is F/X at its finest.

The camaraderie between the two brothers is similar to DUMB AND DUMBER, but laughs are even fewer. The maturity level here is so low--among the sparse gags is a lot of bathroom humour – that one might believe this film intended for a less than adult audience, but any plot where artificial insemination has a key doesn't seem likely to target a young demographic. I got this movie because I enjoyed Will Arnett's work on <i>Arrested Development</i> and in an infamous Human Giant sketch where he plays a hyperbolic pervert ultimately killed by a sex machine. His acting here is similar to <i>Arrested Development</i>, and may not be all that great, but he's so much better than Will Forte, one of the most unversatile and unlikeable comedians ever cast on Saturday Night Live.

There was some good stuff to this one when it mattered. One of it's best parts was it's big actions scenes early on with there being two really great chase scenes through the forest in here. The first one is really great, with the suspense of not knowing what's going to happen during the course of the scene, and that makes the initial set-ups with the group appearing at the ceremonial grounds with the prisoner stuck in the middle. Once it switches over to the hunt, it becomes all the greater with the atmosphere from the imposing forest being used to perfection, the wolves' chase is rather fun and the whole thing is a big plus. The second one works with pretty much the same points but with the added benefit of featuring a really nice werewolf battle at the same time. The battle is quite long and enjoyable, using the surroundings and setting quite nicely with the action coming from the realistic wolves that can only be done that way, and it becomes quite exciting. Another rather good part about it is the film's action-packed ending, which is all sorts of awesome from the energetic and engaging street chase where they're jumping around the buildings to the big confrontations inside the hideout. The hideout sequences are the best, with a fine mixture between gunfights, brawling, wanton destruction and even some explosions placed in the mix to end the film on a high-point. The last plus here is the fact that the mythology with the werewolves is impressive and incredibly original, using a lot of the facts known while mixing it in with the new facts presented make for some great times. These here are the film's good points while there were some pretty big flaws to this one. One of the biggest problems is that the film uses real wolves for the transformation into werewolves. It's a cheap ploy, doesn't for the slightest look anywhere near convincing and makes it seem like a horror film was the furthest thing possible from the makers, which isn't a good sign. This is just lazy and makes the whole movie feel quite cheap in the process, besides looking wrong and oddly out-of-place. That feeling also works on the romance angle in here which just feels so tacked on just to have it here that it serves no point. Add onto that the fact that they constitute so much time in the middle segment of the film that almost nothing at else takes place during these scenes, making them quite dull and boring all around. The last flaw is the tameness of the film which is perfectly captured by the rating, which takes out much of the opportunities for this one to be entertaining since it can't show too much blood or gore, and the werewolf kills can't be too intense as the rating implies, which is what really hampers this one here with a series of off-screen or completely bloodless kills in here. These here are the big damaging factors to this one.

10075,"***Dynamic Bucharest werewolf flick feels like it’s in a rush*** 

Two former-American youths meet in Bucharest, Romania, and develop an affinity for each other (Agnes Bruckner & Hugh Dancy). But one of them is a traditional werewolf (a person who can morph into an actual wolf) and is reluctant to pursue a relationship with a regular human. Meanwhile the city’s pack leader (Olivier Martinez) wants the pretty young thing for himself and so sends his son (Bryan Dick) to get rid of the dude.

""Blood and Chocolate"" (2007) was based on the 1997 book by Annette Curtis Klause and debuted 22 months before “Twilight” (2008), which was based on the 2005 novel by Stephenie Meyer. As such, don’t expect a “Twilight” clone.

What’s great about this movie is the magnificent Bucharest locations and the polished kinetic style and great music, not to mention the decent cast. There are elements of “An American Werewolf in Paris” (1997), “The Howling” (1981), “Wolfen” (1981), “Wolves” (2014) and “Twilight” (2008). The last two came out later, of course; I’m just providing reference points.

Unfortunately, ""Blood and Chocolate"" starts out like it’s in a rush, like it’s trying to cram too much material into the first 15 minutes plus cater to people with ADHD. It eventually finds its footing just enough to enjoy it, for the most part, but it needed more room to breathe. The flick only runs 97 minutes; another 20-22 minutes would’ve done wonders. As it is, it feels like it lacks the confidence to slow down and take its time.

As far as comparisons to the book go, the filmmakers dumbed down the plot (naturally) and made it more ""hip.” The book's message was to accept who you are and don't try to be something you're not while the movie's moral is to not let others determine your identity, customs or destiny; go after what you want and do not allow yourself be limited by the hand dealt you or what others say.

10083,"Counting down the hours for some self investigation.

No Way Out is directed by Roger Donaldson and adapted to screenplay by Robert Garland from the novel ""The Big Clock"" written by Kenneth Fearing. It stars Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Sean Young, Will Patton, George Dzundza and Howard Duff. Music is by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by John Alcott.

Already filmed impressively as The Big Clock in 1948, Fearing's ingenious source material gets a shift to a Pentagon backdrop and still comes out a winner. Putting their own spin on the central story, that of a man finding he is investigating ""himself"" during a murder enquiry, the makers unfurl a labyrinthine plot that keeps up the suspense quota right to the very end.

In true noir style, the story is crammed with double bluffs, deceit, sex and death, with the added ingredient of politico intrigue to spice things still further. Cast are led superbly by Costner and Hackman, though Young is a bit too dull an actress to really put fire into the key femme role, and Alcott makes great use of the real Washington locations to bring visual authenticity to the story's setting.

Jarre's score is hokey sounding and doesn't sit right with the dramatics on show, while the big reveal at the finale is still as divisive today as it was back on the film's release, but this is still a fine example of a film noir remake that really works for the neo-noir loving crowd. 8/10",8.0
10083,"Life in DC and The Pentagon during the mid-80s

RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Roger Donaldson, ""No Way Out” is a political drama/thriller starring Keven Costner as a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy who falls in love with a woman of dubious morality (Sean Young) and is thrust into a cover-up/witch hunt after a tragedy. Gene Hackman plays his “boss” at the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense, while Will Patton appears as the Secretary’s loyal and diligent assistant. 

This remake of 1948's “The Big Clock"" makes great use of Washington DC & surrounding area (e.g. Arlington) with sweet opening and closing aerial views. The Pentagon is a focal point with much of the drama taking place in that iconic building. There’s a worthy surprise in the plot so pay attention.    

Roger Ebert overrated this movie in 1987, giving it a perfect rating. The first half is a great setup, but the second half is merely okay and sometimes comes off as a TV production, verging on amateurish (you’ll see what I mean). The photo that the computer slowly materializes is a particularly quaint element; and the distinctly 80’s score doesn’t help. 

Still, there’s enough good here to make “No Way Out” worth checking out if it sounds appealing to you. Although Hackman is almost wasted in a role where he is relegated to sitting around looking concerned, Patton’s passionate work makes up for it; Costner and Young too.   

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in DC, Virginia (Arlington & Alexandria), Maryland (Annapolis) and the Toronto airport. WRITERS: Kenneth Fearing (novel) and Robert Garland (screenplay).

10085,"I think there's something wrong with my corpse.

Could it be that the spirit of a dead cadaver is killing off all those who have medical dealings with her body?

Judging by the unfairly low rating it has on the main internet movie sites, it's very likely that the slow pace and lack of gore has counted against Unrest, which is a big shame. Jason Todd Ipson (director) draws on his real life experiences as a Boston general surgery employee to produce a film of skin itching substance. The premise is nifty and the real location shooting really adds weight to this mortality gone awry tinged horror.

There's a freshness to the film that leaps out, finding a film maker not merely content to pander to the formulaic hordes to win plaudits. Having an impossibly gorgeous female lead (Corri English) as the main protagonist would lend one to think that is not the case, but there's a rawness to English's acting that suits the character perfectly. There's a splendid realism factor to the picture, the blend of the real and the smart effects work nestling nicely together on the mortuary slab.

Atmosphere is a word that has always been key in non blood letting horror parlance, and Unrest has it in abundance. It would have been easy for Ipson to rely on boo-jump shocks, but he doesn't, he uses his knowledge of setting and subject matter to craft a tight and tense thriller that manages to gnaw away at the senses, even ensuring that the cadaver, as dead as she apparently is, is a full and rich character holding court as the body count starts to tot up.

The musical score (Michael Cohen) is a bit intrusive at times, a romantic sub-plot a little pointless, while the finale doesn't quite hit great heights given what has led up to it, but this is a smart dark mood accentuated piece and it is well worth checking out. 7.5/10",7.5
10086,"**A film very experimental and devoid of meaning, but with some notes of quality.**

I didn't like this film. It's a low-budget film, directed by Rémy Belvaux, which basically makes a kind of false documentary around the criminal and violent activities of a cruel and bloodthirsty killer, who accepts being filmed while he kills his victims. A film that looks like an academic work by a film student, and not something made for the public. It will certainly be an interesting film for film students and cinema critics, but it is not something I recommend to the general public.

The film has frankly positive points, starting with the excellent performance of Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main character and is the only character worthy of the name here. Everything else is extras or people who simply have to appear there. The realism is impressive and, at times, shocking, and the cinematography, in black and white, is very good and worked with creativity by the director.

The film's biggest problem is the feeling of amateurism and experimentalism that is felt at various moments. It's also one of those extremely violent films where everything happens without there really being a reason, a reason for being. Much of the film is a succession of violent crimes where there is nothing more than purposeless violence. The killer kills because he does, and it seems that the journalists following him are also filming because they have to film something.",2.0

Jenna's young idealism and optimism inspire her jaded career-focused friends and peers (as well as the audience) to return to the hope and enthusiasm of their youth. 13 Going On 30 has plenty of laughs but also a lot of sincerity.

10096,"""13 Going on 30"" is a romantic comedy film directed by Gary Winick and released in 2004. The movie tells the story of Jenna Rink, a 13-year-old girl who wishes to become 30 years old overnight and wakes up the next day in her 30-year-old body, played by Jennifer Garner.

The movie is a classic example of a coming-of-age story, where Jenna, who was an awkward teenager, discovers the importance of friendship, love, and self-discovery. The film is set in the 1980s and has an upbeat and nostalgic tone that captures the spirit of the era. The movie features a stellar cast that includes Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo, and Judy Greer.

One of the most significant strengths of the movie is the performance of Jennifer Garner. She captures the essence of a 13-year-old girl trapped in a 30-year-old body, and her portrayal of the character is genuine and heartfelt. Her transformation from a bratty teenager to a mature woman is well portrayed, and she delivers an excellent performance.

The chemistry between Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo, who plays her childhood friend, is another highlight of the movie. Their friendship and love story are charming and heartwarming, and their performances complement each other well.

The supporting cast, including Judy Greer, who plays Jenna's frenemy, and Andy Serkis, who plays her boss, also deliver solid performances and add depth to the movie's narrative.

The movie's soundtrack is another strong point, featuring popular hits from the 80s that add to the film's nostalgic feel. The costumes and production design are also impressive, transporting the audience back in time.

One of the drawbacks of the movie is its predictability. The plot is formulaic, and the audience can see the ending coming from a mile away. However, this is a common issue in romantic comedies, and the strong performances and charming characters make up for this flaw.

Overall, ""13 Going on 30"" is an enjoyable and heartwarming romantic comedy that captures the essence of the 80s and delivers a great performance by Jennifer Garner. Despite its predictable plot, the movie's strengths in acting, music, and production design make it a must-watch for fans of the genre. I rate it 6 out of 10.

Two Little Tramps

The most amazing thing about Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid is that it was released in January of 1921. That makes this film 100 years old! A century has gone by since it was made, released, and first viewed, and yet it’s still available to be appreciated anew today. The DVD print that I watched was in very good shape, the picture was great, and I felt that I was watching an important piece of cinema history.

However, The Kid is by no means one of my favorite Chaplin films. In fact, two out of my top three aren’t even silent films, but prime examples of Chaplin’s later work: Monsieur Verdoux (1947) and Limelight (1952). And my third favorite, the 1936 masterpiece Modern Times, is only two-thirds silent!

The plot of the film is quite simple: our beloved Little Tramp finds another little tramp, and and raises the foundling as his own. Years pass, and together, they rise above their life of poverty through the power of love and comedy.

“Professionally funny” is a phrase that I thought a fitting description of Chaplin. He was an artistic genius, and he knew what he was doing and how to engage an audience. In fact, this was his first feature-length film, and he took a whopping five-and-a-half months to shoot it, which was an incredible amount of time for a film production in 1921. Chaplin, of course, not only starred, but wrote, directed, produced, and scored the film!

Jackie Coogan was fantastic as “the Kid”, displaying a wide range of emotion and deftly tugging at the viewer’s heartstrings. His father, Jack Coogan, Sr., coached his son during filming and was paid $125 a week by Chaplin, and also played several small parts within the movie.
Chaplin and Coogan in The Kid (1921)

It is said that Chaplin and Coogan were as close off-screen as on, and every Sunday during the first few weeks of filming, Chaplin would take the boy to the amusement park or other fun activities. This relationship was seen as either an attempt on Chaplin’s part to reclaim his own unhappy childhood, or possibly he was just thinking about his own son whom he had lost, having died three days after birth.

The Kid features a truly bizarre dream sequence in which the Tramp falls asleep on his doorstep and dreams of everyone — including himself — as an angel or demon.

He envisions himself as an angel, with white, feathery wings spread out behind him, and a harp in his hand. Others, including a neighborhood bully, appear as demons, depicted traditionally in dark (presumably red) attire and horns atop their heads. Even a little dog, suspended on wires, comes floating by in a little angel costume!

It’s one of the strangest and most inexplicable dream sequences I’ve seen in a film, and yet it is oddly captivating.

The technical aspects in this film — both in the dream sequence and in the rest of the movie — are marvelous when one considers that it was made a hundred years ago, when the movie medium itself was less than thirty years old.

Whether or not it is one of Chaplin’s greatest works is up to the individual viewer, but you cannot deny that it is a landmark movie, and holds an important place in the history of American cinema. It deserves a look, maybe even more than one. As the opening title card reads, it’s “a picture with a smile — and perhaps, a tear.”",6.0
10098,"An impoverished woman (Edna Purviance) feels compelled to abandon her child in the hope that he might find a better life - so she leaves him (with a short note) in the back of a car. The two men who find the little bundle don't want anything to do with him, so plonk him down behind some rubbish where de is discovered by the tramp (Charlie Chaplin). Now he's not that keen on children either, but the presence of an attentive policeman means can't just leave his new package in the pram of a woman nearby. Skip on five years and the two have become quite a formidable double act - the lad (Jackie Coogan) chucks stones at windows and his father-figure does the mending! Meantime, the mother finds success treading the boards and the boy's real father, likewise, succeeds - but that relationship is toast and she gradually starts to pine for and then search for her lost child. When the authorities cotton on to the lucrative acts of vandalism of the two, they attempt to seize the kid and put him in an orphanage - and that's when things all start to come to an head. There's a delightful bond that develops here between Chaplin and the enthusiastic young Coogan with Chaplin's direction showcasing both their skills and the extent of the poverty amidst which they lived and which drove people to make horrendous decisions to part with their children. The ending is exactly as it should be, so don't go expecting much jeopardy on that front - and the scenes with the angelic wings towards the end mix determination and comedy effectively, too. It makes you smile and pulls at the heart strings and is truly a classic piece of cinema.",8.0
10110,"Empire of the Sun glaringly shines insight into the impoverished wealthy amidst war-torn China. Spielberg is one of a handful of directors that everyone acknowledges. Whether your interest lies with films or elsewhere, he is known to all for his eclectic filmography that tackles nearly every single genre available. The beauty of his directorial talents, is that he can manipulate any subject matter and transform its contents into an accessible piece of entertainment. From hard-hitting crime capers (‘The Sugarland Express’) to the depiction of African-Americans succumbing to racial/sexist abuse (‘The Color Purple’). He has the ornate ability to disassemble history and shape the remnants into his Hollywood mould. But at what cost?

Does Spielberg’s contagious requirement for accessibility downplay the severity of its subject matter? Well, Empire of the Sun may just be the most perfect example to answer the aforementioned question. It illustrates my eternal adoration for the man as an auteur, as well as his damned tendencies that bring down his historical endeavours. A young British boy living with his wealthy family in war-torn Shanghai, becomes separated from his parents where he is soon retained as a prisoner of war in an internment camp.

An epic adaptation of Ballard’s semi-autobiographical novel, that heavily relied on a fictitious narrative to convey his own vivid memories of World War Two. A story of three vital themes that power both the characters and the central narrative. Opulence, faith and humanity. Spielberg commences the first act in a worrying light of unnecessary affluence, following a white family with an abundance of possessional wealth traversing the segregated streets of Shanghai embattled by poverty. The bitter aftertaste of supremacy as “peasants” desperately fight for survival. Whilst it may harken to real events, they make for unlikeable characters due to their careless perception in the environment they are enshrouded in. The father and mother are non-characters, merely acting as fuel for Jim’s coming-of-age journey, and Spielberg paid far less attention to the surrounding chaos which consequently diminished the severity of the war’s impact. It can be argued that the entire story, including the first act, is told through Jim’s perspective. But the naive ignorance to represent the lives that were truly affected was extremely profound.

Then Jim, in the crowded streets of Shanghai, becomes separated from his parents. Mugged, abandoned and lost. His opulent lifestyle relinquished from his selflessness. Gradually, Spielberg constructs an epic that conveys the loss of innocence. This once fragile young boy, unbeknown to the horrors of the world, now utilising his intuition to survive the brutality of war independently. Spielberg definitely downplayed the brutalism of conflict, and instead opted for an endearing focus on Jim’s abrupt development from a timid boy to unsung hero. Unsurprisingly, it worked. Spielberg’s screenplay presents Jim with a plethora of challenges that tests the will of humanity in its entirety. From attempting to escape the internment camp to resuscitating the recently deceased. Jim encompasses every notion of humanity during this heightened time, naturally making him relatable. His actions slowly further his development into adulthood in such a short space of time, with much gratification aimed at Spielberg’s masterful attention to characterisation.

Initially proclaimed as an atheist, Jim experiences metaphysical moments believed to be acts of faith, likening him to a deity of some kind. “Giving life” for a brief moment to the recently passed, which was an ounce of blood pumped to the brain. Witnessing a soul be released into heaven, however counteracted by the infamous Nagasaki atomic bomb. These “acts” grant Jim the power of self-belief, fully realising his potential as the “hero” of optimism.

There’s nothing more optimistic and endearing though than watching a juvenile Christian Bale steal the entire film. Malkovich and Havers ground the enthusiasm of Bale’s performance, yet his commanding presence at such a young age cements him as a talent to behold. Tender moments were handled with delicacy, whilst the louder moments fused with his boisterous personality. Quite simply, one of the best young performances I’ve seen. Williams’ signature score, ever accompanying Spielberg’s work, elevated the grandeur of the spectacular production design yet somewhat exhumed family-friendly vibes commonly found in his previous work. Admittedly that’s a personal conflict of my own, but again did diminish the more powerful scenes. Jim’s fascination with aircraft wasn’t fully realised and felt like an afterthought to coincide with the Japanese “friend” in the final act, although not a substantial detriment to the overall story.

In the blazing heat of war camps, Empire of the Sun shines as an epic that showcases the very reason for my Spielberg idolisation and his cursed ability to lessen the severity of history. Regardless, you’ll laugh, gasp and cry during this coming-of-age tale, and that’s the true beauty of this auteur’s timeless work.",7.0
10110,"_**Even great people have a dud on occasion**_

A British boy (Christian Bale) living with his wealthy parents in Shanghai is separated from them when Japanese forces invade in the early years of WW2. He then has to survive the war in a POW camp. John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, Nigel Havers and Joe Pantoliano play fellow prisoners.	 

Based on J.G. Ballard’s semi-autobiographical novel, “Empire of the Sun” (1987) was Steven Spielberg’s first venture into ‘meaningful’ filmmaking. It’s not without historical interest. For instance, the beginning situation in China is compelling, highlighted by a potent ‘slap’ scene that wakes the pompous kid up to reality. 

From there, though, the movie becomes a tedious prison camp flick with too many ambiguities and drawn-out scenes. Bale does an admirable job in a challenging role, especially considering his age, but IMHO he overdoes it and so the boy comes off hyperactive and annoying. Check out the low-key indie “I Am David” (2003) for a more effective take on similar material.

10127,"The first ""Critters"" movie was a low-budget little monsters sci-fi/horror film that, despite its limitations in money and tech, still managed to strike the right chord in balancing the sci-fi, horror, suspense, and comedy elements, even with a PG-13 rating (despite its theme, only two people actually die in the first movie). Unfortunately, despite the fact that you can see them trying really hard to recapture it, ""Critters 2"" falls short of the mark.

A couple of issues lead to this conclusion. First, despite this film's budget being double that of the first, it doesn't really show. Most of it must have been blown on extra puppets, as this time there's supposedly hundreds of Crites running around causing havoc. Which is weird because, honestly, the Crites feel like they barely have any actual screen time since the plot is also now divided between the attack of the Crites and the townspeople not believing the story of their previous attack and even blaming the attacks on the boy from the first film who has returned to town.

Which leads to the second problem. In the first film, there was an effort to give the Crites some semblance of character. While still voracious eating machines, they still have some minimal interaction with each other and the environment, which fleshes them out a little more. Here, even though we see them talk a couple times (in their own language), it's little more than a one-liner here and there. There's too many of them with no standouts or leaders to give them any character at all.

This all ends up making for a rather dull sequel to a surprisingly entertaining first film. Ultimately, it's not a worthy follow-up.",3.0

Brad (Scott Grimes) just so happens to be in town when they visit the planet. Along with his new girlfriend (Liane Curtis), they team-up to eradicate the extraterrestrial menace of furry critters.  

“Critters 2: The Main Course” (1988) has several highlights, but it’s just no where near as good as the original film from two years prior. For one thing, it’s more cartoonish and goofier, which makes it difficult to suspend disbelief as could be done with the first one. On the positive side, winsome Liane Curtis (Megan) is superior to the actress who played the young female in “Critters,” but the director failed to take advantage of her presence. 

Statuesque blonde Roxanne Kernohan is entertaining as a ‘playmate’ of whom bounty hunter Lee takes the appearance. Her brief top nudity is surprising for a PG-13 flick. Unfortunately, Roxanne would be deceased in just five years due to a car wreck. Speaking of bounty hunter Lee, this ‘nothingface’ alien combined with his partner, Ug, results in the team Ug-Lee.

...but the parts of this movie traumatized me as much as Bambi and Old Yeller.

I just recently tried re-watching it, and had to shut it off because I remembered what was coming. Poachers.

I'm almost 40, I can watch truly horrific movies where humans are harmed in the worst possible ways, but I still can't make it through Gorillas in the Mist.

However, what I can watch I always like. I firmly believe that (aside from the Alien movies) this is one of Weaver's absolutely best roles. That being said, if you can sit through it, bully for you, it is worth it.",10.0
10130,"""Gorillas in the Mist"" is a very worthwhile film and it perfectly highlights Dian Fossey's occasionally groundbreaking work. She actually managed to integrate herself into the mountain gorilla community - this results in some superb shots of the mountain gorilla in its natural habitat and it is genuinely difficult to differentiate between what could possibly be mechanical special effects and the real great apes - and it soon begins to seem as though her gradually all consuming work supersedes many other aspects of her life (she even begins to refer to the gorillas and the mountain they live on as her own) and she willingly sacrifices a blossoming romance with the photographer Bob Campbell in order to stay on the mountain with the gorillas to study them. Dian Fossey achieved recognition through her work and this film ends with the fact the gorilla population continues to multiply as the enduring spirit of her accomplishments lives on, but this coda is juxtaposed with the sobering knowledge that her untimely death remains a mystery.",8.0

In fact, just about everyone in the film right down to the Neo Nazis are treated pretty fairly. But this was the man, with traditionally liberal values, that was able to make Nixon look sympathetic and gave W a fair shake.

Obscene Racists are treated like humans. Gotta love Stone. Any other director would have made them a walking stereo-type with no personality.

10134,"I remember seeing this movie in my youth, back when it was normal to make movies like this. Back then, the stars were named Stallone, Van Damme and Schwarzenegger, and no matter what they did, they couldn't go wrong. We all wanted to be like these. Today, luckily stars need acting skills and not just muscles and a bit of martial art skill. In fact, had this movie been made today, it might even have been a masterpiece to be compared to such post-apocalyptic movies as Children of Men and The Road.

Lets take a brief look at the story, because there is a story hidden here somewhere.

We are in The States, a world that has been destroyed completely by anarchy, genocide and starvation, a world where the plague has spread, keeping the population down to an absolute minimum. Somewhere, scientists have found a cure, though, a cure that everyone wants, for good or bad. A cyborg named Pearl is sent into the world to retrieve this cure, and at the beginning of the movie, we learn that she has found it and is taking it back to the doctors who created her. A cyborg, by the way, is a man (or woman) who have been so heavily implemented with cybernetics that they could no longer be recognized as being humans. Pearl is taken by Fender, a madman who also kicks off the movie as our narrator, explaining how he enjoys this new world. Gibs (played by Van Damme) briefly encounters the cyborg, but is really only interested in killing Fender.

Those two have a dark past, a past that Gibs (or Gibson) relives throughout the movie in long flashbacks. He was once charged to get a small family to safety outside the city, but Fender interfered and tried to kill them. Now he even has one of the children, a girl named Haley, among his pirates.

Gibson is followed by another girl, one named Nady. She is interested in the cure even though Gibs care little for this. They are unlikely travelling companions, but starts out on a big journey towards Atlanta, hoping to catch up with Fender and Pearl, to get revenge... and the cure. Along the way, they encounter many dangers, and finally catch up with the pirates.

Cyborg is a low budget movie that tries too hard. Just take a look at the first scene, in New York. Less is more, and if only the director would have remembered that. If only I had had the option to remove the music, then I might actually have enjoyed the movie a little, but no, there is music in nearly all scenes, with only a few exceptions. Music that wants us to feel certain things, and that wants us to be prepared for what is coming. If only we were talking about a beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, but alas, we are not. So why do I ask if this is a failure, or a masterpiece? Well, what if the director deliberately used poor actors, to tell us something of the human race. What if he wanted us to think that all humans in this future were somehow cyborgs, part man, part machine? Unfortunately, this is not so, the director wants us to feel something for Gibs, Nady, Haley and Pearl, and therefore he makes them all human, a humanity that their acting skills cannot handle. Alas, this is not a masterpiece in any way, but a big failure, a movie with a tolerable plot, but that fails to deliver it in a believable way.

_Last words... my only star goes to the two beautiful paintings of New York and Atlanta that we see in the beginning and end of the movie. These are hauntingly beautiful, but unfortunately, the rest of the movie... is not._",1.0
10134,"Nope, this is not good and we might as well get that out of the way first. Jean-Claude Van Damme does, however, manage to show off his rippled torso quite frequently whilst everyone else just shows off the fact that they can't act and that even if they could, the dialogue is so pathetic that they'd decided not to bother learning their lines. He's ""Gibson"", a retired fighter who has to come to terms with an apocalyptic scenario that has reduced these United States to rubble ruled on the basis of survival of the fittest by the ""Pirates"". Scientists in Atlanta might be onto to a cure for this pestilence, but for that to work then cyborg/human combo ""Pearl"" (Dayle Haddon) has to get some information to them. Meantime, the well informed gang leader ""Tremolo"" (Vincent Klyn) wants the cure for his people instead and so rather easily captures her. With the pieces all in place ""Gibson"" and his feisty new friend ""Nady"" (Deborah Richter) have to fight the ostensibly un-winnable fight against overwhelming odds to try and rescue ""Pearl"". There's not the merest hint of jeopardy here and the action scenes are so badly choreographed and edited together that it makes ""Conan"" (1982) look like Fellini. The repetition in the storyline really becomes irritating after the seventh scene when our hero is slashed to ribbons only to recuperate into an even more deadly ninja - and he's not even the robot. Auteur Albert Pyun clearly had too much time and money on his hands to waste on developing characters or story and what we are left with is unlikely to be on Van Damme's audition tape.",5.0
10135,"The name is Dalton and we thought he would be bigger.  

Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is a highly regarded professional cooler of bars and clubs. He is hired by Frank Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) to clean up his Double Deuce Road House down in Jasper, Missouri. A rough drunken and bloody place, the Double Deuce is just the start of Dalton's problems as he falls foul of town despot Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara).

I don't know if it's the same the world over, but here in Britain a bouncer is very different to that of a doorman. This is something that anyone who has been in and round the profession can attest to. So even though the casting of Swayze at first glance seemed an odd one, his character Dalton (wonderfully essayed by him actually) is the epitome of a doorman cooler, where violence is the last resort and used only in extreme circumstances. All of which makes Road House an interesting film in the context of its subjects, it's only when the makers resort to cheap tricks and heavy formula that the film descends into soggy popcorn fodder.

The fight scenes are competently handled here, and the characters are an engaging bunch (an axis between Dalton and his landlord Emmet is particularly warm). It's also a very sexy film, mucho machismo for the lads and ladies as Swayze buffs up and kicks butt, while Kelly Lynch sets pulses raising as the perfectly toned, obligatory love interest, Doc Clay (this is a world where doctors look and are shaped like Lynch). A huge question remains though as to if Road House means to be as cheese funny as it is? Because outside of the obvious jokes (plenty) there's cringe moments that make you wonder if it's comedy first, hard buttock actioner second? Be that as it may, Road House is an entertaining film regardless. Scorned by many but cherished by a lot, it remains a late 80s genre splicer that now has something of a cult following. See it at least if only for Sam Elliott's delightful turn as Wade Garrett, the cooler with a reputation as big as Jasper itself. 7/10

10136,"So, if something happens to the kid, the whole world goes to hell? 

Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey - one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa.

Is The Golden Child a product of its time? By that I mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity exclusive to late 1980s audiences? For I can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, while the box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986. Yet since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny Eddie Murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but upon revisiting the film you find Murphy at his wisecracking, quipping and charming best! 

Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and templated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, daring reluctant hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain (Charles Dance so splendidly British), vibrant colour photography (Donald E. Thorin), and a cute kid with mystical powers. The film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. 

Ok! so now the CGI demon looks creaky, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really this isn't meant to be taken seriously. Watch as Murphy does a scratch number on a sacred pillar, note his visual comedy when he gets an answer to his question that he can't believe, or enjoy his lines to Charles Dance and to a silhouetted dragon woman - prime Murphy on show. A jolly good show and something of a bad mood lifter when required. 7/10",7.0
10137,"**A good film for children that can, due to its sweetness, make adults feel that they are left in the room.**

Watching this film is like listening to a fairy tale, or a fable, set in our days. It's the best way I've found to describe it. What we have is a family that decides to adopt a little white mouse, orphaned, after a visit to an orphanage, and that will count on the hostility of the house cat, unhappy that it now has a mouse as its owner.

I saw the movie when I was a kid, at the cinema, and I really liked it. Now, more than twenty years later, I decided to see him again as the adult person that I am and I had a slightly different feeling. The film is extremely simple, Rob Minkoff's direction managed to understand the sweetness and simple effectiveness of the work he had in hand, but was not able to moderate the sugar. That is, we feel, several times during the film, that there is an excess of sweetness, and this makes the adult audience feel like they are too much in the room. I felt it now and that was the big problem with the film for me, a problem that most kids will have ignored without much difficulty.

If little Stuart is a truly adorable character, the same may not be consensual when we think of his adoptive family. The characters weren't as well developed as they could have been, even considering it's a movie for children and young people. Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie do a very good job as the parents and Jonathan Lipnicki is not far behind, lending his character a welcome authenticity. Even so, there remains the question of what the actors could have done with better material in their hands. The work of the voice actors is quite good. Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane deserve full attention in this department.

On a technical level, I think we really have to highlight all the CGI animation involving the animals and their attitudes on a positive note. The effects are also very well done and you can see that there is some financial investment in the film. Of course, a small, almost toy house in the middle of Central Park, one of the most expensive plots of land imaginable, is hard to believe, but that's a detail. The very familiar-looking sets and costumes, hinting at the 50s a bit, were also a nice addition, and the soundtrack does a smart job.",8.0

So we were finally able to buy tickets BUT we were seated separately. It was fine though. The movie kept me entertained. Except for the guy near me who was snoring pretty loud, the movie was great.


Of course Robert Downey Jr was amazing as always. There might be weird critics with this movie but for me, I liked it. The action scenes were just right. It wasn't too much and it wasn't too little. It was weird seeing Don Cheadle though play Terrence Howard's character. I like Terrence better. And then there's Scarlett Johansson who is really sexy although I think there weren't that many acting for her in this movie. There weren't many lines. And what was weird also was that in this movie, the chemistry between Tony Stark and Pepper was not that much compared to the first movie although in this movie they actually ended up together. But all in all I liked the movie. Seeing old characters from the first movie and new characters. I can't wait for a 3rd Iron Man movie.

10138,"**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**

I find, the best way to look at this movie, is as two movies. Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.

On the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it's about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it's this pretty okay action film that's worth taking a look at. Then, there's this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn't really a genre, it's just about the characters interacting with each other, it's about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets _Iron Man 2_ apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.

When films go franchise-style, it's inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it's an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in _Iron Man 2_ when Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character's first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are ""Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it. Let's move on. Drop it."" Very classy.

Although Mickey Rourke (_Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables_) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who's a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (_The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost/Nixon, Moon, Conviction_) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark's. Scarlett Johansen (_Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit_) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (_Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds_) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it's all good news.

The Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn't really work out. Once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, 'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; ""Congratulations sir, you have created a new element"", is a little flawed.

Though if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that _Iron Man_ is the better of the two films, but _Iron Man 2_ has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly. I wait with baited breath for the next Marvel film to come out, _Thor_.

10138,"**A predictable sequel that continues the story of the first film without, however, being as good as it is.**

After an excellent first movie, this was a predictable sequel, but I have to admit that the movie is a bit over the top and that, sometimes, it feels like a very expensive video game. Furthermore, the main character, Tony Stark, is perhaps one of the nastiest and most irritating comic heroes, and this movie seems to try to accentuate that by turning the protagonist into a spoiled playboy who has expensive toys and looks at women like if they were, also, toys. Okay, I know the character was also portrayed like that in the original books, even though I'm not a comics fan. But the movie could give something that made Tony Stark someone we could really care about.

In this film, the hero will face his first great antagonist, the son of a Soviet scientist that Stark's father knew. At the same time, Stark has to face the US Army, who are eager to get their hands on the combat suits he created, discovering that his father knew of a new chemical element, not yet officially discovered, and in which lies the key for the survival of Stark himself. With these brief lines, we can see, right away, that the script is not exactly one of the strong points of the film. The feeling that remains is that the script shoots in several directions, trying to create a more complex story, but that something got in the way and prevented that objective.

The cast basically has the same names as the previous film. Robert Downey Jr. is back to the red armor for yet another film, where he has shown himself to be deftly sarcastic and irritating without losing his heroic pose. Mickey Rourke is a welcome addition to the cast, playing the villain. The actor was able to adapt to the character quite competently. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also return, but they don't do more than they did in the previous film, still fulfilling what was asked of them. Scarlett Johansson deserves a praise for her work here, but the rest of the cast just do what needs to be done.

The film is yet another very expensive blockbuster, abundantly financed by Marvel, and it is very obvious that it will become one of the most watched films of the season. With so much money and financial interest involved, the film was doomed to a loud and flashy bet on high-quality, but still obviously false, effects and CGI. The film has a lot of action and the fights are excellent, although obviously choreographed and stilted. The cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and magnificently beautiful. The film bets a lot on quality props, good sets and costumes, as well as a good soundtrack.",7.0

10139,"Milk shakes its nutrient-rich substance to produce a delectably important biopic. No fat free milk. No semi-skimmed froth encrusting the top layer. Lactose is included. Just whole Harvey Milk dairy, freshly pasteurised by superlative direction and sharp writing. Much like fine wine, Milk tastes exquisitely with age, consistently complementing current democratic strands of chaos. Highlighting the significance of a single vote in a referendum without glorifying the omnipotence of activism.

Harvey Milk, for all intents and purposes, was the first openly gay individual to be elected for public office in the shining state of California. Combatting initiatives such as Proposition 6, the banning of homosexuals to acquire careers in public schools. As a homosexual myself, who had been unfortunately suppressed into the “closet” due to fear of zero familial acceptance, Harvey Milk can only be described as an LGBT hero. The focus on political lobbying and general activism never dissipates, with Van Sant constantly presenting Penn as a voluptuous sculpture for gay rights. And, whilst it would’ve been supremely simple to resort to a melodramatic approach by documenting the several deaths and polygamous relationships in Milk’s life, Van Sant opted for a subversive aesthetic.

By combining archival footage of police raids and controlled protests with the core dramatisation, Van Sant effortlessly blended a documentarian style with a standard biographical narrative. In doing so he enabled Milk to remain human throughout, retaining an ever-important reminder of the work that he had lovingly committed to, not just for his own acceptance into the community, but for every LGBT representative.

Ingeniously, Black addressed Milk and Moscone’s assassinations from the offset, establishing a flashback narrative structure to illustrate Milk’s political career. From opening a store entitled Castro Camera to campaigning against Christian fundamentalists. Black’s audacious dialogue inserted a substantial amount of characterisation, often resorting to humour and sassy quips, whilst tackling the heavier subjects at hand. Further humanising Milk and his supporters. The representation of opposing conservatives were also well-developed, with Milk’s fellow supervisor White gaining the most traction in comparison to Briggs and Feinstein. Offering a clash of perspectives in the democratic environment, eventually building up to a subdued yet profound climax that unleashed an endless candlelight vigil lighting up the streets of San Francisco.

Van Sant’s astute direction, specifically the inclusion of multiple one take sequences of delicious dialogue, would not have been as effective if it wasn’t for one element. An aspect to which the entire biopic relied on. Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. Without a doubt, one of the greatest performances to ever grace our screens. Rarely do I take issue with heterosexual actors portraying homosexuality, and his unanimously acclaimed performance is a valid reason why. Very shortly after his presence was noticed, subverting his typical “hard as nails” gritty roles, I no longer saw Penn. Through sheer mannerism changes, he transformed. The whispering voice, the exaggerated hand motions and the gentle personality. Deserving of any and all awards that he received.

Hirsch was just as transformative portraying fellow supporter Jones, fully embodying gay culture into a singular character. Brolin and Luna also offering noteworthy performances. Franco on the other hand failed to replicate the same quality. His monotonous delivery felt reminiscent to ‘Pineapple Express’ or any other stoned comedy. Elfman’s score, whilst enabling a lighter tone throughout, occasionally overwhelmed the more emotional sequences. Some jarring jump cuts edited by Graham also further relinquished the effectiveness of Milk’s central character and the pace.

However, as a dramatisation of a leading figure in LGBT history, Van Sant delivered the goods. Yet, as a reminder for both heterosexuals and homosexuals alike for how archaic life was, Milk is absurdly powerful. As a “fellow degenerate”, I stand alongside everything that Harvey Milk represented, enabling the LGBT community to come “out of the closet”.",8.0
10139,"A brilliantly informed piece of history. I learnt more than I thought I would and enjoyed it even more. Enjoyed probably isn’t the word as it’s a disgrace that any of this had to happen but overall it’s an empowering film of right over wrong. 

I feel slightly more informed about LGBT history now than I did before the film, ready for LGBT history month (every February).  
The acting is really good and believable but I have to admit I found it difficult watching straight actors cast as gay men fighting for fair representation of gay people. 

This is a spotlight on a part of LGBT history that is rarely told outside LGBT circles so maybe Penn brought the message to a more mainstream audience.  My view of Sean Penn's acting ability has changed based on this movie. Penn is an enigma in his controversial views on masculinity and gender but this was brilliantly acted, executed and researched and I wasn’t expecting to say that when I loaded the video.

10140,"Growing up in the Canada in the 70's and 80's, I fondly recall vastly enjoying an animated version of Lewis' 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' that was presented by Kraft on CTV. Now as a father of a son, I want to see with him the contemporary versions of the books I adored in my youth, though at present I greatly prefer the craftsmanship of cinema pre-1970.

It never bothers me in the slightest, to the ire of my more obsessive-compulsive cinephilic friends, seeing films of series with complete disregard to their order (one of my friends nearly had a heart attack, when he discovered I had watched 'Spider-Man 3' without having previously watched films 1 and 2--don't even get me started about the 'Harry Potter' series...), so, especially curious about how one of my favourite contemporary directors, Michael Apted, would do in the realm of big-budget, CGI-intensive fantasy filmmaking (I expected a fish-out-of-water, like Lord Richard Attenborough helming 'A Chorus Line'), I gave this a shot.

I enjoyed this more than 'Harry Potter' films I have seen, though it does stretch things from the literary works, but unfortunately, that seems to be the way things are, since film became less about artistry and more about business (just see at Toys R Us how many possible toys you can purchase, and similar commercial off-shoots, and I don't even consider this series a major player in this sort of area, because of its Christian undertones, which really doesn't mesh perfectly with selling tons of toys, though of course the realms aren't mutually exclusive, not by any stretch of the imagination). I think that Apted did a decent job, especially considering that yes, he is a fine director, but this isn't really his cup of tea. I distinctly feel that if these films are your comfort food, you won't be disappointed. I look forward to checking out the series' two preceding entries, and, though they left an opportunity for more films, which I believe wouldn't be from Lewis' works at all, it was a nice summation at its conclusion.

<em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'</em> is, comparatively, bad. It loses the vibe and all the intrigue that the first film has, as it continues the downward trajectory set by the other sequel. However, it's still just about got a decent adventure feel to it.

Only two of the youngsters reprise their roles 'properly', those being Georgie Henley (Lucy) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund). I'd always prefer a cast to remain the same, but if I'm honest this doesn't miss William Moseley (Peter) and Anna Popplewell (Susan) all that much. That argument is helped by the arrival of a young Will Poulter as Eustace. He's great.

Plot-wise is where it gets meh. I didn't care for it, even if I did like its swashbuckling nature. I can see many finding enjoyment with it, but for me it doesn't quite come out positively unfortunately - it's sluggish. The ship set also feels rather cheap.

Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is directed by Frank Oz and written by Dan Launer, Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning. It stars Michael Caine, Steve Martin, Glenne Headly and Anton Rogers. Music is by Miles Goodman and cinematography by Michael Ballhaus.

Two con-men from different ends of the spectrum, prey on women's good nature to fund their lifestyles. Both operating out of the same Mediterranean town, they agree that the town simply isn't big enough for the both of them. They strike a bet where the first one to get fifty thousand out of the chosen female target, gets to stay in town while the other has to leave.

A loose remake of Bedtime Story (1964) that starred David Niven and Marlon Brando, Frank Oz's picture is deliciously amoral, sly, clever and very funny. Boosted by the casting of Caine (oily slick) and Martin (live wire bottom feeder), who are both having a wonderful time of it, the film unfolds in a whirl of bluffs, chaos conning and oneupmanship. The story is slight for sure, but as the comedy set-pieces come and go, the ribs are tickled and the surprises that the makers have in store for us late in the day, are truly inspired. The French Mediterranean makes for a visually pleasing backdrop, while Goodman's score is consistently upbeat and perfect for such mirthful shenanigans.

They are dirty, they are rotten and they are definitely scoundrels, but once your belly has subsided form the laughter, you may find yourself wondering just how the makers got you to cheer on such shifty characters?! The answer? Inspired casting and smooth construction of plotting by the director. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, a real joy. 8/10",8.0

This information leaves you forewarned and continually on the alert during every twist of the story, but that is never a consideration on this occasion.

Based on a true story, the arrogant sergeant (Sean Penn) of a 5-man squad on a reconnaissance mission in Vietnam in November, 1966, decides to kidnap a Vietnamese farm girl for some “portable R&R” because it would be ""good for the morale of the squad."" But PFC Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) refuses to participate and fears being “killed In Action” for dissenting.

“Casualties of War” (1989) separates itself from other Vietnam War movies by focusing on the incident at hand, including the build-up and aftermath. Its uniqueness is augmented by Brian De Palma’s slightly off-kilter style. The picture balances the beauty of the location and the artistry of Brian De Palma's filmmaking with the horror and ugliness of war & rape.

It's also realistic and compelling while simultaneously being mundane, which is why some viewers might find it boring. In other words, this is more of a gut-wrenching war drama with some action than a typical war flick with explosions and action thrills galore. It fairly closely follows the real story; Google Incident on Hill 192 for details.

The movie runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, with the original Theatrical Cut being 6 minutes shorter. It was shot in Phang Nga, Kanchanaburi & Phuket, Thailand, and Dolores Park, San Francisco, California.

10142,"""Casualties of War"" is a deeply disturbing and emotionally overpowering film which remains strictly impartial throughout and it just recounts the acutely distressing and repugnant details in a dramatically harrowing yet still compelling way. The rape itself is dealt with in an incredibly matter-of-fact fashion as indeed is the victim's very life when she is indiscriminately murdered after she becomes an inconvenience. It is also shocking but to be expected that when Private Eriksson brings squad leader Sergeant Meserve's criminal act to the attention of his superiors he is met with a lack of concern and even a measure of anger. The real area of upset for them lies not with a lack of justice for the victim, but with the lives of the young men in the platoon Eriksson is about to destroy.",10.0
10145,"Love vs. cold analytical thought

RELEASED IN 2004 and directed by Joseph Ruben, ""The Forgotten"" relays the story of Telly (Julianne Moore), a mother who discovers all traces of her deceased 9 year-old son have been erased, including photos, videos, documents and the memories of other people. Her psychologist (Gary Sinise) and husband tell her she's delusional, but she KNOWS otherwise. Thus begins a thrilling search for the truth wherein she teams-up with Ash (Dominic West) and tangles with NSA agents and more.

The reviews to “The Forgotten” couldn't be more opposite, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since some of the best artistic items polarize opinion. The film admittedly has weaknesses and those who don’t like it zero-in on these flaws.

In style, it is similar to ""The Mothman Prophesies"" (2002), but not as good, intricate or artistic. There are similarities to The X-Files with the two protagonists, one being a female redhead, searching for the truth in what is essentially a sci-fi/mystery tale with the government somehow being involved.

Because of the highly mixed reviews I was watching the first 15 minutes only half-attentive, but when Telly (Moore) confronts Ash (West) and subsequently teams-up with him my attention perked up. Ash is an ex-NHL player who's given up on life and turned to alcohol to drown out his sorrows. What tragic event happened that would cause him to throw in the towel and turn to the bottle? I'll leave that to you to discover.

Anyway, remember the great masculine actors of the past, like Charlton Heston, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds and perhaps even Marlon Brando? There was just something about them that set ’em apart and made you take notice when they were on screen. Dominic West is such an actor. He's reminiscent of James Remar, whom you might remember as Ajax in ""The Warriors"" (1979).

The subplot of Ash's drunkenness struck a chord with me because I know people, incredibly talented people like Ash, who've essentially given up and given in to alcohol, wasting their lives away. Not to mention the fact that I've been seriously tempted to give up as well at times (albeit not to alcohol). I can relate and I'm sure you can too.

As noted, the film is a sci-fi/mystery tale and therefore the explanation (no spoilers) is rather outlandish, but not necessarily unbelievable. ""Flightplan"" (2005) was a similarly-themed film; although its explanation was not outlandish, just totally unbelievable. So if you can't handle outlandishness I suggest you forget ""The Forgotten.""

""The Forgotten"" is essentially a story of love v.s. cold analytical thought. Personally I fall right in the middle between these two dynamics. This conflict is what made the character of Spock so fascinating. Remember the Star Trek episode ""This Side of Paradise"" where he was able to walk free of his strict adherence to logic and experience the warmth & joy of love for the first time? At the end of the episode he sadly states that it was the first time in his life that he was truly happy.

""The Forgotten"" is a story of tortuous struggle and potential triumph, for both Telly and Ash. Although logic is important, love is more powerful. Not to mention warmer and life-inducing.

The film is short and sweet at a mere 1 hour and 26 minutes before credits. The DVD features an extended cut with an alternative ending wherein the possible conspiracy is less malevolent. Watch the theatrical cut first and then simply go to the deleted scenes section and watch the two deleted scenes and the alternate ending (unless you want to watch the ENTIRE film twice, that is; it's just not necessary). I'll say this: the kissing scene should have never been omitted. It works. But perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to paint Telly as a potential adulterer, which isn't a bad thing.

Don't listen to the grumps who didn't 'get' ""The Forgotten."" The reason they didn't 'get' it is because their pendulum veers too heavily toward cold logic, but they don't have to stay that way. :)

10149,"**A set of stories, more than a story made up of stories.**

This film reminded me, in a certain way, of a polite version of “Clerks”, an unorthodox comedy where everything revolves around a convenience store, a video club and two employees from those same stores. Here, everything revolves around Auggie Wren's tobacconist, who takes a picture of the shop every day, at the same time. In one of them, by chance, the deceased wife of one of the store's customers appears who, after being saved from being run over by a boy, decides to help him.

The film is discreet, does not have great cinematography resources, nor visuals. Everything here revolves around the characters, their individual stories, the way they intersect and interconnect. The script is very important for the film, but the work of the actors cannot be overlooked either. Harvey Keitel does a very worthy and well-executed job, and William Hurt, Harold Perrineau and Forest Whitaker follow him closely, so we have a good cast working hard. The big problem with this movie is that it really doesn't have much more to offer. For those who like films that are very much based on characters, their behavior, their stories, and well-written dialogues, the film is wonderful. For anyone hoping this all boils down to a story that is more than a set of stories, the film may be disappointing.",5.0

10153,"**_The power to actualize your thoughts and fears_**

A huge spacecraft at the bottom of the Pacific ocean with a strange, humming sphere found inside. A team of scientists are sent down to investigate – a psychologist (Dustin Hoffman), a mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), a biochemist (Sharon Stone) and an astrophysicist (Liev Schreiber). Two notable characters at the station on the ocean floor are played by Peter Coyote and Queen Latifah. Mystery and (some) horror ensue.

Based on Michael Crichton's 1987 novel, ""Sphere"" (1998) intermixes elements of other scif-fi flicks, like ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""Solaris,"" ""Alien,"" ""Galaxy of Terror"" and ""The Abyss."" Like those movies, the plot involves a small group of people who are isolated from society and encounter the unknown. The theme is the actualization of one's thoughts and fears and the potential for good or, more likely, bad that comes with it. Are we mature enough as a species to handle such power?

Of course, we already have this power, just not to the degree depicted in the story (seemingly). Anything important that we do, whether productive or destructive, is formulated within first and then manifests without, like a song or a book or a loving relationship. If we truly knew the power at our disposal we'd hardly be able to sleep at night we'd be so excited!

The first hour or so is quite good because the film definitely makes you feel like you're at the bottom of the ocean. The mystery is engaging and the actors formidable. Unfortunately, some parts of the second half don't work so well, which destroys the illusion of the movie. As far as the ending goes, it features tricky material that's not easy to pull off. The fact that it's somewhat successful is largely due to having great actors.

Despite the murkiness of parts of the second half, the theme is great. This isn't a slasher film in space, like ""Alien,"" and refuses exploitive thrills, like ""Galaxy of Terror."" Rather, it shoots for well-acted drama and thought-provoking ideas. However, there are some harrowing aspects, like the jelly fish sequence.

While many lambaste ""Sphere,"" it wasn't the box office dog you might think in light of the bad press. It made $37 million (in 1998 dollars) in the USA alone, which is hardly a clunker. The problem was that it cost over twice that to make.

It runs 2 hours, 14 minutes.

QUESTIONS ON THE THEME (***Don't read further unless you've seen the film***)

Why is it that the dark side of the human subconscious is empowered by the alien technology/entity? Why not the positive side? The four scientists (and the others) strike me as quality souls who pretty much have it together. While not perfect human specimens, they're strong people who have their phobias and destructive emotions under control. So why aren't their GOOD, PRODUCTIVE thoughts/desires manifested rather than the bad? I could see if the story took place in a prison and the characters were pieces of sheet, but that's not the case.

10157,"**An honorable sequel.**

This film is a sequel that came out the year after the release of its predecessor, making the best use of the box office success achieved. Although many may not even agree with me, I believe it managed to reasonably match the initial film, and helped to consolidate the nascent franchise and give it popularity, which TV later took advantage of.

The script continues the story told in the first film, with the newly graduated police officers taking on their first and thorny mission: to reinforce the weakened and demoralized contingent of a police station in a troubled neighborhood, headed by the brother of the Academy Commander. Of course, one of the bosses is keen to take his place, and will do whatever he can to get in the way. The script continues not to be particularly inspired, and to demonstrate several weaknesses, but it does the essential and reasonably sustains the film. It is not, however, as effective in this task as the first film. On a positive note: the nudity we saw in the initial film has all been stripped away here, making this film reasonably more suited to the family context.

The cast is almost entirely inherited from the previous film and the more familiar and solid faces will be the ones that will sustain the bulk of the action here. Once again, Steve Guttenberg once again stands out and has an unmistakable role. Still, Art Metrano manages to steal our attention every time he appears on the scene, and he's really funny and good at what he does. David Graf, Bubba Smith, Lance Kinsey and especially Bob Goldthwait are actors who deserve praise for a job really well done. I really liked Goldthwait and the way he gave his character a touch of unpredictable madness. Marion Ramsey is in a more low-key position here, but she does what she can with what little she's been given. The film has good sets and costumes, and the cinematography is regular, but it works well. The soundtrack brings back the main theme we already know, but it doesn't present anything that is really interesting anymore. The film has a very good pace and is not tiring.",6.0

By the time A Nightmare on Elm Street had rolled around to this, part five, Freddy Krueger had long stopped being a scary bogeyman. He was now a figure of fun, a purveyor of one line quips, while the makers were desperately trying to come up with new ideas in which to have the pizza faced Krueger still exist, and thus have more films for him to be in...

His family, a typically large one, is headed up by his dad (Ray McAnally) who presents us with a variation on the usual theme of father who comes home from work then hits the pub, then the family. He's ultimately a loving man who deeply cares for his young son, as does his mam (Brenda Fricker) who must juggle the plates of her other children, making ends meet and gradually understanding and providing for the stimulation that their young son ""Christy"" is clearly craving. It's moving but not in a sentimental way; it looks at an Irish society that can be hugely judgemental but also hugely kind. It personifies well the difficulties faced by many a working class family, even those with solely abled-bodied members; it questions some of the more traditional ""Christian"" values of a community and intimately tells us a touching story of achievement against the odds arrayed against a young man whose very survival isn't to be taken for granted.

The Lawnmower Man is directed by Brett Leonard who also co-writes the screenplay with Gimel Everett. It stars Pierce Brosnan, Jeff Fahey, Jenny Wright, Geoffrey Lewis, Jeremy Slate and Dean Norris. Music is by Dan Wyman and cinematography by Russell Carpenter.

 

Dr. Lawrence Angelo (Brosnan) is a big mover in the science of virtual reality. When he tries his new technology  on mentally challenged gardener Jobe Smith (Fahey), it elevates him to a higher intelligence and it’s not long before Jobe acquires scary new powers…

 

Originally meant to be, and titled as, Stephen King’s Lawnmower Man, the film eventually, after a King lawsuit, ended up bearing very little resemblance to the author’s short story. There’s a couple of small ligaments that link the two, but in the main (not Maine) this Lawnmower Man is its own entity and an obvious attempt to cash in on the then virtual reality zeitgeist.

 

Lawnmower Man has a cult fan base, of that there is no doubt, where much like Tron from 10 years earlier, the effects work and the capturing of something very much being “in” with the youth of the time,  has proved perpetually appealing to nostalgists. But strip away these and you have your basic Frankenstein story for the 90s, a pretty standard story lacking intelligent smarts or deep thematic points of worth. And then of course there is the bizarre fact of having a film decrying the advancement of computer technology, by using computer technology to make the film’s strongest moments! Hee. It’s only adequately performed by the cast, and Leonard’s direction matches his writing, which is mundane when not about the visual effects; effects work that dated very quickly as it happened.

 

Other cuts and sequels would follow, the former didn’t improve the same basic problems of the theatrical cut, the latter releases proved to be laughably bad.

This may because I didn’t utilize the subtitles and therefore missed a lot of the highly accented verbiage, which is a mistake when a movie is dialogue-driven, like this one. The depiction of intelligence work is presumably realistic (as opposed to 007), but static, boring, cynical and with little human decency.

Next time I watch it I’ll be sure to use the subtitles.

The film runs 2 hour, 3 minutes, and was shot in Moscow & Leningrad and points nearby; as well as Lisbon, Portugal (Barley’s flat); Bowen Island, British Columbia (American Intelligence 'safe house'); and London (book fair & jazz concert), as well as nearby Pinewood Studios.

10170,"Sean Connery at least looks like he's having some fun in this otherwise rather dry adaptation of the John Le Carré tale of Cold War espionage. He's ""Barley"", a publisher who is recruited by MI5 to investigate a secret document sent from the USSR purporting to itemise their nuclear arsenal. Needless to say both the British and their CIA counterparts are wetting themselves at the very thought of this being real, but that needs to be verified - and that's where they recruit ""Barley"". He travels to Moscow to meet the author, codenamed ""Dante"" (Klaus Maria Brandauer) and it's whilst there he becomes increasingly distracted by his ""editor"" (Michelle Pfeiffer) - a woman whom his source claims never to have met! As the plot develops, it becomes clear that strings are being pulled but also that ""Barley"" is beginning to think on his own, and not necessarily with his brain either. Will he stick to the plan or will he throw a spanner in the works of his Western handlers? It's a solid enough story but it's padded out far too thinly. There's no chemistry between the characters from Connery and Pfeiffer (and her ropey accent) and though there are plenty of red herrings to fuel the intrigue, that's all delivered in a remarkably sterile and disjointed fashion. Le Carré's stories always focussed on detail and this film rather skirts over that in favour of developing the burgeoning romance, and that rather neuters the sense of suspense that's also not really helped by the blandness of James Fox and Roy Scheider. It's watchable, but nobody's finest two hours.",6.0
10173,"""Hatcher"" (Steven Seagal) has to come out of retirement when a lethal gang of Jamaican drug dealers decide to avenge themselves upon him and his family after he killed one of their number when he was an American DEA agent. After some initial skirmishes, he sets out with his two friends ""Max"", a singularly deadly football coach (Keith David) and Chicago cop ""Charles"" (Tom Wright) to hunt down ""Screwface"" (Basil Wallace). It's procedural, totally devoid of any originality and brutal at times - but then it is a Steven Seagal film, so that ought not to be a surprise. The dialogue (""I'd give you the sweat off my balls!"") is best overlooked most of the time and the quality of the acting from the star on down is pretty ropey. In it's favour, it is an end-to-end action movie with plenty going on, but after you have seen it I suspect you will wonder just how Seagal ever became such an hot box office property. He is completely charm free, as is much of this mediocre vendetta movie.",5.0

The film, to me anyway, has such an odd feel to it throughout, there's a weird mix of story elements and I'm not convinced it all works - and yet, I  actually really like it... I think. In parts, though, if I closed my eyes it would sound like one sorta movie and if I covered my ears it would look like a different one.

What I mean is, the music doesn't quite match the onscreen events. Is the music good? Sure, but the more dramatic pieces don't fit with the rough and tumble nature of the plot. With that said, I do really love how the film begins/ends and how it all comes full circle - coolly done. The flick utilises flashbacks excellently, also.

Cast-wise, it's absolutely solid. Søren Pilmark is an able lead, while Ulrich Thomsen, Mads Mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas, among a few others, are good behind Pilmark. I will say that the latter's part of the storyline with Sofie Gråbøl was off, it wraps up disappointingly... especially given *that* moment with Pilmark's Torkild, which should've sealed the opposite outcome.

Interesting that Thomsen, Mikkelsen and director Anders Thomas Jensen would go on to make <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/adams-apples/"" rel=""nofollow"">Adam's Apple'</a></em> together five years after this. One of the flashbacks in this actually features heavy similarities to that 2005 film, which was presumably inspired by the short story used here.

10183,"Well it's certainly aptly titled as we head to a northern New York reservation where the Mohawk people live on the border with Quebec. There's precisely no opportunity here, so many of the locals really only subsist from hand to mouth on government handouts. ""Ray"" (Melissa Leo) has two young children; a hapless, gambling, husband and lives in a dilapidated motor home from which they hope to soon escape. The husband does a bunk though, and that leaves her in the lurch and struggling to pay the bills. At this point, serendipity takes a hand in her life with a chance meeting with ""Lila"" (Misty Upham). She's also a single parent who is also struggling to make ends meet. Initially, their meeting does not go well - certainly not for the bloodied ""Ray"" - but their communal needs quickly see them working together to help with some smuggling across the now frozen St. Lawrence River. What are they smuggling? People! That's also adding to the dangers of their illicit operations as the police and immigration authorities know what is going on, and are determined to clamp down. The women have goals in mind to improve their lives, but can their good fortune hold against the cold, the terrain and the authorities relentless pursuit? This is an interestingly bleak character study of families in communities which little hope. These women are trapped in a repetitious cycle that they never have enough money to escape, and here that relentlessness spreads to their offspring - especially the young ""T.J."" (Charlie McDermott) who is ill-equipped emotionally to adopt the role of ""man of the house"" whilst his mother is out trying to raise the cash to keep a leaky roof over their heads. There develops quite a poignant chemistry between the two women as their initial hostility becomes something more akin to an inter-dependency and auteur Courtney Hunt does imbue a sense of the hopelessness but also the aspirations of her well portrayed characters. Maybe not the cheeriest of films, but who'd have ever thought Pakistani folks would be entering the USA via Canada across a river of ice?",7.0
10189,"When it comes to comedy, I'm like a patchwork. My favourite kind is the one I grew up with which is the Looney Tunes cartoons. I can watch them over and over again, and I will always laugh. I also love dark British humour, slapstick, and wait for it.... American.

American humour (especially these days) gets derided, most often due to it being ""dumbed down"" so the collegiate set can understand it, often using toilet humour as its best punchline. I somewhat disagree, I say that the humour people use between themselves is what drives movies made by Judd Apatow & co.

Take Pineapple Express for example, this movie seems on some level to be fairly realistic. I use that term very loosely, because of course many things that happen in this film, could, and should never happen. Anyhow, the comedy, the dialogue, the fight sequences, and other interactions between the characters are the reasons I think make it feel this way.

The fight sequences aren't ones that I could say seem all that choreographed, of course there are ""X"" spots they need to hit, but for the most part I think it is done on the fly, or like much of the comedy, improvised.

Pineapple Express follows the story of a process server Dale Denton (Rogen), & his pot dealer Saul Silver (Franco), as they avoid henchmen (Robinson & Corrigan) of Ted Jones (Cole), Marijuana kingpin of L.A. after Dale witnesses a murder Ted commits. With a corrupt cop on the take (Perez) also on the hunt, staying alive for the buyer & supplier turned stoner buddies becomes an adventure of friendship as well as appreciation of the relationships built by people in this lifestyle.

The name Pineapple Express comes from the name of the variety of weed Saul introduces to Dale.

I enjoy this movie because of the old fashioned approach taken to deliver the laughs and the story, and the characters feel very relatable to almost anyone on some level.",8.0
10189,"Decent watch, probably won't watch it again, but can recommend.

I'll be upfront, while it's not really for me, I think most people will enjoy this movie, if for nothing else, then the idiot banter.

Franco's a good actor, but sometimes he and Seth put too much of themselves in the movie, and it gets worse when they're together on screen.  This basically looks like they just took what they do hanging out on a Friday sometimes and put it on screen in places, basically anytime the action dies down and they start to lean into the lull.

The first story that gets interrupted by the main plot, could easily have it's own movie, romantic comedy or drama: an older man, legitimately and legally dating a high school girl has a LOT of situations to it, and has amazing potential.  Once it gets interrupted by the ""on the lamb"" trope, I would have honestly thought it would disappear as it would in most movies, or at worst, she would show up looking for him or to get something from his place and get abducted.

The re-return to the original story line is almost funny enough itself in concept, but in actuality I just end up waiting to get back to the movie, and they do things like that throughout the entire movie.

It is conceivable when things are happening to the main characters that derail them, but when they're actively derailing themselves, then it just gets sad.  You start to question things that you shouldn't, and it's not even because they're high, as they directly have a conversation about how the weed is really bad for them, given everything that is happening.

I'm not a fan of drug humor, or abuse humor (usually), and everything that isn't that is so ridiculous that it's hard to like.

There are good jokes woven in here, but a lot of this is ""I wanted to make a movie with my  buddy while we act like idiots"", and as a fan of Kevin Smith, I respect that, but that should put you in the frame of mind that this isn't a top tier movie, and Kevin Smith writes better dialogue.",6.0

10192,"Dreamworks play safe and sign the series off with dignity.

After the monstrosity that was Shrek the Turd, the Dreamworks team behind the Shrek franchise woke up and realised what made the series so popular in the first place. Shrek Forever After is not a particularly great film, but it finds some firm footings to appease the adults and children alike.

Thematically it's as safe as houses, it pitches Shrek into a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario, where the big green ogre gets to spend a day away from the life he didn't realise he was happy with in the first place. Making a deal with the nefarious Rumpelstiltskin, Shrek finds a world of darkness for ogres, a world ruled by a psychotic who has an army of flying Margaret Hamilton's to do his bidding. Worse than that, Fiona doesn't know him, she's the leader of the resistance and has no time for some big green ogre love. Donkey is all mangy and Puss in Boots literally has become a fat cat, it's a horrible life, man!

Genius), or more crucially, it's never dull, something part 3 can't safely claim to not be.

I enjoy the bountiful humour and intriguing plot, while the newly-introduced toys are very good. If I had to nitpick, I don't massively like Lotso, who kinda feels to me like a slight copy of The Prospector from the 1999 sequel - with the difference here being he's the ultimate antagonist, perhaps too villainous for my own personal taste. As I said though, just a tiny criticism in the grand scheme of these productions.

Tom Hanks remains on top form as Woody, as do all the others including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack). Ned Beatty does a terrific job as Lotso, while Barbie and Ken are brought to life well by Jodi Benson and Michael Keaton.

Once again there are some excellent scenes, with the ending also being entertaining just like in <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>. There's also a lot of heart in the concluding scene. I'm surprised they did a fourth time, even if I do agree it's still a very good new instalment.

The script is quickly paced and witty, especially as the ""prison"" regime kicks in and the ""box"" becomes something akin to the ""cooler"" in a war film.

10195,"**A long format review from 2011**

So, Thor has only been out for a week and a half, and already it’s grossed $100 million! Pretty fucking good considering it hasn’t even been released in America yet, where like, every movie ever makes most of its money. As you may have guessed, yes, I did finally get around to seeing le Thor, hence the delay in my review of The Incredible Hulk. But know what? Fuck you man! I just watched fucking Thor!!

So in case you couldn’t guess, I was rather damn impressed with it all. Why? Well boys and girls, strap your tolerance boots on, this one could get long.

The Computer Graphics were some of the best I’ve ever seen. Now I’m not one to believe that CGI is the sort of thing that could make or break a film, but having it be this fantastic goes quite a ways to helping out. I also was unfortunate in my having to watch it in 3D, and yet it was worth it. This is a pretty big statement from me. I despise 3D… I even walked out of the cinema not feeling nauseous. A tad headache-y sure, but that was it. So congrats Thor.

The comic relief was powerful. In that “funny but not silly” kind of way. I mean, it’s all a bit silly, but it would have been so easy to fall into the cheesy trap with this film. The writing team and director Kenneth Branagh (The Boat that Rocked, Sleuth, Hamlet) did a fantastic job of keeping the audience engaged  and not descending too far into shameless, lame, self-parody.

The characters of the film were written almost as strongly as they were in Iron Man 1 & 2, not quite, but they did have quite a number more to work through, so they couldn’t work with everyone as well as they did with Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. They also managed to totally pull off an American movie with romance and comedy, in a way that totally avoided those awful American Romantic Comedies (my least favourite genre in the history of ever).

There’s this whole thing where Thor comes from another world. Which was after all really the only way you could bring a God into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has been so grounded in reality. And I’ll tell you, Asgard (Thor’s home planet) was fucking great. They pulled off this crazy similarities in appearance between family members on Asgard, despite the fact that none of the actors are related. You may disagree with me on inspection of posters and whatnot, but after seeing the movie, you’ll get what I mean. Also the actors they got to play the younger Loki and Thor were eerily believable. Like, to an actually kind of scary point. I wonder if any of it was fake… The Frost Giant homeworld of Jotunheim is also visually stunning.

The sound effects were very confronting. I couldn’t really figure out if I though this was a good or a bad thing… It’ll be interesting to rewatch on DVD, and see if it was only so crazy because of the speakers in the theatre. Thor may have lacked the wholeness as a film felt by Iron Man 1 & 2, or The Incredible Hulk, but it was perfect as a lead up to The Avengers, which, now that it’s all set in stone, is really kind of needed. With Thor more than the other heroes it’s the most important, because there was really no way to humanise that sort of character, he’s just so outlandish that you really need an entire film just to ground him in this world they’re developing.

But all of the things I’ve had to say about the film were basically leading up to this one big thing; the cast! The cast was incredible, not only did they manage to snag a total of THREE of my favourite underrated actors ever, one of them just so happened to my favourite actor in the whole wide world, Ray Stevenson!

We have Australian (fuck yes Australia!) Chris Hemsworth (Home and Away [Hey! We all have to start somewhere, right?], A Perfect Getaway, Ca$h, Cabin in the Woods) playing Thor, Natalie Portman (Black Swan, V For Vendetta) playing Thor’s love interest; Jane Foster (lots of people have started having a problem with Natalie Portman nowadays, but I still love her), Anthony Hopkins (The Rite, The Wolfman, Beowulf, Red Dragon, Hannibal, The Silence of the Lambs [Yes, this is the same guy who played Hannibal Lecter. I fucking know, right!?] Bram Stroker’s Dracula) as Thor’s father; Odin, Stellan Skarsgard (King Arthur, Exorcist: The Beginning, Beowulf & Grendel, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Angels & Demons) as Dr. Erik Selvig; Jane Foster’s mentor, Ray Stevenson (Rome, King Arthur, Outpost, Punisher: War Zone, The Book of Eli) as Thor’s friend, and member of the Warriors Three (above); Volstagg, Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T., The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, 28 Weeks Later, The Hurt Locker, The Town) as Hawkeye; the S.H.I.E.L.D. sharpshooter, and Samuel L. Jackson (The Exorcist III, Jurassic Park, Jackie Brown, Shaft, Pulp Fiction, the Star Wars prequel trilogy, S.W.A.T., Snakes on a Plane, 1408,  Cleaner, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds) as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director; General Nick Fury… And those are just the actors I already adore.

I’ve now also grown quite attached to Tom Hiddleston (Wallander) who plays Loki, Thor’s brother, and the main antagonist, as well as Joshua Dallas (Doctor Who and The Descent Part II) who plays another of the Warriors Three (above), and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist and Defendor) who plays D’arcy Lewis; Jane Foster’s friend and colleague.

As I always like to say, I watched this film in a theatre (Belcompton, shit, uh, Belconnen, Hoyts to be specific). I really think this film has lasting value, but it’s important to note that I almost always feel a film is enhanced when watched on the big screen, especially with Action films, effects films, epic films and franchise films. Thor happens to be all of those things. I was especially excited waiting for the post-credits scene to come up in that huge cinema. So please take into consideration that I reviewed this on the silver screen, if you happen to be watching it on DVD or BluRay or some such. Because you better of not fucking downloaded it!!  Damn scum…

10195,"Coming as it does from easily the most interesting of the mythological Pantheons explored by Marvel, this is my favourite from their catalogue. Sir Anthony Hopkins (""Odin"") presides over Asgard with his sons ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) and ""Loki"" (Tom Hiddleston). The former is a bit wayward, but has his heart in the right place; the latter is a bit of a devious schemer whose machinations cause his elder brother to be cast into ""Midgard"" (where we live, basically). It is there - devoid of his strength and his famous hammer (Mjölnir) that he alights on a team of scientists led by the eccentric ""Selvig"" (Stellan Skarsgård) and ""Jane"" (Natalie Portman) and sets about regaining his power and returning home before his brother wrecks everything... I was surprised to read that Sir Kenneth Branagh was going to direct this - but he actually does a thorough job. The film is full of action, is well paced and both Hemsworth and Hiddleston have enough depth to their characters to keep this from just becoming another good looking fight-fest. The story is darker, there is more of a sense of menace throughout too - and that reflects the more mature approach taken by the director to give us an adventure film with just a bit more substance to it. The script has humour, especially for Skarsgård and Hemsworth and Sir Anthony has a sagely imperiousness to hold the threads together before a strong conclusion with just the tiniest hint of romance.

10197,"***A famous director loses his inspiration and seeks aid from the various women in his life*** 

Released in 2009, “Nine” is a drama/musical about a famous Italian director in 1965 (Daniel Day-Lewis) who loses his inspiration, but its urgent he gets it back because his ninth movie is set to start shooting in ten days and he doesn’t even have a script. He turns to the several women in his life for succor: his wife (Marion Cotillard), his mistress (Penélope Cruz), his costume designer (Judi Dench), his star actress (Nicole Kidman), his mother (Sophia Loren), a fashion journalist (Kate Hudson) and a prostitute from his boyhood (Fergie).

This is an adaptation of the 1982 Broadway musical, also dubbed “Nine,” which itself was based on Federico Fellini's semi-autobiographical 1963 film “8½.” It’s very similar to director Rob Marshall’s “Chicago” (2002), but with a different story, cast and location (Rome and points nearby).

During the first half I wasn’t so sure about the story, but I eventually found myself absorbed into the life of the tormented director and his mid-life crisis. His unfaithfulness to his beautiful wife, Luisa (Cotillard), is off-putting of course, but maybe we should have mercy for a man who has scores of gorgeous women offering themselves to him practically every day. It helps that he WANTS to be free from his adulteries and be true to Luisa.

Yet I have a hard time picturing Guido (Day-Lewis) seeking the amorous attentions of Carla (Cruz) above Luisa. Carla is decent, as far as all-around physical beauty goes, but Luisa has better curves. Both of the characters’ have imaginative dance sequences, but Luisa comes out on top even though her routine is less tantalizing.

Day-Lewis is fascinating as the guilt-stricken director who hasn’t let his fame go to his head. When he asks a cleric for advice about God and his troubles, the vicar responds: “Imagination is God’s garden, don’t let the devil play in it.”

I generally don’t favor musicals where the characters suddenly jump into song & dance while walking at the park or eating dinner. My wife & I sometimes poke fun of these kinds of musicals by mimicking them while doing mundane activities. For me, musicals only work, generally speaking, when the singing/dancing sequences are legitimate, like a performance at a nightclub or one's imagination, both of which were used in ""Chicago."" Of course it’s more challenging and takes more creativity to incorporate song & dance routines in this manner and keep the movie seamless & realistic. “Nine” does this.

Anika Noni Rose works well in the lead role as Tiana, while it's pleasant to hear John Goodman as Big Daddy; albeit not as a major character. Keith David (Shadow Man) and Oprah Winfrey (Eudora), meanwhile, are welcomed cast members.

The music is rather forgettable, though the (traditional) animation is nice. There's a few moments where it drags its heels slightly, but the pacing is mostly fine. It all comes down to whether you enjoy princess stories, given how predictable and formulaic they are. I'm nonplussed about them, to be honest.

10198,"When the eligible bachelor ""Prince Naveen"" arrives in New Orleans, he suffers quite a character change! It seems that the evil ""Facilier"" - straight out of ""Live and Let Die"" (1973) - has offered his butler the chance to swap places with his master, and his master is now a little green frog. As everyone knows, only true love's kiss can reverse the impact of a curse like this and so it falls to aspiring waitress ""Tiana"" to firstly be convinced that this talking amphibian is actually worth kissing, then when that tried and tested solution merely converts her into another green frog, they must both enlist the help of a trumpeter alligator and an enthusiastic and brave firefly to head into the deepest part of the bayou where an old blind witch might have the solution to defeat this blackest of voodoo magic. Thing is, though - the clock is ticking and the evil ""Faciler"" has enlisted his allies from the underworld to ensure that their predicament becomes permanent! This is a really jolly and characterful family adventure with some splendid and detailed animation and a fun score from Randy Newman that frequently gets the toes tapping. I could have been doing with a bit more of the nasty ""Facilier"" but I suppose Disney don't like too much of the baddie featuring in their movies - which is a shame as they are almost always the best! I saw this recently again on a big screen and it has much more of the traditional cartoon elements to it than many of the others made by this studio in the noughties.

10200,"***Intriguing, Spiritual, Insightful, Moving***

""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (2008) is an intriguing, powerful and even moving modern sci-fi blockbuster. I particularly like the symbolism: Klaatu=Christ, GORT=YaHWeH, as well as the numerous biblical references: Noah's Ark, the death plague, human beings trying to put God in a box literally, the sacrificial nature of agape love, etc. In other words, the film tackles subjects of great depth that every human being can relate to whatever their belief system. This itself separates it from the usual idiotic blockbuster fare.

Now let me address some common criticisms (please see the film first before reading further due to **SPOILERS**): 

The kid is initially quite annoying but this is understandable as he's an archetype for what humankind is: an annoying, untrusting, simpleminded child-race. His sudden change into ""maturity"" represents how humanity needs to ""grow-up."" This helps make sense of the kid's repeated statements about killing Klaatu, which were magnified by the media's slander of Klaatu as a dangerous escaped convict. Klaatu's strange actions helped feed this negative mindset. As for the kid's dead father, the boy was only 9 years old and understood his father to be a soldier. Why wouldn't he have a mythical impression that he killed 'bad guys' for a living, likely with his bare hands? 

The judgment of mass human destruction was already set for the earth after hundreds of years of observation, including an Asian scout who lived with humans for 70 years. Klaatu was sent to activate the judgment UNLESS he observed some clear indication that the harsh judgment wasn't necessary yet. Klaatu didn't change the original plan UNTIL very late in the story, which is why he stated to Helen that he wasn't sure if he could overturn it. Although Klaatu was the primary agent, he wasn’t necessarily alone. Gort was there and he was only partially robotic, as well as Mr. Wu. There were probably hundreds/thousands of other aliens involved in one way or another.

The military attacks because their modus operandi is to defend the nation, which was augmented by the destructive nature of humanity in general. 

When Bate's character finally decides to send Helen out to talk with Klaatu she was the government’s proverbial last hope. All other governmental attempts to prevent the judgment failed abysmally up to this point, not to mention the judgment of mass destruction was ALREADY well into motion. Other national leaders were concerned with saving their own.

The biggest sphere was the central command orb. Klaatu didn't possess the power to stop the swarm himself; he had to get to the central orb to attempt to stop the mass destruction. Even then, he wasn't sure if he could do it. In fact, it cost him dearly.

The alien swarm only destroyed humanity and all human imprints (like the stadium, the the installation and the semi); I saw no evidence of the swarms destroying trees or animal life. The animal ark-orbs were obviously precautionary in nature; in other words, the aliens knew there would be collateral damage due to the nature of the swarms so they snatched away all manner of animal life as a precaution.

Klaatu made it quite clear what he was doing: saving the earth by destroying humanity and their intrinsic bent toward destruction. The way he put it was: If humanity lives the earth will die, but if humanity dies the earth will live.

The Aliens are powerful, but it's inaccurate to call them careless. They monitored the planet for centuries and their decision was carefully decided.

To write-off humanity's destructive bent as ""minor-league carelessness"" is shallow and un-enlightened, as well as wholly inaccurate.

The aliens' actions had nothing to do with ""might makes right"" but everything to do with saving a planet from the infection that would wholly destroy it (people) if they failed to act. Their celestial judgment was that the cancer HAD to be cut out and time was of the essence.

Really, the only ""detestable characters"" are the government as a whole, which is displayed as a cold machine. Helen (Jennifer Connelly) is a character of beauty, reverence and wisdom while the professor plays humanity's wise intercessor. Kathy Bates' character is unlikable because she represents the government and comes off as an arrogant machine-like biyatch. After she's completely humbled, however, she changes her tune. Meanwhile the kid is only 9 years old and lost both of his biological parents; cut him some slack. Besides, he also changes his tune and Klaatu takes on the role of his spiritual father. How can you NOT feel for Jacob when he falls on his face at his dad's grave? 

So none of the common gripes hold water. The insane bashing of the film is simply the result of an unjust critical feeding frenzy. If people would disregard the monkey-see-monkey-do panning and view the film with an open mind they might actually enjoy it and possibly discover something worthwhile.

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes.

Swanson plays her part for all that it's worth; I certainly couldn't fault her enthusiasm and Perry was an handsome man and provides an extra degree of slightly comedic eye-candy in what is otherwise a throwaway television movie that is probably only ever going to be remembered for spawning the television series five years later. I didn't hate it, I have to say. It reminded me of the whole ""Beverly Hills 90210"" fever that hit the UK at the start of the 1990s, and taken in the context of a light-hearted teen flick with little or no scare, gore, or horror is just about watchable.",5.0
10207,"_**Enjoyable, but contrived, love story with some very puzzling questions**_

While on vacation in the Northeast a researcher for the Chicago Tribune (Robin Wright Penn) finds a romantic message in a bottle that is truly moving. After her editor prints the letter it becomes a hit and she travels to North Carolina to find the man who wrote the message (Keven Costner). Paul Newman is on hand as the latter’s father while John Savage plays his angry brother-in-law. 

""Message in a Bottle"" (1999) is an entertaining drama/romance with quality actors and East Coast locations. Unfortunately, parts of the contrived plot are too much of a stretch and some seriously perplexing questions are raised that I can’t detail without spoiling the movie for first-time viewers. Write me and I’ll share them with you.

Thankfully, there’s too much good to write the movie off as worthless. For instance, there’s a well-done subplot that has to do with manly antagonism and reconciliation. The average male has too much machismo to voice sappy apologies, but they clearly apologize & reconcile in less direct ways. Just read between the lines.

When Theresa asks Garrett, ""Will you come and visit me,'' Roger Ebert complained about the (supposed) lousy writing of the latter’s response: ""You mean, inland?'' I guess he failed to notice that Garrett had a smirk on his face and was playing with Theresa wherein she giggled.

Some people complain that the film was shot in Maine while the story takes place in The Outer Banks, North Carolina, which looks nothing like Maine and insults the intelligence of the viewer. In the producers’ defense, they tried to shoot in a couple places further south, but couldn’t get permits and so had to settle for Maine (Bath, New Harbor, Phippsburg & Portland). Yet the coastal scenery isn’t much of a focus, so it’s not that big of a deal. If it really bugs you, just imagine that Garrett throws the bottles into the ocean in Maine and Theresa finds the initial message while vacationing in Nova Scotia; problem solved.   

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes, and was shot in Maine and Chicago, plus some stuff done at Falls Lake, Backlot, Universal Studios, Southern Cal.

10210,"This is my favourite Shakespeare story, full of mischief and mayhem, comedy and even a good bit of lust mixed in with the true love. This, however, is a really pedestrian adaptation that doesn't measure (for measure) up at all. The all important character of ""Puck"" is really quite underplayed by Stanley Tucci and Kevin Klein's ""Bottom"" comes across better suited for a pantomime performance of this tale of the ultimate love triangle. If you don't know the story: ""Hermia"" (Anna Friel) is in love with ""Lysander"" (Dominic West) but her father (Bernard Hill) wants her to marry ""Demetrius"" (Christian Bale). In the end they have to go before the Duke (David Strathairn) who says either marry as you're bid or prepare to die! Bent on escaping, they all end up in the forest and under a magical spell from ""Puck"" that throws all of their order into chaos and leaves us with some colourful and entertaining scenarios as the poor old Duke attends to his own impending nuptials whilst unsure of who actually loves whom! The problem with the casting here is that they all seem a little overwhelmed by the language. It does stick to the traditional dialogue, and I couldn't help but wonder if maybe the stars were just too in awe of what they were acting and so nothing really comes across as very natural or engaging to watch. It looks good, there is a fine score mixing the classical with a Simon Boswell original but sadly the comedy doesn't work so well and the whole thing underperforms this magical and whimsical story. Nothing special here, sorry.",6.0
10214,"Just as awful as I had anticipated. With that said, it's nothing so bad that it offended me - it's simply totally and utterly bad, to the point I kinda find it hard to hate on it because I just don't have any thoughts on it. It is, without question, undoubtedly worse than 1994's <em>'The Mask'</em> in every conceivable way though.

Jamie Kennedy's version of this Dark Horse Comics character is truly dreadful, especially visually, though thankfully the film doesn't actually give that much air time to Kennedy as The Mask; like, he's there but it's predominantly the dog and the son that get much of the screen time alongside Alan Cumming's Loki - to slightly better effect too, the way the kid is animated kinda nearly works... it doesn't, but almost.

Ryan Reynolds, <a href=""https://youtu.be/X4ctYxLoXdo?t=406"" rel=""nofollow"">according</a> to Kennedy himself, possibly wanted this role. It's lucky Reynolds didn't get his way, or he'd be stuck with a green ghoul in his past. <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/green-lantern/"" rel=""nofollow"">Oh, wait!</a>

10214,"**A film made to make money off the success of its predecessor, but which has nothing to do with it.**

Anyone who saw the movie “The Mask” with Jim Carey, from 1994, cannot remain indifferent. It's one of those family comedies that marked the 90's and that strongly contributed to the meteoric rise of the comic actor's career. It was a film that, in my opinion, did not need a sequel, but that, if it came to exist, would have to have the same crew and a similar cast (that is, keeping, at least, Carey and some other actors). Unfortunately, this movie does everything it shouldn't have done.

In fact, any comparison between the first movie and this crap is pointless. It is not the first time that I see that there are sequels made to profit from great successes and that have virtually no connection with the preceding films. This is just one more example. Jim Carey was right not to want to associate himself with a project that failed at the outset, not least because most of the cast that associated with the film did not manage to take advantage of it beyond the financial inflow.

The film is clearly expensive and stupid. It had a high budget, which was invested in a range of CGI assets and massive and sometimes impressive visual effects, but everything else is lacking. And the film's biggest flaw couldn't be any other: the script is so amateurish and idiotic that it seems to have been written by ten-year-old children. Ideas are bad, there are a number of situations in which we feel that the public is being mocked, and our intelligence is being mocked too.

Another problem with this film is the total lack of humor. The movie was supposed to be funny and make us laugh, but we couldn't find anything funny. Much of what is shown was already done – and better – in the first film, and what has been introduced as new is a series of scatological or gross jokes that, I think, could have been cut. Even children's audiences might not be very interested in seeing this, if you think about it.

The cast does what they can, but they can't do much. Deep down, the actors end up being the least to blame for the fact that the film is rubbish. Alan Cumming turns out to be the best actor present and is the only one worth seeing work. He's an effective villain and his comedic streak is interesting, but totally wasted here. Bob Hoskins makes an appearance, but it is innocuous and adds nothing to the film. Jamie Kennedy is bad, he does a bad job, and surely he must be sorry he got into this movie. The rest is basically a bunch of extras, even when they have to talk.",1.0

Now unlike with the first of these not-so-classic sci-fi films, this time it's the man who needs to breed and boy does he have a go. No woman is safe - but none of them are ""Eve"" (Natasha Henstridge). She is the woman of his dreams but is secure in a facility managed by ""Laura"" (Marg Helgenberger).

10218,"**A film about characters and dialogue, made by men and for (some) men.**

Watching films with a lot of dialogue allows us, sometimes, to find some very good works in terms of the construction of lines and development of characters. In these films, these elements become the essence that justifies their existence. And we can think of several examples, such as “Before Sunrise”. This film isn't bad either, but it targets a niche audience that I don't find myself in: single men, somewhat bitter and dissatisfied, misogynists and womanizers. I am single, and I feel peacefully satisfied, without a hint of misogyny and never closing doors to love, but also without any despair. And in fact, I haven't set foot in a bar since my college days. As you can see, I'm not the kind of man who could identify with these characters.

The plot revolves around three friends, aspiring actors, who seek to make it in challenging Los Angeles. One of them is depressed due to the end of a long-term relationship, and the other two friends decide to take him to bars, to drink and flirt as much as possible. From drink to drink, from one flirtation to another, the conversation between the various characters reveal a lot about themselves, and the way they see the world. It's not a narrative film, it doesn't have a very solid story, but it has good characters and an excellent collection of dialogues.

Directed by Doug Liman, the film has simple, but effective and credible cinematography, sets and costumes. Being an independent film, made outside the multimillion-dollar studios, the production had several budget problems that forced practical and functional choices. This may have been positive, allowing for greater verisimilitude and the choice of realistic locations and situations. Being a film so focused on the male mentality, and a world of bars and flirting, it is likely that the female audience would prefer to see something else.

Screenwriter and actor John Favreau plays the main character, supported by two longtime friends, Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone. Each of them does a good job and explores their character very well, expressing a lot of themselves, which turns these characters into “alter egos” of the actors who play them. This is unusual in cinema, but not unheard of. The film also features the participation of other actors and friends of those involved, in smaller and less well-crafted characters.",6.0

Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane, who after witnessing his brother getting crippled in a Muay Thai fight in Thailand, sets about learning the art himself so as to enact revenge on the sinister Tiger Tong Po who illegally put his brother in the wheel chair.

Ah look, I don't see any point in writing about the market that Van Damme movies sit in, I think everyone knows that there isn't going to be great acting in these movies, the plotting will be straight and simple and the resolution will be prescribed to get a whoop and yee-haw response. I would think that as much as some highbrow film fans roll their eyes and look down their noses at these type of action movies, they do at least acknowledge the fighting artistry and choreography on show. They, you hope, stay away and leave the ass kicking fans and nostalgists to wallow in their cheese and beaten body pulp kingdoms. I mean why would an arty film lover seek out an early Van Damme movie anyway?

I love Kickboxer, I really do, when I first caught it on release I could be found trying to do some of those wonderful Van Damme moves, rewatching the key moments over and over again, enjoying immensely the adrenalin rush that comes as we go slow-mo and Jean-Claude goes about dismantling uber bastard villain Tiger Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Now, well over twenty years later, I still get that rush, I can't do the moves, mind, I nearly put my shoulder out just punching the air in triumph as a mullet headed Dennis Alexio sticks his thumb up from his wheelchair, but all the thrills are still there, the skills on show still amazing. Hell, there's even a pet thread of substance, damn those animal threads, that cool dog better not get killed! Grrrrrrrr.

Of course now, viewing with older and wiser eyes, you can see the clunkiness of the script, the lame-brained plotting and excuses for Van Damme to flash the flesh and show his dexterity. There's even one of the worst dance sequences ever put down on film, so bad I can't believe I never laughed out loud at the cinema all those years ago. Yet it's still a wonderful movie, often exhilarating, the thematics of second chances (Haskell V. Anderson III having a great old time of it as Winston Taylor), revenge and different cultures, these impact greatly on the picture. Then there's Dennis Chan as Xian Chow, giving Pat Morita a run for his money as the most fun cinematic Martial Arts trainer, the real location photography in Thailand, the training sequences and of course we get to learn about the ancient sport of Muay Thai. There's a lot of good here to off set the saggy cheese.

There are some truly awful Van Damme movies out there, case in point Cyborg which was released the same year as Kickboxer, and without doubt the quality of Van Damme movies improved in the 90s as his stock began to rise and the budgets went higher. But this is a goody for his fans to lap up, a film to sit alongside Bloodsport as one of the two best action movies from his early body of work. And I love it so. 8/10",8.0
10223,"Do you ever feel evil?

A Simple Plan is directed by Sam Raimi and adapted to screenplay by Scott Smith from his own novel of the same name. It stars Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda, Brent Briscoe, Chelcie Ross and Jack Walsh. Music is by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Alar Kivilo.

The snowy wilds of Midwest America, and two brothers and one friend unearth a crashed plane in the snow that hosts one dead pilot and a duffel bag with over $4 million dollars stashed inside. It's moral quandary time. Keep the money as it's probably drug money anyway, tell the police, or sit on it and wait to see what happens? A decision is made, and it literally turns everyone's life upside down...

Scott B. Smith's novel was perfect for a filmic adaptation, in essence it's classic noir with its small town Americanna setting that houses a moral twist of fate that ultimately sees the town implode from within. How refreshing to find the author adapting his own source material, and not only that, to find that it has also gotten a grade ""A"" production from Raimi and his team.

The story is in all truth simple, it asks the characters, and us, what to do when finding so much cash? Fate meant they found it and fate then dealt its moral card, from the point the decision is made, nothing will ever be the same. The tale spins the three male characters, and one pregnant wife, into a vortex of bad decision making and misery. Enter paranoia, greed, murder, panic and a whole host of other bad things to upset the equilibrium that once dominated their mundane, but safe, lives. 

Director Raimi, who apparently received coaching from his pals Joel and Ethan Coen about how best to work in the snow (the Fargo likeness is well noted by critics), ensures the coldness of the landscape dovetails perfectly with the untangling world of the protagonists. With the frost bitten locale acting as the extra character, and as an accomplice as it happens, Raimi slots in memorable imagery to tickle away at the senses. Animals figure most darkly, with crows and a fox in the hen house beautifully endorsing the themes of decay and the need to kill to survive. While the pacing is sublime, Raimi using a slow dripping tap method that tightens the screws until violence jolts the story, and us, to the precipice.

As a character piece it's superbly mounted, where Raimi is indebted to a four pronged delivery of acting performances of some substance. Thornton was rightly lauded for his turn as the slower brother to Paxton's (excellent) all American nice guy, but Briscoe as the ""town drunk"" best friend and Fonda as the inverted femme fatale wife, also deserve great praise for realisation of characters that bring this Shakespearean neo-noir to vivid life. 

Elswhere the tech credits are thematically notable. Kivilo's photography is in sync with Raimi's ideals about the snowy backdrop playing a key part, and Elfman's score, while not something to interest potential newcomers to his work, works very well as blunderbuss percussion is replaced by appropriate woodwind that flits about the wooded surrounds with foreboding glee.

At the end of the day it comes down to quality of story telling, in that regard A Simple Plan is a first class production. If you haven't seen the film or read the novel, then I certainly would recommend the novel to read first as there are inevitable tone downs in the movie. But that is not detrimental to the film's worth, for the visual version of Smith's novel is engrossing, chilling and poignantly bleak. And away from his Indies, it's still Raimi's most accomplished film so far, and he really should consider doing more neo-noir in the future. 9/10",9.0
10223,"***Bleak crime drama in the wintery Minnesota woods***

Two brothers & a friend from a small town in Minnesota (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Brent Briscoe) happen upon a crashed plane in the woods, which contains over $4 million in cash. They assume it’s drug money and hatch a simple plan to sit on the money until spring when the plane is discovered; if no one legitimately claims it they’ll divvy it up. But things don’t go according to plan due to idiocy, mistrust and greed. Bridget Fonda is on hand as the main protagonist’s wife.

Directed by Sam Raimi before his ultra-success with the Spider-Man trilogy, ""A Simple Plan” (1998) was written by Scott B. Smith based on his page-turning book of the same name (there are enough changes to make both worthwhile). The wintery Minnesota setting is fitting for the bleak psychological drama. Speaking of which, the best thing about this movie is its exploration of human nature and how “the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil,” as the Bible puts it.

The movie effectively shows how basically good and normal people can be corrupted by the temptation of easy wealth; so corrupted that he or she is suddenly willing to murder, lie and connive. The story works so well because of the three well-defined characters. We’ve all met these types in real life: The wholesome, educated man who’s not quite living up to his potential and yet is generally satisfied; the loser, screw-up who’s never been with a girl even though he’s in his 40s; and the annoying redneck hick.

The pilot's corpse is still at the controls but they are more interested in the contents of a sports bag. It's got over $4m in it! What to do? Hand it in? Put it back? Keep it? Well the whole story is set against a backdrop of a less attractive American dream with a paucity of opportunity for any of these men. ""Hank"" will soon be a father and ""Jacob"" is determined to reclaim a family farm that was foreclosed upon years earlier. Decision made! Initially they are organised and disciplined. No splashing the cash, taking things responsibly and keeping under the radar - but gradually that disciple starts to crack. Not least because the expecting ""Sarah"" (Bridget Fonda) is conceivably even more determined to use the cash than the men who found it. Pressures begin to build, trusts begin to fray and some newspaper clippings inform them a little more of the likely source of their windfall. With the arrival of the FBI - well things turn sour on just about every level. It's Thornton who takes the plaudits here with an understated effort as probably the most principled of the men but all three work well together, with the increasingly Fonda stoking the fire, and though maybe just a little drastically far-fetched towards the end, this is quite a telling story of just what people might be prepared to do to better their lot. It's setting amidst the cold and darkness coupled with a rather benign small-town mentality (especially amongst local law enforcement) serves the scenario effectively as a sleepy town where nothing much ever happens starts to resemble something from an horror film.

An absolute hoot of a addition to the Friday 13th franchise. As is often the way with the ""Friday"" sequels, you can talk to one horror fan and this is the worst of the bunch, talk to another and it's the best etc etc. There's a more airy touch here and it serves the formula well, which if the series' fans are honest, is a formula that was getting stale quite early in the chain, so any sort of new ideas or direction is most welcome. 

After a glorious James Bond parody opens the credits sequence, accompanied by Harry Manfredini's superbly thunderous musical score, we get long running tormented character Tommy, here played by Thom Matthews, digging up Jason Voorhees' corpse so as to make sure the evil one is dead - oh and to kill him again. Enter a glorious Frankenstein homage (cheeky steal if you like) that sets us up for another round of stalk and dismember as Jason heads back to Camp Crystal Lake, which is now called Camp Forest Green!

The kills are not particularly inventive, but there's a real thud of humour about much of them. From an American Express Card to a bloody smiley face imprint, it's clear the makers have a glint in their eyes. We even get an early appearance from Tony Goldwyn, some four years before Ghost would make him a known name. Adding to the quality score, which BTW rattles around home cinema speakers lie a supernatural entity, is Jon Kranhouse's cinematography, which is gorgeous in colour lens selections. All that and you get an Alice Cooper soundtrack as well.

10225,"***Jason lives again as a horrific zombie, plus Megan (Jennifer Cooke)***

Released in 1986, ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" is notable for being the premiere of the zombie Jason as his rotting corpse is resurrected in the prologue indirectly through the actions of Tommy Jarvis and a friend who recently got out of a mental institution. This prologue also shows that Tommy didn't murder Pam at the end of Part V and that he was simply experiencing hallucinations from his trauma with the diabolic Voorhees spirit. Another difference with Part VI is that we finally get to see a busload of kids, children, at Crystal Lake, although they changed the name to Forest Green. Tommy runs to the local police to inform them that Jason has been resurrected but the sheriff, of course, doesn't believe him (would you?). His hot daughter, Megan, is attracted to Tommy and, when the bloody body count rises, the sheriff realizes that Jason is indeed alive.

Tommy Jarvis is played by Thom Mathews rather than John Shepherd, who was excellent in Part V. Thom is a worthy replacement, but I prefer Shepherd's brooding charisma.

The film features one of the best Friday girls in Megan, played by Jennifer Cooke, although Pam from the previous film is my favorite. Other than that, though, the females in Part VI are rather weak, although the redhead in the Volkswagen is notable (Nancy McLoughlin). 

The campiness of Part III and Part V returns for this installment, particularly with the goofy paintball warriors and the graveyard caretaker. But “Jason Lives” is noticeably superior to Part III and shares the kinetic vibe of Part V.

As far as locations go, Part VI returns to the East for filming, being shot roughly 40 miles East of Atlanta in Covington & Rutledge .

BOTTOM LINE: You either like the Friday the 13th series or you don't. Part VI is another retread of the same Friday formula with the entertaining spirit of Part V and the distinction of Jason now being totally inhuman, a horrific zombie; not to mention the addition of children at the camp. It also has a better story than parts III and IV with the sheriff and his daughter & Tommy going after Jason, plus Megan is one of the top Friday girls in the series. 

The film runs 91 minutes and the cut version 86 minutes.

Went full on with the cheese which makes sense since Jason is brought back to life through the dumb ass decision by Tommy Jarvis to not only dig up the grave but stabbing the corpse with an iron post, he was just asking for trouble (and running into the sheriff's office yelling like a psycho didn't help). I did like the female lead but everyone else, including Thom Matthews, was a bit bland. **2.75/5**",6.0

Personally, this movie ranks among my top 25 films of all time. While there may be some plot holes and issues that some viewers may not appreciate, the music is outstanding and the storyline itself is intriguing.

10236,"***A radical Left-winger falls in love with a more conservative WASP on the verge of WW2 and post-war*** 

A disparate couple meets in college in 1937, New York, and then reignite after the war. Katie (Barbra Streisand) is an uber-Liberal while Hubbell (Robert Redford) is more levelheaded about politics. He becomes a writer in Hollywood during the blacklist investigations of the late 40s wherein Katie’s activism threatens his social life and career. The story closes in 1957.

“The Way We Were” (1973) is a classic drama/romance, much acclaimed in its day. The vibe is similar to “Love Story” (1970) but this has superior characters and a more interesting setting.  

It’s interesting to see how loony Liberals existed way back then in the 30s-40s. The movie works because it wisely makes Katie three-dimensional. Sure, she’s a typical INtolerant, obnoxious Leftie, but she also has a human side, a warm and humble side. Meanwhile Redford is at the top of his game here. Streisand incidentally developed a crush on Redford during shooting, but didn’t share her feelings. He feigned ignorance and used Barbra’s infatuation for the benefit of the movie.

There has been some confusion about the last act. Pay attention to what Hubbell says. What happens has nothing to do with Carol Ann and everything to do with the obvious.    

The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in Union College in Schenectady, New York; Ballston Spa in upstate New York; New York City; Malibu; and nearby Union Station in Los Angeles. The peripheral cast includes Bradford Dillman, Lois Chiles and James Woods.

10238,"Though my personal favourite of Bergman's films will always be the first I've seen, for sentimental reasons ('Through a Glass Darkly'), this is outstanding. Essential for all cinephiles. A masterclass of acting, directing and cinematography. A dish to be savoured, exquisitely.",10.0
10238,"Ingmar Bergman's 1972 film <i>Viskningar och rop</i> (Cries and Whispers) was one of the auteur's major achievements of that decade. In a Swedish country house, the dying Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is visited by her two sisters, the sensual and impulsive Karin (Liv Ullmann), and the stern and frigid Maria (Ingrid Thulin). Though ostensibly there to comfort Agnes in her last days, they are essentially just waiting for her to die, as they are too more preoccupied with their unhappy marriages, their mysterious personal feud, and the specifics of dividing up the estate. It falls to Agnes' devoted maid Anna (Kari Sylwan) to provide any human warmth. One of the most emotionally touching aspects of the film is this contrast between the selfless love of a member of a despised underclass and the indifference (or outright disgust) expressed by Agnes' own family.

Bergman had made the transition to colour film with <i>En Pasion</i> of three years earlier, but <i>Viskningar och rop</i> finally exploits its possibilities. Red is ever present on screen, whether in the red wing of the house in which Agnes lies dying, the red transitions between scenes, or the vivid blood that flows in each of the sisters' flashbacks to the decay of their marriages. Sven Nykvist's cinematography is, as always, brilliant. And though one doesn't often think of the makeup artist in a Bergman film, whoever worked on this one deserves praise for making such a glamorous actress as Harriet Andersson (still in her late 30s then and quite glamorous) look convincingly decrepit.

Bergman considered <i>Viskningar och rop</i> one of his two greatest films, along with 1966's <i>Persona</i>. I must say, however, that I have never ranked it so highly. While <i>Viskningar och rop</i> continues to amaze me on every viewing, <i>Viskningar och rop</i> does tend to exhaust its overt symbolism and interpersonal dynamics right away, and I rarely come back to it. Furthermore, I feel Bergman wove too much of this film out of what had become stock gestures for him, such as incestuous siblings, and a man speaking about the need to trust God when he himself has lost faith.",7.0
10238,"There are certainly some very strong performances in this rather downbeat drama from Ingmar Bergman. ""Agnes"" (Harriet Andersson) is bed-ridden, dying of cancer and being tended by her two sisters ""Karin"" (Ingrid Thulin); ""Maria"" (Liv Ullmann) alongside their maid ""Anna"" (Kari Sylwan). The two sisters are pretty taciturn with each other; neither have particularly happy nor fulfilling marriages and the film uses the decline of ""Agnes"" as a conduit to reflect on their past lives, loves and on their own relationships. Thulin is particularly effective here, but the undercurrents of resentment between the siblings and their spouses (and the doctor Erland Josephson) are presented with a bleakness that I found all rather sterile. Watching their strife, I could not say that I was immersed with any feeling of involvement in their scenarios. Certainly the acting is penetrative, the intimate (though sometimes quite clunky) moving photography adds richness to the performances; but I found the story to be devoid of much humanity. Bluntly, I just didn't really care for any but the dedicated servant ""Anna"", who quite possibly loved ""Agnes"" more than the others put together. The last ten minutes are surreal - and they do finally put some bones onto this story, but until then I struggled with this rather angst-ridden tale of middle-class foibles and values. Maybe when it was made 50 years ago, it had potency. Not so much now.",6.0
10242,"Now then, settle down - turn off the phone, grab some Malbec and be prepared for one of the finest examples of character-driven cinema you are ever likely to encounter. Bette Davis is the former, rather petulant, child star ""Baby Jane"" who rather grudgingly looks after her sister - the more critically acclaimed actress ""Blanche"" (Joan Crawford) as their dotage approaches in their Hollywood home. ""Blanche"" is largely confined to a wheelchair, so is entirely dependent on her increasingly alcoholic, flaky and downright nasty sibling. Thing is, though, it's Blanche who has the money - and when she starts to discuss selling their house this riles her sister who soon has some pretty menacing thoughts about thwarting this ""betrayal"". Luckily for ""Blanche"" - their maid ""Elvira"" (Maidie Norman) starts to become aware of this rather menacing change in attitude, and well... Crawford and Davis are very much at the top of their games here, and somehow you can't help but wonder if they were really acting their socks off, or whether there was a serious bit of professional ""loathing"" going on on the set of this deftly directed Robert Aldrich classic. There is a positive sense of venom here from Davis, and her counterpart portrays the traumatised victim with great aplomb. Neither woman is afraid to ditch their more traditional glamour. Davis looks truly demented in her part as the woman with one hand on the bottle and the other on the door handle of the sanatorium - and she excels in the part. It's almost 2¼ hours long and it positively flies by. The pace is perfect, the DeVol score ebbs and flows with the frequently pithy and powerful dialogue and the photography - often tight and intimate makes this a superb example of the ultimate cinema sibling rivalry. Big screen if you can - but either way, this is just about as good as it gets.",8.0

It perhaps, on the surface, doesn't sound much does it? We as viewers are asked to spend over two hours watching these men interact with each other with differing results. The location stays the same, it is just sand, sun, and men awaiting death. Yet the film is one of the best exponents of the character piece because the characters each have their own personal hang ups. Be it carrying scars from the war, or a class difference of upbringing, or that demon addiction to alcohol, these men have to overcome themselves before they can overcome the biggest hurdle in front of them.

Boasting what reads as a who's who of great character actors, The Flight Of The Phoenix becomes a riveting watch because we feel the stifled nature of their plight, because we are blessed to have these wonderful actors fully realising the great writing from Lukas Heller. It is absorbing, it is very sharp, and fittingly we get a twist that makes the ending even more rewarding.

When once such trip ends in a crash, they find themselves stuck in the desert short of water, and of ideas as to how to get themselves home. Until that is, the rather superior ""Dorfmann"" (Hardy Krüger) concocts a plan to perform industrial surgery on the wreckage and maybe get them airborne again. What now ensues is a tautly directed series of escapades as the personalities of crew and passengers clash; the desert takes it's toll on the sanity of some, the Bedouin on the lives of others - but can they get out? Richard Attenborough is superb, as is the usually reliable Peter Finch and his sergeant Ronald Fraser - but it is the psychological duel between ""Towns"" and ""Dorfmann"" that stands out. Both actors really draw the audience into their predicament, and their characterisations work well to raise the palpable tension before an ending that ties together the surreal with the enjoyable in an innovative and exciting fashion. This is certainly one of Stewart's better performances, and is certainly well worth a watch.",7.0

In 1954, several high schoolers in southeast Florida pursue sex while tangling with the owner of a sleazy nightclub in the Everglades and his sheriff brother.

""Porky's"" (1981) is iconic in early 80's cinema, but it's a half good/half bad piece for me. It's too unpleasantly sleazy with corny sex-related jokes and the sexually ""liberated"" tone doesn't fit the mid-50s. I can't believe Susan Clark lowered herself to play the prostitute Cherry Forever; likewise, Kim Cattrall gets stuck with a (supposedly funny) humiliating scene. Furthermore, the young actors are clearly in the 24-30 range, not high schoolers. It would've made more sense to make this about college juniors/seniors.

But there are some good parts, like the 50's southeast Florida setting, the coming-of-age element, a few attractive females and an honest attempt to flesh out these youths with conflicts and so forth.

Unfortunately, the raunchiness leaves the viewer feeling dirty. For a much more palatable movie of this ilk check out the excellent ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" which came out five months later.

The movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes, and was shot entirely in southeast Florida (Miami, Miami Beach, North Miami, North Miami Beach, Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale and North Bay Village).

10249,"Rocketeer is directed by Joe Johnston and co-written by Danny Bilson, Paul De Meo and William Dear. It is based on Dave Stevens' comic book The Rocketeer. It stars Billy Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Alan Arkin, Timothy Dalton and Paul Sorvino. Music is scored by James Horner and cinematography by Hiro Narita.

It took eight years to get to the screen, with many rewrites, changes in personal, changes in setting and etc, the only thing consistent was Disney's inconsistency. Once out the film received generally positive reviews but posted only a small profit, in the wake of a Tim Burton inspired reinvention of the Super Hero genre, Rocketeer fell away into cultdom, sequels planned were shelved and its reputation remains to this day one of being a misfire. Unfair say I! Rocketeer is a lovingly crafted adventure film, nodding towards the serials of the 1930s, it's awash with period Hollywood delights, Art Deco imagery, has a damsel in distress, square jawed heroics, Nazi villains, wonderful effects and a blunderbuss Zeppelin finale. Backed by beautiful smooth tone photography and an evocative heart stirring music score, it's a family friendly blockbuster that ticks all the requisite boxes. The quality of the action sequences still hold up today, and Johnston, who wanted the job big time, directs with a knowing grasp of the setting, and crucially he never once loses a grip on tone and pacing. There's no self parody here, no deep Fruedian dissection of the main character, just a honest to goodness good against bad axis, with a romantic cause deftly wafted over proceedings.

The role of Cliff Secord (Rocketeer) proved hard to cast, where Vincent D'Onofrio turned it down and ""name"" actors such as Dennis Quaid, Emilio Estevez, Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton auditioned for the part. Paxton, it's believed, was very close to getting it as well. Disney wanted an A list man, Johnny Depp and Kevin Costner were mooted, but Johnston had a feel for unknown Billy Campbell and managed to convince nervous Disney heads that he was perfect. Much of the scorn that has flown towards Rocketeer has landed at Campbell's door, again, this is unfair. It's hard to tell if one of those A list actors could have made the character work better, for it helps in this instance to not have a familiar face propelling the adventure. There's an innocence, an awkwardness to Campbell's portrayal that just sits right for a guy stumbling upon a rocket pack and finding himself submerged in a chase and harry battle against bad. He also has the looks, a handsome dude who creates a homespun based chemistry with the sensuous Connelly. It's Dalton's movie, though, he's having a devil of a time as the chief villain. Modeled on Errol Flynn and the spurious notion that he was once a Nazi spy, Dalton has the looks, the gusto, the moustache twirling shiftiness and a voice perfect for such material. A roll call of great character actors fill out the support slots, with Terry O'Quinn, Paul Sorvino and Ed Lauter particularly striking the right chords.

A smashing piece of escapism, no pretensions or ideas above its station. The willingness to tap into the basic premise of a comic book actioner and entertain in grand Hollywood terms, to be applauded. And I do, and I do love it so. 8/10",8.0

<em>'The Rocketeer'</em> exceeded my expectations in truth, I wasn't expecting much given the opening few minutes. However, thankfully, it ends up producing an entertaining 108 minutes. Cool superhero, great score and a likeable cast list.

The premise is properly bonkers, especially towards the end, but they make it work and deserve credit for doing so. There are numerous recognisable faces onscreen, all of the main talent give good performances.

Billy Campbell plays the lead role, Cliff. I've (relatively) recently become aware of him via television's <em>'Cardinal'</em> - which is outstanding btw, check it out if you can - and loved him in that, he's also very good in this. Jennifer Connelly (Jenny) and Alan Arkin (Peabody) are also involved, as are Paul Sorvino (Eddie) and Timothy Dalton (Neville). I enjoyed Dalton, he portrays his role very well.

A young American writer (Corey Sevier) and his two friends go to Hungary to research Countess Bathory wherein they happen upon a mysterious woman (Irena Violette) who leads them to the notorious citadel, which involves some perils. Once there, they learn of the ancient feud between the Bathory line and the Thurzo dynasty, plus way more. Christopher Lambert plays the head of the latter clan.        

“Metamorphosis” (2007) is castle horror in the tradition of ""Devil's Nightmare"" (1971), “Howling V: The Rebirth” (1989) and ""Subspecies"" (1991), but with some ideas borrowed from “Reeker” (2005), which I can’t give away. I loved the set-up, which involves the first 45 minutes or so with spectacular central Europe locations (cited below). Unfortunately, the mayhem in the castle gets increasingly tedious in the second half, even cheesy (I recommend just rolling with it), but there’s an interesting twist in the epilogue.

Lambert has fun with his role while the statuesque Irena Violette does well in hers, not to mention she’s pleasing to the eye.

Two issues that the movie ignores: Bathory’s citadel is Čachtice Castle, which is in ruins and is located in Slovokia, not Hungary, although the area was part of the Kingdom of Hungary 400 years ago. The castle is about 65 miles north of the northwest border of modern-day Hungary.

Through the dark power of witchcraft, however, she returns as a wannabe seductress to enact revenge. Matthew Marsden and Claudette Mink play a married teacher and administrator at the school. 
 
“Tarmara” contains elements of “Carrie” (1976), “The Rage: Carrie 2” (1998), “The House on Sorority Row” (1983) (which was remade as “Sorority Row” in 2009), “The Craft” (1996) and “The Faculty” (1998). Yet it mixes its own brew and, surprisingly, has a few original aspects, along with respectable gore, if that’s your thang. The movie influenced future flicks like “I’ll Always Know what you did Last Summer” (2006) and, especially, “Jennifer’s Body” (2009). If you like these kinds of films, you’ll like this one.

There are some awkward or un-compelling moments in the filmmaking. With just a few key tweaks this could’ve been great in the manner of “The Rage: Carrie 2.” Still, it’s good enough and, like I said, has some innovative parts. Marsden and Mink are strong as the adult protagonists. The women are cute (e.g. Katie Stuart as winsome Chloe) but, with the exception of Mink, they look like they’re suffering mild anorexia.

It's at this point that what was a powerful and personable drama starts to come off the rails. There is a cruelty to the narrative that no amount of power-ballading is going to mitigate. I went from being broadly engaged by the ""Yentl/Anschel"" character to being really rather disgusted by the selfishness on display. Certainly that's partly a testament to the acting of Streisand and to the scene-stealing Irving, and it's a potent indictment of marital traditions that don't just exist within the Jewish community, but I still found the preparedness of this would-be scholar to engage in something quite so unkind rather put me off a story about which I no longer cared. The production design is authentic looking and the supporting cast for the first part of the film are engaging, lively and even a little mischievous. ""Papa"" and ""A Piece of Sky"" clearly demonstrate the Legrand/Bergman/Streisand partnership at it's most musically powerful but in the end did this film show us a woman bent on self-improvement or one just concerned about herself? I think however pertinent the purpose of a film may be, it's important for the audience to feel some sympathy with the plaintiff, so to speak.

10278,"_**Great moral conundrum and message, but too contrived**_

""Return to Paradise"" (1998) is about three Americans in Malaysia. Two of them are friends from New York City (Vincent Vaughn and David Conrad) and the other they meet there, an environmental-hippie type (Joaquin Phoenix). The three have a great time partying together and then the two from New York go back to the grind in the USA. Two years later they find out that their friend in Malaysia has been in prison for having too much hashish, which the three purchased together. Due to the country's severe drug laws, those considered traffickers are put to death and, unfortunately, the hippie possessed beyond the limit. He'll hang in eight days unless the other two go back and they'll all get 3 years in prison; if only one goes back it's 6 years each. Will they go back?

That's the set-up of the film and it's not a spoiler since this all unfolds in the first 20 minutes, which means that most of the rest of the movie takes place in New York and focuses on whether or not the other two will go back and save their friend. Keep in mind that this was a dude they met in Malaysia so it's not like they were bosom buddies from their youth or anything.

The trailer of ""Return to Paradise"" miss-advertised the film as a thriller largely taking place in exotic SE Asia, but that's not the case. This is a drama that involves a moral conundrum, a Christ figure and possible redemption. The story concentrates on Vaughn and Anne Heche, the latter as the lawyer of the hippie who tries to convince the other two to go back to save their friend. Complicating the situation even further is the fact that there are no legal documents involved since Malaysia is a third world country and, as such, there's no guarantee that the two will ""only"" get three years. And what about the other potential negative possibilities, like never making it out of the hellhole alive?

This is a top of the line film and the producers went all-out to serve up a quality picture; for instance, the Malaysian prison scenes are very convincing. Also, the actors are great across the board and Vaughn proves that he can nail a dramatic role. Moreover the moral is to die for, no pun intended. Unfortunately the actors are strapped to the contrivances of the plot and I had a hard time seeing them as real people in a real situation. In other words, it seemed like the characters do this-or-that merely because the screenplay says he or she is supposed to do this-or-that at that moment. And so I was never really able to embrace them as real people, but rather as puppets manipulated by the script. Still, it's not bad and it's worth catching if you like the actors and the story trips your trigger.

Summer of Sam is directed by Spike Lee and Lee co-writes the screenplay with Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli. It stars John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody, Mira Sorvino, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Rispoli, Saverio Guerra, Brian Tarantina, Al Palagonia, Ken Garito, Bebe Neuwirth and Michael Badalucco. Music is by Terence Blanchard and cinematography by Ellen Duras.

It was met with some indifference upon release, for many film fans went into it expecting another ""Se7en"" type serial killer thriller. What we get is Spike Lee doing a clinical character piece of how the residents in a South Bronx neighbourhood react to having a serial killer in their midst. It's 1977 and it's the time of the ""Son of Sam"" murders in New York City, mistrust and vile character traits start to come to the fore...

Lets face it, Spike Lee is often about as subtle as a sledgehammer over the head, but when it comes to characterisations - particularly when it comes to New York - he's one of the best around. He positively revels in dropping a group of unsound characters into a pressure cooker atmosphere and let them play out their respective human fallibilities. Who else could run a concurrent strand of a serial killer with a serial adulterer and produce such edgy and sly rewards?.

The musical backdrop to the plotting gives us the move from disco into the punk explosion, with the juxtaposition between good friends - Leguizamo's disco dancing philanderer and Brody's (excellent) punk rocker turning gay tricks to pay for his musical aspirations - proving to be more pivotal than ""Son of Sam"" (Badalucco off the chain) himself. All while the ""hood"" lowlifes gather themselves as an army to seek out the serial killer themselves, which unfortunately means anyone remotely not in their circle of friends is a suspect!.

It's no Lee masterpiece, for it's a touch too long and could have been trimmed by 15 minutes of pointless sexual exposition, while it sometimes feels like Lee is stuck between blaxploitation verve and mainstream appeasing ticket selling. Yet it's a bold piece of film making, with some genuinely jaw dropping sequences within. Prepare for a film that's big on characters during the reign of a serial killer and you might just appreciate Summer of Sam much more. 8/10",8.0

Soon, Billy is dropping three or four pounds a day. He seems to be disappearing before everyone's eyes, but concern sets in. He is eating twelve thousand calories a day, still losing weight, and now Heidi and his doctor (Sam Freed) are spending a little too much time together. Billy decides to track down the gypsies, especially after hearing and witnessing others in on the conspiracy were cursed as well, and he mistakenly enlists Richie to help him.

Greg Cannom's special effects make-up is phenomenal. He has won Oscars in the past, and he should have won again for this film. Burke is totally believable going from 300 to 124 pounds in the span of the story. It helps that Burke's performance is as flawless as his make-up. He does not let all that latex and rubber get in the way, and goes from sympathetic to slightly deranged rather well. Jenney is also good as Heidi, although her character is often relegated to the ""supportive wife"" routine. The first hour of the film is very suspenseful. Billy is chasing the gypsies, and the authorities are chasing him. However, the film's biggest flaw was also the novel's biggest flaw- letting the convenient mob friend Richie help get revenge on the gypsies. Mantegna is one of those great actors who never receives his just credit, but here his character is just a caricature of mob types Mantegna has played before especially on ""The Simpsons""- try listening to Mantegna and not hearing Fat Tony. Holland's direction keeps things fresh, he shockingly shot this on location in Maine instead of fleeing to Canada like most Hollywood films, but the screenplay feels rushed most of the time. I wonder if this would have made a more effective transition to mini-series form, something King has done before. I was surprised by ""Thinner.""  Considering what some film makers have done to King's work, it is a better adaptation when put in that context. Strongly anchored by believable make-up and gore effects, and a fantastic central performance, I recommend it.",8.0
10281,"There's a legend around here. A killer buried, but NOT dead.

Jason Voorhees is unintentionally revived from his watery grave by a girl with telekinetic powers.

And so the Friday the 13th bandwagon rolled on for another sequel, a part 7, that once again pitches the unlikable Voorhees against a number of annoying teen types. Those involved here deserve some respect for at least trying to add some impetus to the flagging series, here by way of a gimmick, that of a telekinetic foe played by Lar Park-Lincoln, but ultimately it just ends up same old same old. In fact it's a considerable step down from the more fun and funky part 6. 

The telekinetic issue becomes something of a side-bar, which is annoying as there's a potentially great thread involving a devious doctor (Terry Kiser) that never reaches the heights it should have. There's a little thought in the writing as regards grief management, but ultimately all hope of something more substantial gives way to Voorhees slicing and dicing kids we don't care about anyway. We could watch the first 3 films if we wanted that again.

10281,"***""Carrie"" vs. Jason with a subpar script***

Released in 1988, ""Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood"" takes place about ten years after the previous film, which explains its title ""The New Blood"": Tommy Jarvis is no longer in the picture and there's a new set of youthful blood for Jason to spill. This installment is the second to feature Jason as an inhuman rotting corpse and the F/X of Jason at the end are great. The highlight of Part VII is the inclusion of a Carrie-like heroine with mental powers who squares off against Jason at the end. We also get Terry Kiser as Tina's therapist, Dr. Crews. If you're not familiar with Mr. Kiser, he played the charismatic preacher in 1968's ""Rachel, Rachel"" in the mind-blowing Pentecostal service sequence.

Although my title blurb describes this segment as ""Carrie vs. Jason,"" it's the same Friday the 13th formula, but with a protagonist who has Carrie-like abilities. The script is weak however and needed tweaked to work out the kinks, which makes it the weakest in the series next to Part III (and the last act of Part IX).

This entry features a quality collection of females, which the franchise is renowned for, but the creators failed to milk them for their potential, so to speak (and I don’t mean nudity or sleaze since the movie has a little bit of both). For instance Jane (Staci Greason) and Robin (Elizabeth Kaitan) are the top women, but not enough is done with them. Jane’s role is too brief as she’s the first to buy the farm while Robin eventually has some quality screen time, but the director fails to truly capture her beauty. For those who care, the attractive Sandra (Heidi Kozak) has a brief skinny dipping scene. Meanwhile Melissa (Susan Jennifer Sullivan) is decent, but she’s depicted as such a biyatch you almost WANT her to die.	

As far as locations go, Part VII was shot in Southern Alabama, just northeast of Mobile, with bits done in Southern Cal (e.g. the house where Robin is killed is in Topanga).

BOTTOM LINE: Part VII is another retread of the same Friday formula with the distinction of the protagonist having psycho-kinetic powers and, like the previous film, Jason is now totally inhuman, an infernal monster. In addition, the climax is the best yet, featuring the ""Carrie"" vs. Jason fight and a spectacular explosion. Unfortunately Part VII fumbles the ball a little in regards to its subpar depiction of the women. Worst of all, the script is amateurish like Part III. Nevertheless, it's a fairly entertaining installment that thankfully lacks the camp of III, V and VI.

NOTE ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILER***): No, the corpse of Tina's Dad was not left in the lake for ten years, the original ending made it clearer that her Dad's body coming out of the lake was a product of Tina's mind powers, although the long chain was real. Of course, this doesn't explain why Jason's corpse was still in the lake early in the film, but I suppose we could chalk that up to the curse that was on Crystal Lake and the fact that no one in their right mind would want to visit that part of the lake (near ""Camp Blood"") by this point in the series.

The film runs 88 minutes.

The added element of telekinesis, thanks to the badass Tina, which really sets this one apart. I really enjoyed seeing a final girl that also has supernatural powers that are able to truly take on Jason one on one. But other that Tina, there were not a lot of characters that were really memorable, most of them were the run of the mill teenagers that were simply there to add to Jason's kill count. The kills in this movie were pretty mild as well, although the sleeping bag kill is iconic and is probably the coolest kill in series history. I was really going to give this movie 3.5 stars, but the ending was so weird and corny that I had to lower it to a 3. Even though this movie takes a lot from part VI, the loss of Tom McLoughlin is definitely felt with the slight decrease in quality.

10283,"Friday the 13th VIII: Jason Takes a Boat.

Jason Vorhees is once again brought back to life and goes on a kill crazy spree aboard a boat bound for Manhattan.

As is the norm with the ""Friday 13th"" sequels, this one garners scorn and praise in equal measure, so you roll the dice and take your chance really. By now the makers were trying to come up with new ideas to keep the series afloat, here the gimmick is to take Vorhees out of his Camp Crystal Lake ""comfort"" zone, and pitch him on a boat - a boat which naturally is full of ripe high schoolers who are ripe for killing in variously gruesome ways. 

The presence of Manhattan in the title is not wholly accurate since three quarters of the pic is set on the said boat, with standard series rules applying, though Vorhees seems to have attained the dexterity of a paratrooper given that he remarkably appears in kill scenes where the time frame is impossible for him to do so. The sequences in Manhattan are fun, which only makes one lament that more time wasn't spent on this particular gimmick.

The acting is generally weak, while the effects work is standard fare - though the cinematography (Bryan England) is very impressive. So all told, it's another divisive ""Friday"" sequel, from breasts and butts, to blood and bone, and onto The Big Apple, part 8 you will either hate or think it's great. 6/10",5.0

10283,"***Jason takes a cruise to the big city!***

Released in 1989, ""Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan"" is a nice change of pace as the series was suffering from banality at this point; the previous installment is a prime example (people complain about Part V but at least it had an interesting new story angle with Tommy Jarvis going to the halfway house in the woods seeking succor for his psychological trauma, etc.). Part VII tried something new with the Carrie-like protagonist, and that entry has a great finale, but it was hampered by a subpar, amateurish script. 

Part VIII changes things up by switching the normal location of Crystal Lake (and surrounding area) to a ship going to Manhattan with a group of high school kids and adults aboard. Of course, Jason also gets on the vessel and starts systematically wiping out the youths. A handful of them make it to Manhattan, but so does Jason! The different setting is what distinguishes Part VIII. 

The story is split into four parts: The prologue takes place on Crystal Lake and features Jason's resurrection, which is a great opening. The brief first act takes place down the river from Crystal Lake at a docking inlet where the youths & adults board the vessel. The long second act takes place on the ship and the final act involves the survivors on a lifeboat and their adventures in Manhattan pursued by Jason.

Winsome Jensen Daggett stands out as the heroine Rennie and places as one of my top 3 or 4 Friday girls. Peter Mark Richman is also notable as Rennie's peculiar uncle/guardian and Scott Reeves as Rennie's sort-of boyfriend. Sharlene Martin is a highlight as Tamara and the filmmakers show off her physique, but she's so devious that she's a turn-off despite her good looks. Kelly Hu is also on hand.

The main complaint I hear about this entry is that it's called ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" but only the final act takes place in the city. This criticism never made any sense to me as the film spends more than enough time in the big city, the final 37 minutes, not to mention an opening snippet. The fact that the entire second act occurs on the ship keeps the movie from being one-dimensional.

This installment reveals that a fairly large river flows from Crystal Lake to an inlet with access to the ocean. The yacht in the beginning drifts down the river to the bay where the ship is docked. This is how Jason inconspicuously reaches the inlet. If there’s any doubt about this (due to the mistaken claim that the docking inlet IS Crystal Lake), pay attention to what the crazy deckhand says later on. 

As far as locations go, Part VIII was shot in Vancouver & Britannia Beach, British Columbia; Los Angeles (the alley way & wharf scenes); and New York City.

BOTTOM LINE: Part VIII is a worthy entry in the series and is notable for trying something new by placing the main cast in a cruise ship environment and the big city, plus Jensen Daggett is a highlight as the female protagonist. It's actually better than Part III and VII. Interestingly, Jason's facial F/X (shown at the end) aren't as good as the previous two installments, but they're serviceable.

10285,"***Great intro & first act, but kinda distasteful and convoluted with a cartoony last act***

Released in 1993, ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,"" aka Part IX, is the oddest entry in the series, along with the next one. But this isn't much of a surprise since three of the previous four installments were departures from the typical Friday formula -- Part V, VII (which features a Carrie-like character) and especially VIII (which switches the setting from Crystal Lake to a cruise ship and the big city).

The prologue shows Jason back at Crystal Lake. How'd he get back there after the events in Part VIII? The ending of that movie didn't show Jason completely destroyed, so we must assume that he made it out of the sewers of Manhattan and simply gravitated back to his familiar stomping grounds, which is only about 75 miles away. Anyway, the opening is excellent and highlighted by the most stunning female in the entire series, Julie Michaels as Agent Marcus (which is saying a lot in light of the series having the best line of women of ANY movie franchise).

Jason’s corpse winds up in the morgue in Youngstown, Ohio, and the film takes an interesting twist reminiscent of the 80's cult film ""The Hidden."" Other bizarre additions to the Jason Voohees mythos include a magic blade, a strange ""Jason-Finder General"" character and the disclosure of the only way the infernal monster can be killed and resurrected. I don't mind these revelations as the series was hackneyed after 8 films in 10 years from 1980-89, albeit still entertaining. Besides, there are enough typical Friday-isms to please fans of the series, for instance the entire camp sequence and the prologue, not to mention the return of an iconic character in the finale.

Some fans object to the main revelation on the grounds that Jason is supposedly a misunderstood man-child and this movie changes that. Actually the only films fitting this model are Parts II, XI and the 2009 remake. Parts I, V, VI, VII, and VIII were more in line with the idea of Jason as a force of darkness & evil, the curse on Crystal Lake or whatever. And Parts III and IV had him killing a pregnant girl, psychologically torturing the heroine, and attempting to kill a boy after slaying his mother, so he wasn't exactly Lenny from ""Of Mice and Men"" as these critics maintain. Face it, although Jason may have been an innocent deformed child at one time, the seed of evil (possibly a demonic spirit) entered into his heart at some point and he increasingly became a hideous hellish monster and you have to give this entry credit for trying to fill in the bones with corpse flesh, whether you accept these surprises or not.

Unfortunately, there’s a distasteful element to the proceedings, which is offset by the black humor a bit, and the final act goes so over-the-top with the action and horror shenanigans that the movie becomes cartoonish and laughable. A good example is the campy fight between the deputy and Steven. As such, ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is one of my least favorite in the series, along with Parts III and VII. Nevertheless, it’s entertaining enough and gets extra points for trying something fresh and interesting.

Besides the awe-inspiring Agent Marcus in the prologue, we get a couple of cute campers, Deborah and Alexis, with Deborah (Michelle Clunie) particularly shining. There's also Jessica, who turns out to be the main protagonist, her mom (the goddess Erin Gray from ""Buck Rogers"") and Vicki from the restaurant. Needless to say, great job on the female front, but they coulda done more with Jessica.

For those who care (I don't) this entry seriously ups the ante in the horrific gore factor.

As far as locations go, this installment goes back to Southern California in the tradition of Parts III, IV and V; specifically the Los Angeles area: West Hills and Thousand Oaks. 

BOTTOM LINE: ""Jason Goes to Hell"" gets props for its radical departure from the Friday formula, even while containing “Friday” staples: youths, babes, Crystal Lake, slayings and so on. But there’s a disagreeable air despite the amusement and the final act spins out of control with quasi-horror zaniness. Still, any movie that features Agent Marcus and Deborah can't be all bad.

The film runs 87 minutes (rated) and 90 minutes (unrated).

It's both refreshing and sad to see them try to re-invent Jason.  As a fan of ""Fallen"" I like the idea of the villain transferring from person to person, but they twist the concept a bit more than I would have wanted at points.

Adding a ""chosen one"" trope to this doesn't do much for me.  Having a nearly unkillable villain alone should be intriguing enough, adding extra rules to it doesn't feel good.

I'd like to see a Marvel style reboot where the government has to try to contain the heart, and they figure out the minimum safe distance, creating a facility around it with animals going nuts, and someone breaks in to find out what it is and is possessed.

This here wasn’t all that bad of a sequel. One thing it has going for it is that this one really has a lot of fun playing with its supernatural overtones which allows for some great scenes in here. A lot of this is due to the supernatural haunting-based attacks that occur in here which are quite chilling when based on the method of kills utilized to get the point across. The main scene involved with this is the attack in the bedroom, where the pajama-clad victim pops a zit, giving birth to a multitude of supernatural spiders from the wound and crawling over the bloodied body in a disturbing visual as she cuts away at herself in a particularly brutal fashion scores wonderfully, the motel assault is really chilling realizing that someone’s in there and. Likewise, the few small indicators of the ghosts’ background are quite fun with the flashes of her buried in the school as well as her dream of it being locked in the chest and crawling out for it being just as creepy and chilling as the other main attacks. This is mainly due to the ghost itself which is quite chilling, appearing with some nice facial distortions, creepy eyes and the wounds across the face making it pretty imposing while the flash lighting and quick moments leave it with a fine overall villain. As well, the curse that comes into play is quite nice with the ongoing mystery about her rampage and forcing the fun of the cemetery finale all makes for some good times to help hold off the few flaws with it. The most obvious one is that the really big, brutal deaths aren’t based on urban legends and seem just thrown in for no real reason. The film’s gimmick is that the kills are based around urban legends, yet neither being repeatedly stabbed in the chest with a broken beer bottle or urinating on an electrified fence and being shocked are real urban legends which doesn’t have anything to do with anything making the whole purpose of the exercise quite fruitless. Another big flaw is that the film has a really convoluted opening. There's no reason for there to be as many different angles and ideas thrown in, making it overwritten and convoluted. There's way too much going on to really get a handle of it all, and it makes the beginning really hard to get into. The last really big flaw is the jerk-cutting done in the attack scenes. This happens quite often, where it flashes in a series of scenes so fast that it's impossible to tell what's going on for the intention of getting some creepy images in, but they just ruin it by going too fast. This happens during most of the scenes, and becomes distracting. A minor flaw is the thoroughly underwhelming hot-tub scene, but it isn't as bad as the other flaws.

That plans pretty much hits the skids on day one when she meets her ex-boyfriend ""Pierre"" (Pascal Greggory) and his pal ""Henri"" (Féodor Atkine). What now ensues sees both of these men make a play for ""Marion"". The former with a more serious intent, the latter quite happy for the cinematic equivalent of a quickie. ""Marion"" is of her own mind here, though, and doesn't really play ball with either and all of these shenanigans impact quite profoundly on the young ""Pauline"", especially as she starts to become fond of ""Sylvain"" only to find that faith rocked by some of the game-playing from the competing ""Henri"" and ""Pierre"" as she has to do some premature growing up. At times this is a little over-contrived, with that sense that if something can go wrong it will or if it's vital that a person doesn't turn up just at that moment, then you just know they will - and that's a bit annoying on occasion as it tends to undermine just a little too much of the drama here. That said, it's still quite a different coming-of-age style of story that isn't limited to the maturing of the younger members of the cast. Langlet delivers delicately here and Greggory does get a bit under your skin as both men seek the attentions of a woman who's generally quite tired of the fickle attitudes of the men around her and ""Pauline"" just gets increasingly fed up.",7.0

It’s 1927, the Louisiana plantation home of Sam Hollis (Victor Buono), and Charlotte Hollis (Davis) is having an affair with a married man, John Mayhew (Bruce Dern). After a heated argument between Sam and John, John is brutally slain by an unseen assailant, only Charlotte appears on the scene covered in blood. Then it’s the present day and just Charlotte and her house keeper, Velma (Moorehead) live at the Hollis mansion, Sam having passed away many years ago. Charlotte is mentally scarred from the echoes of the past, she’s a recluse and seen by the townsfolk as the local mental case. As developers try to plough a road through the Hollis home, Charlotte sends for her cousin Miriam (Havilland), but then strange things start happening and Charlotte might once and for all tip over the edge.
 
A bit long at 2 hours 13 minutes and a bit too bonkers at times, Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte still comes out as glorious Guignol entertainment. The setting is perfect, a Baton Rouge locale of whispering trees and ominous foliage, the Hollis mansion a place of dark secrets, shadowy halls and mental disintegration. Biroc’s black and white photography seems to revel in the misery and emotional turmoil that blows about the place, and the brilliant Aldrich unleashes delirious turns from Davis and Moorehead as the others play perfectly restrained foil. There’s a strong mystery element driving the plot forward, because what we think is true may not actually be the case? The narrative deftly reveals back stories as film progresses, hints at means and motives dangle tantalisingly in the Gothic tinged air, and then the finale doesn’t disappoint, it has some surprises in store and closes the picture down handsomely.

Everything around her is disposable - except ""Karin"", whose repeated attempts to shock and hurt her lover might have worked in their bed, but they didn't work on me as I gradually wanted to brick them all in with a lifelong supply of Bombay Sapphire and let them grind each other to a powder.

I will say that the plot seemed a bit disjointed to me. The flashbacks weren't confusing, but in a slower paced film like this one, I think they were sometimes more of a distraction than plot-enhancers. The ending also had an air of an anticlimax to it, like - oh, okay. I guess it fit the laid back mood of the rest of the movie, but they might have done more with it.

George Clooney and Meryl Streep lead the vocal cast - and they are great - but for me, the star of the whole thing is Sir Michael Gambon's wonderful contribution as their principal, wonderfully odious, antagonist ""Bean"". The animation is simple and effective to watch and the writing is frequently pithy offering plenty for the older audience to take from this entertaining critique on responsibility, greed, revenge, loyalty - you name it, it's probably here somewhere. Roald Dahl had an amazing imagination and by imbuing the foxes with human traits (and the humans with some animal ones) here, he makes an whole load of attributes accessible to the audience in a more enjoyably tangential manner - traits that are not always honourable ones, neither.

The film was okay, but you have already seen it. This is the same old story where in America, the presidential running candidates do everything they can to win the precious votes, but here it takes place in a different country. Not bad actually, but disappointment is the American influence. Now I tell the truth that it was inspired by the real event. There's already a documentary film made, but now they altered it little and made a political-comedy.

The two campaign runners from the United States goes to Bolivia to aide two different candidates and becomes themselves confront once again. To gain the momentum, they have to go any length, so the fun begins when each others pull their legs. But who's going to stand ultimately and with what tactic is to be revealed in the next half of the film.

I think, except the American characters dominance, the film was refreshing like the locations, supporting cast wise. But actors like Sandra Bullock, Billy Bob Thornton et cetera holds the key. Obviously the star power is one reason and the other is for keeping the real event's touch. The film does not work for everyone, it did do nothing for me. The director of 'Pineapple Express' failed to deliver. But it was a bad screenplay, underdeveloped or maybe lacks some good lines and strong scenes. I totally suggest you to skip it, you would miss nothing.

10322,"**Peter Sellers' big farewell in a film that highlights his more chivalrous side.**

There are films that, even though they're good, cannot be consensual, and this is one of them. It's a film that conquers admirers as easily as it accumulates people who didn't understand it or didn't like it for whatever reason. I confess that I liked it, but I can understand both sides. The film has qualities, but it also presents a story that is not pleasant, and that is so far-fetched that it could never actually take place in real life.

The film presents a friendly character who is not easy to be indifferent to: Chance is a gardener who loves what he does and is very good at taking care of plants, but who was educated in a very informal way, confined inside a man's house. boss he served his entire life, without ever leaving, without ever going to school, without having any idea of the world around that house. The only glimpse of the world he had was through television, which he watches daily and with pleasure. When the boss dies, he is evicted from that house by lawyers who were not even aware of his existence. Without education, home or even documents, he wanders around the city and, by luck, ends up in the house of a very rich banker, ingratiating himself with his family with his adages which, however vague and inconsistent they may be, are taken as authentic pearls. of wisdom.

I have no doubt that there are very wise people in the world who have never set foot in school nor know how to sign their name. These are people who, having not had the opportunity to attend education in their lives, replaced it with a rich life experience and have very valuable empirical knowledge. I know people like that. However, it is inconceivable that someone has lived their entire existence within a house where they serve without ever leaving for anything, and without having documents of any kind. The script makes a mistake here, it exaggerates its proposition, and people's reactions afterwards are equally exaggerated and unreasonable. I recognize this.

However, the beauty of the tale created around the figure of this gardener, who never loses his purity, his kindness, is undeniable. And we really have to surrender to Peter Sellers' magnificent performance. The actor provides us with a discreet and elegant work in which he highlighted his best features, a restrained, almost aristocratic posture and slow, absolutely clear and well-pronounced diction. Unfortunately, he is almost the only actor to deserve a positive rating: Shirley Maclaine, Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden are good, but they appear absolutely bland and disinterested here.",9.0
10323,"I remember going to see this at a cinema in Glasgow aged 13 and loving every minute of it. The combination of some great Greek myth and some superb Ray Harryhausen stop motion animation was enthralling. 40-odd years later, it's still a great action adventure film that kicks off with a rousing orchestral score from Laurence Rosenthal then introduces us to poor ""Perseus"" (Harry Hamlin) who is living peaceably with his mother on a quiet island, unaware that he has a great destiny. Helped along the way by the rather mischievous ""Thetis"" (Maggie Smith) he arrives in the city of Joppa where he solves a riddle that enables him to free the city - and his beloved princess ""Andromeda"" (Judi Bowker) from a terrible curse. Snag is, her mother goes a wee bit over the top with the thank you speech and ""Thetis"" literally loses her head. Another task, even more perilous than the first looms pitting ""Perseus"" and his merry band against the Stygian witches, the three headed ""Cerebrus"" and then the dreaded ""Medusa"" herself. Sure, Sir Laurence Olivier hams it up a bit (""Zeus"") but there are engaging efforts from Burgess Meredith as his sagacious mentor ""Ammon""; Siân Phillips as the the Queen ""Cassiopeia""; Dame Flora Robson is one third of the all seeing witches with a voice you instantly recognise and there is even a glimpse of Ursula Andress too. The animations are the stars, though - ""Bubo"" the mechanical owl; Pegasus the flying horse and ""Kalibos"", the cursed half man half lizard all make for a great series of friends and foes for our intrepid hunters who must rush if they are to save his love from the giant ""Kraken"". Certainly, time has maybe not been so kind to some of then cinematography and neither Hamlin nor Bowker are much good - but it's still a cracker of a fantasy that I heartily recommend.",7.0

10328,"_**Discovering the ""fountain of youth""**_

On the surface ""Cocoon"" (1985) is about elderly folks at a retirement home in Florida unknowingly finding the ""fountain of youth"" via a pool on an adjacent property. A peculiar group of people rent the property to store boulder-like objects they take from the bottom of the ocean. As such, the pool acquires healing powers and restore's the old folk's youthful vigor.

Steve Guttenberg stars as the likable protagonist, the boat owner/operator who helps the people get to the objects in the ocean, but he has no idea what's really going on. The stunning Tahnee Welch, Raquel's daughter, plays one of the members of the peculiar group to whom Guttenberg's character takes a liking. Unlike Raquel, who's known for being a bit biyatchy, Tahnee shines with a winsome disposition. Brian Dennehy is also on hand as the leader of the odd group, and he does very well.

Most great movies have a deeper subtext, and so it is with ""Cocoon."" The story is a commentary on aging, death, grieving and the yearning for eternal life. The people of the peculiar group are types of angels or, better yet, the redeemed in glorified bodies. What they offer is the gospel, the key to eternal life in the ""new heavens and new earth, the home of righteousness"" (2 Peter 3:13). By ""the redeemed in glorified bodies"" I'm referring to the glorious bodies that are promised to believers at the time of their bodily resurrection (1 Cor. 15:42-44); these bodies will be imperishable, powerful and spiritual (not carnal) in nature. Believers will be able to defy gravity with these new bodies, walk through doors and teleport from one place to another, all of which can be observed in Jesus Christ after his resurrection.

Needless to say, ""Cocoon"" has an incredible subtext. But it's not necessary to get so deep. This is just an entertaining movie with a good heart. More than that, it's inspiring. On the downside, the final act is overextended and should've been trimmed down.

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot in the Clearwater/St. Petersburg area of Florida with the underwater scenes done in the Bahamas.

10328,"**It deserves to be remembered nowadays.**

I think the 80's were, maybe, the golden age of alien movies. Between comedies or horror films, the quality is quite satisfactory and there is plenty to choose from. This film is, however, one of the least known, perhaps due to the light way in which everything was approached, and it has even fallen into unfair oblivion today. For me, it was a movie that worked better precisely because of that, not least because I'm not a particularly big fan of alien movies.

The film, in fact, is a very light and familiar comedy, pleasant and not made to think too much, nor to be an award-winning film. I really got the feeling that it was an unpretentious project that, at the time, gave very good results, having even won two Oscars, for Best Visual Effects and Best Supporting Actor (for veteran Don Ameche).

The script is quite simple: a group of friendly old timers from a nursing home, who have the habit of visiting the pool of a neighboring abandoned mansion, have just discovered that their new owners have mysteriously changed the water with gigantic stones from the bottom of the sea: now, in addition to being warm, the water seems to have the ability to restore their youthful vitality and health. What they don't know is that the stones are, in fact, emergency pods left by an alien civilization that had an exploration base in the sea, nearby, which we learned to call Atlantis... and that the new owners of the abandoned house they are really aliens from a rescue team that came to collect the pods left behind thousands of years ago.

The film has a great cast that includes venerable names such as Don Ameche, Maureen Stapleton, Jessica Tandy, Wilford Brimley and Jack Gilford. In fact, and despite the merits of younger actors like Steve Guttenberg and Brian Dennehy, it is a film made to allow veteran actors a good opportunity to shine and show that age is numbers. I think I won't be exaggerating if I say that everyone enjoyed the film well and showed that they are doing very well, and that talent doesn't fade with age. I especially liked Brimley and Stapleton. Guttenberg has done better in other films, and Tahnee Welch doesn't do very well here either.

On a technical level, it's a very well-made film: the cinematography extracts the best of the sunny and seemingly paradisiacal environments of the places where the film was made, and the visual and special effects used fulfill their role in the film very well. We might even think that there are some cheap clichés, like the light on the boat, or the flying saucer, but as I said above, it's a light film, and we're only being unfair or overly demanding if we think about things like that. The soundtrack was in charge of James Horner, with whom Howard will make a series of films, and fulfills his role very well, without much fuss.",6.0

Anyway, they disappear so it falls to Curry and Laura Linney's ""Dr. Rees"" to follow the sagely guidance of the Quatermain-esque ""Kelly"" (Ernie Hudson) deep into the hostile terrain of the jungle. It's got just about everything required to make it flop, this film. Terrible acting, even worse dialogue - and that's just from the chatty gorilla that all too often saves the day - and some very cheap and cheerful CGI that merely serves to showcase the poor nature of this derivative and rather unremarkable effort. Curry (""Homolka"") is just not at the races here and Linney brings very little by way of gravitas or to her over-scripted role neither.

I'm not sure what it is about this movie, but it's just an easy, fun watch.

I'm not a huge fan of either one, but I'm not going to deny their acting ""chops"" and they bring it here, giving the audience a natural and fun atmosphere to the dilemma.

There are several very good improvements on original movie in this: cutting a lot of the thought narrative, adding a medium for the swap magic, having them wake up different instead of insta-switching, and several of the added plot lines really help fill out the world better.  A career woman is more interesting to follow than a housewife (not that it's necessarily more important), the romance line(s) in this are surprising and slightly less creepy, and swapping a sports game out for musical show not only allowed for the cross competition between character events, but also allows for some great alt rock music throughout the movie: I'll admit to enjoying a movie more when I can relate to the music better.

There are several good supporting actors (big and small), to include the Chinese restaurant family which, I think is a very nice cherry on top of the story.  By having the source of the magic be an outside party, I think it helps the complexity of the story without causing confusion.

There is a lot to like about this film, but unfortunately the limitations of its time hold it back, resulting in a somewhat boring viewing experience. 

For starters, the story was pretty good. I really enjoyed how the plot focused on a single group of survivors and their thought process as they attempt to deal with the horror and panic of the dead reanimating. There was a tremendous amount of lore delivered via telecommunication broadcasts that I thought added to the movie perfectly. 

The performances were uneven, some were quite stellar, particularly Duane Jones and Karl Hardman. But Judith O’Dea was quite bad. I’m not sure if it was her performance or the way her character was written but it was just bizarre to see her body language and gestures throughout the film. The beginning chase scene with her was fantastic, with some stellar cinematography. But after that, the way she portrayed shock was laughable. 

The action in this movie was bad, with punches being all too slow and clunky. I would imagine this movie was quite scary for the time, but with modern day horror constantly elevating, I hardly found myself unnerved.

10331,"**The film that practically founded the zombie subgenre.**

As I've said on other occasions, I'm not a fan at all of films about zombies and similar creatures. It's a type of horror cinema with a strong graphic appeal that doesn't really captivate me. However, I confess that I liked this film. It is much more moderate in its approach to these types of monsters, and effective in building tension and suspense. It's not scary (I believe it was very scary at the time, but these are different times), but it's entertaining.

The story told doesn't give us much explanation: we see two brothers who visit a grave in an isolated cemetery and, upon returning to the car, they are chased by what looks like a very disturbed man. It's obviously a zombie, and we know it, but the characters don't know and are extremely confused by what happens next: a growing group of zombies attacks them and forces them to seek shelter in a nearby house, where shortly afterwards they realize that they are not alone and, thanks to radio and television, that the problem is not just there, but it's national.

George Romero was very intelligent in the way he conceived and wrote the film, which is an entirely independent production and the result of the ingeniously of everyone involved. It is an innovative work, it was one of the first films to bring zombies to the horror universe and the influence of “Carnival of Souls” is very clear in the cinematography, in the way the sound and soundtrack were worked on. The short budget forced the production to be very pragmatic and efficient, to do a lot with little and prioritize credibility and authenticity. I would like to highlight some effective effects such as the flesh eaten by zombies, fake blood and Molotov cocktails. The design of the sets and choice of filming locations is also to be congratulated.

The cast has a few points in its favor, but it is essentially amateur and only tries to do what has to be done. Despite being a minor issue and not usually subjected to reflection, it seems significant to me to highlight the choice of a black actor for the main role. Duane Jones, in the film of his life, does a very well done job, with great commitment and that fulfills everything necessary. Karl Hardman is just annoying and the two actresses, Judith O’Dea and Marilyn Eastman, don’t really add anything positive to the film, simply appearing helpless the whole time.",5.0

Luckily, ""Ben"" (Duane Jones) also finds the house and with a few emerging from the safety of it's cellar, they proceed to fortify the place as best they can and sit it out. It's soon clear from the television and radio reports that this is an epidemic and that those critters are resurrecting themselves and eating their victims. ""Tom"" (Keith Wayne) and girlfriend ""Judy"" (Judith Ridley) decide their best hope is to get the truck parked outside gassed up so they can all escape to the nearest town - but will that work? This film is almost as old as I am, and I am afraid to say it hasn't really aged an whole lot better. Much of the sense of peril comes from the frantic dialogue at the start and the scary elements are now more comical than menacing - especially towards the end. The regular use of the television reportage is useful at first but then seems more designed to pad out this thin story for a ninety minutes that I felt looked more like a TV movie that was just too contrived.

Bugsy is directed by Barry Levinson and written by James Toback. It stars Warren Beatty, Annette Benning, Harvey Keitel, Ben Kingsley, Elliott Gould and Joe Mantegna. Music is by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Allen Daviau. Film is a biography adaptation of Benjamin Bugsy Siegel, a notorious American mobster who rose to prominence in the 30s and 40s.

Barry Levinson’s epic film didn’t turn out to be the mobster film many had hoped for. There was great anticipation that this would be Levinson’s Goodfellas. What ultimately came to pass was a film of epic scope and detail, alive not with violence and mobster edginess, but of romanticism, of visionary peccadilloes and of folly. This is both a blessing and a curse, for Levinson seems to be caught in two minds between being respectful to his main characterisation, or unleashing the beast as we know it.

Story concerns itself with Siegel being sent to tidy up West Coast operations, from where he would fall in love with starlet Virginia Hill and become one of the most prominent names in Hollywood of the 40s. Whilst the pic has moments where Siegel seethes and teeters on the edge of murderous rage, much of the history here is scratchy to say the least, where again Levinson and Toback ignore just what a nasty piece of work Siegel was in real life, and instead put dreamy ideals and hot to trot passions in instead.

It’s all perfectly mounted, this is very good film making, it just always seems to be on the periphery of making a telling contribution to the Siegel legacy on film. Beatty is dandy and ever watchable, but this is not a Bugsy Siegel we can identify with, rendering an air of falseness to the story telling. The support cast are strong, though Mantegna as George Raft is miscast, but the likes of Kingsley and Gould make telling contributions with only morsels to feed off of from the screenwriter.

Have you ever tried to do something extremely complicated and ambitious and failed because of the enormity of what you were trying to do? I bet that even those to whom this has never happened will be able to name some examples: Pharaonic public works that went wrong or never came to fruition in full, private projects and companies that failed because of their own mistakes. There will be no shortage of examples, and I think we can add this film to that list, since the main flaw stems from the ambitions of its creator.

Wim Wenders is one of the great German directors of our time and no one can deny him this merit, not even those who don't really appreciate his style, or who criticize him (with some propriety) for having transformed, in recent years, into that kind of director that he criticized at the beginning of his career. However, what he wanted to do in this film was a task far beyond his capabilities and ingenuity. An epic lasting more than twenty hours that was condensed into a summary of three and a half hours and, years later, partially restored in the form of the “director's version”, lasting almost six hours. I made the mistake of trying to see precisely the latter, believing that I was seeing the version closest to the creator's vision. However, what he gives us is so uninteresting and so confusing that I wasted my time.

The story begins with the threat of an Indian nuclear satellite, which will crash to earth, and then introduces Claire, a young woman who seems to be looking for a direction in her life in the midst of a futile existence. After a car accident in which she meets two bank robbers, she agrees to take the stolen money to Paris, in exchange for a percentage. In the midst of this, she helps a mysterious man who appears to be fleeing from a murderer and who steals some of her money. Committed to recovering him, she follows him around the world and ends up hiring a private detective.

As I believe you can already understand from this summary, the plot is not devoid of good ideas and had potential. With the characters always on the move, traveling the world, the film is not monotonous and has some potential for light comedy (although Wenders' humor is completely German, and we know what that means). However, the film gets lost in constant twists and turns that go nowhere. Circulating from one country to another, the plot wastes hours of our lives in a story without substance or content. Wenders doesn't spare us and gives us long scenes where the characters drive cars, walk or make phone calls. He looks like a five-year-old kid who starts telling his parents the most complicated story just to ask for a toy he saw in a store. This is what ruins the film and makes it unbearable. Oh, and of course, the issue of the falling satellite ends up completely forgotten in all this.

The production values are quite good considering it's a European film and the millions from the Hollywood machine are absent from the equation. Wenders managed to create some somewhat futuristic elements such as public telephones with video calling or police motorcycles with a bold and bizarre appearance. The urban settings seem hostile, with all sorts of trash and graffiti. The cinematography is magnificent, and the director makes the most of it, as is usual in the films he makes, but on the other hand, the soundtrack is virtually inaudible and does not add any quality to the final work.

Solveig Dammartin was a good choice for the main character. She is elegant, and gives her character a special charm throughout the film. Unfortunately, she can't do miracles with the material given to her. Sam Neill also makes the most of the occasion in the best way he can, but the film is far from being one of the best of his career, and the same can be said of William Hurt. Both are committed, and the work of this trio of actors ends up being the most redeeming value that the film has to present to us.

At times it's jaunty when the scene appears to call for menace, and at others just plain boring if the scene was meant to be actually funny (in that sarcastic, almost satirical way). The film could have worked at either being a comedy or a thriller, but the fusion of the two just doesn't work, and this failing has to fall at Williamson's door, it's as if Scream was all a fluke after all?

Given its low rating, it's hard to know what sort of film the critics and general movie watching public were expecting with this one. Since a buddy buddy cop movie staring James Belushi and a German Shepherd Dog doesn't say anything other than the film we actually get. By the time of K-9's release it was evident what sort of film would be Belushi's staple money earner, the kind that called for him to play the cocky quipper with a glint in his eye. Belushi would try to abandon his buffoonery roles post Curly Sue (who could blame him after that mess really?), and attempt to be a more dramatic action type actor. It wouldn't work, his excellent performances in Oliver Stone's Salvador and The Principal (the latter also criminally undervalued) were long behind him. So you hear the name James Belushi in relation to films and you by and large think larking about action comedies. Coming a year after Red Heat (it looks like Belushi is wearing the same suit from that film in this one!), K-9 delivers exactly what it screamed out it would from the off.

Technically the film has very few things to recommend, but as a family friendly action comedy it has much to laud. The interplay between man and dog is great fun, they are both members of the animal kingdom, they both got needs and they are both great cops. Yes we are never in any doubt that after a troubled start, this pairing are going to become firm friends, and that ultimately, by hook, crook and paw, they will get the job done. Belushi has a nice line in facial comedy and he also never comes up short in delivering quips with panache, and a confidence that often belies the trouble his characters are often in. The dog too is hilarious (hats of to animal handler Robert Zides). Courtesy of writers Steven Siegel & Scott Myers, this is a dog that eats chili and wants to vie with Dooley for Tracy's affections (Mel Harris as Dooley's frustrated girlfriend). It makes for a number of funny set-ups that both man and beast revel at being involved in. Kevin Tighe as villain Lyman is a touch under written, and the obligatory emotional heart tugger moment now looks like over egging the formula pudding. But this is harmless witty fun that gets in and does its job without proclaiming to be anything other than what it is. 7/10",7.0
10347,"Vincent Cassel is the eponymous bank robber who leads a gang of what can only be described as desperate and disparate eccentrics. Hot in pursuit are the police but they are having little effect until they decide to let the ruthless ""Cristini"" (Tchéky Karyo) take charge of the investigation. What now ensues is an increasingly bizarre and surreal heist caper that leaves virtually nothing out of bounds with loads of violence, dark comedy, transvestism and then, more violence. I rather liked the ending - it was not what I was expecting nor is it typical of the genre. The writing is pretty ropey though, and the lighting could have been doing with some extra wattage so we could actually see what was going on for more of the time. As a drama it offers us a quickly paced and mildly entertaining, if very unlikely, glimpse of a seedy and grim sub-culture and Cassel - though he doesn't really feature so often - seems to be in his element. It won't be for everyone, this - it is actually quite sordid, and the narrative parodies just about everything from ""For A Few Dollars More"" (1965) to the ""French Connection"" (1971) with a bit of soft porn chucked in too.

Through a priceless gemstone, a malevolent djinn (Andrew Divoff) is released in Los Angeles where he harasses people by answering their wishes. Tammy Lauren plays the protagonist, Wendy Benson-Landes her sister and Robert Englund a collector of idolatrous artifacts. 
   
“Wishmaster” (1997) is inventive comic book horror with a thought-out script that features a villain/monster that is actually interesting for a change. The Djinn is superbly done and diabolically charismatic. Meanwhile Tammy Lauren is reminiscent of a younger Linda Hamilton. She’s likable and spirited, but doesn’t do much for me personally; and the role of Wendy Benson-Landes is too small to note.  The flick isn’t helped by its gaudy low-rent vibe and bland cast, but it entertains well enough with amusingly horrific effects, fun cameos and a unique concept.

I did think we were in for a biggest twist, but it kinda just goes the wall you - or, at least, I - expected. That's not actually a bad thing, as what is produced is entertaining and kept me interested throughout - it just feels like it is setting something different up at one or two points.

To be fair, there are plenty of great pyrotechnics and the film pretty much starts in fourth gear - but the ending really lets it down. Not the science, that's quite entertaining as they have to use subway tunnels, storm drains and quite a bit of dynamite; it's the ""have to rescue my daughter"" nonsense that spoiled it for me. Maybe there ought to be a rule that anyone charged with such responsibility is not permitted to have a teenage child anywhere within a 200 mile radius of their zone of responsibility? Yes, there are plausibility issues too - has the construction industry really been hoodwinking us all for so long? Is demolition really this easy?

Honestly the motivation that's in the descriptor for this movie was so easy to miss I'm not sure that they really explored it at all. I know _Se7en_ was popular and all, but people didn't like that movie just because it had a murder tableau, it actually had good story and characters in it too. _Resurrection_ does not.

10359,"Resurrection is a Se7en clone (complete with your standard copious rain) with no brains but lotsa guts. Instead of the seven deadly sins, the killer targets people named after apostles — five (5) apostles to be exact; I guess the full dozen would have taken too long a time.

Additionally, the villain harvests different body parts from his victims in order to “rebuild the boy of Christ.” Rebuild? Jesus was crucified, not hanged, drawn and quartered; why would his body need rebuilding? (now, if it were any of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, that’d be another story).

About halfway through the movie, the killer sends Det. John Prudhomme (Christopher Lambert) a tape; part of it is broadcast on the news, and some lady living in an apartment building recognizes the voice as belonging to one of her neighbors, who “seems like a very nice guy, but I bet a lot of those serial killers are like that.”

In a twist that would be clever if it weren’t so stupid, the neighbor turns out to be a blind man whom the real killer paid to make the tape. Really. So, according to this dumb broad, “a lot of those serial killers” are ""nice guys"", and blind? Maybe she thought he was just pretending, but either way isn’t this the kind of detail that might strike a witness as odd enough to at least, you know, mention it to the police?

All this nonsense will eventually pay off, however; patient viewers will be rewarded with one of the sickest, most blasphemous visuals visuals ever to grace a horror film, followed by one of the silliest. The former occurs when the almost finished FrankenChrist is unveiled.

I say ‘almost finished’ because, for some reason, the killer needs the heart of a baby born after midnight on Easter to a woman named Mary. Everybody got that? Good. Let me see if I can get this straight. The bad guy wants to “rebuild” the body of Christ on time for Resurrection Sunday — implying, like everything else, an adult JC — but he’s going to give it a Baby Jesus heart?

Thing is, this plan is not without risks and what now ensues is quite a complex analysis of the horrors of a wartime existence. Though I found the predictable comedy elements of this wore thin really quickly, it does offer quite a seriously thought-provoking look at just how warfare can affect a man. The constant pressures of remaining alert and vigilant whilst simultaneously dealing with day-to-day threat and tragedy are quite well illustrated in Mike Nichols' adaptation of the poignant Joseph Heller bestseller. There is a pretty stellar supporting cast, but their largely cameo roles augment rather than outshine the effort from Arkin as things gradually become more immediate for the man.

The results of that opens his eyes a little to the realities of life but now he struggles with adjusting and this leads to a sense of loneliness, isolation and even paranoia. The film is accompanied by The Who's eponymous soundtrack and it's at these points it is most effective, presenting a poignant and rather bleak look at pre-Thatcherite Britain that illustrates just how little hope there was for many and at how almost tribal existence could be on the streets fuelled with conflict, depression and confusion. At times it's a really intense and well focused drama and Daniels is ideally suited for his character. The rest of it is all a bit so-what, though. This hasn't aged particularly well and though maybe unfair to review 40-off years later, it's largely lost what impact it certainly had at the time and is largely devoid of even the darkest of humour to lighten the downbeat mood. Sure, it's brutal and violent at times, the language is honest and authentic and it depicts elements of racism and intolerance effectively, but the plot is a little like life itself. A meandering and frequently disinteresting series of occurrences that rarely merit remembering. It started many a career but somehow even that just seems to reinforce it's stereotyping analysis of society - as Franc Roddam saw it. It's to be commended for the intensity and clever use of hand-held photography but, perhaps because it is so London-centric, I just found it somewhat alien, over-rated and all just a little bit pointless.

So struck by the tragedy, he is coerced into signing up for a rehab programme at a remote asylum facility, but soon it becomes clear that the serial killer is still in his midst.

Famously delayed from being released for quite some time, D-Tox is like an itch on Stallone's CV that he will never be able to scratch. In truth it's quite serviceable as a formulaic thriller, but it's so derivative and, yes, dumb, it's hard to recommend with any sort of confidence.

Any number of thriller films you have probably seen will spring to mind when viewing this, but in short it's like a ""10 Little Indians"" meets ""The Thing"", with a side order of ""Seven"" thrown in for good measure. The first half is actually well built by the makers, establishing Stallone's emotional chaos, his dive into the bottle, and then setting him up in an institution that is frighteningly monolithic in a grey and steely way. His co-patients are all troubled coppers in search of a dry run, and this also sets things up neatly for some rich characterisations, unfortunately it all descends into cliché hell and wastes what is a rather superb cast - while Stallone unfortunately shifts from a believable tortured soul into a muscle head with a gun.

There are a few brief scenes with Kris Kristofferson as the head of the facility trying to assist; and quite a decent cast of likely culprits all keep the pace moving along, but the dialogue is dreadful and it's very formulaic in terms of story progression - it's quite easy to guess who the criminal actually is...

""My Cousin Vinny"" was a hit when it was released in 1992.

Vinny roles into town with his hot fiancé (Marisa Tomei) intent on winning his first big case.

I've heard a lot about this movie over the years, but never got around to seeing it till the other night and was pleasantly surprised. It's part fish-out-of-water comedy and part courtroom drama. The hulking Fred Gwynne plays the staunch judge, an amusing performance. It was Gwynne's last film.

The movie is filled with laughs throughout, but it's more than just a goofball comedy. At some point early in the second act I strangely found myself liking Vinny and wanting him to succeed. I also found myself warming up to Vinny & his fiancé as a couple. They're an odd couple, but somehow click. I guess this is where Marisa got the reputation for liking short, stocky men.

Speaking of Marisa, she's just stunning here, although I prefer her more as she gets older, e.g. 2008's ""The Wrestler.”

That is a hard thing to do, usually when Pesci is cast he's the best part of the film... and he was priceless in this... and Marisa Tomei out did him.

Carlyle never did repeat his performance in ""Trainspotting"" (1996) for me, ever since he has delivered some pretty undercooked efforts, and here is no different. Miller is on quite good form though, Tyler plays her part with gusto and there are a few engaging cameos from the suitably powdered-up Alan Cumming (""Lord Rochester"") that sit atop a supporting cast of hit and miss British comedy talent that many will have seen on television over the years.

It's the 1950s and young Hogarth Hughes happens upon a visitor from space ..... in the form of a giant iron man.

Delightful animation adaptation of Ted Hughes' much beloved 1968 novel ""The Iron Man"". Set during the period of time when Cold War and sci-fi paranoia was prevalent, The Iron Giant embraces these themes and stokes them with lessons of friendship, hatred, death and pertinent reminders of pacifism. Directed by Brad Bird and scripted by Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Though the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude that ran through many of the 50s sci-fi schlockers was one of being ""because we don't understand it, lets destroy it"" is something that Ted Hughes and the film makers here capture perfectly. Sophisticated and intelligent in its approach and delivery, this is definitely one of the better animated film's from the modern age. 9/10

A little girl with awe-inspiring abilities is raised by her aunt, Maggie O'Connor (Kim Basinger), because her mother is a drug addict (Angela Bettis). The latter hooks up with a weird cult, led by the arrogant Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), who wants the child for dubious purposes.

Released in 2000, ""Bless the Child"" is a thriller/horror that comes across as an inverted ""The Omen"" with elements of ""End of Days."" It has the same plot as the contemporaneous ""The Calling,"" but is more sensical.

It's no low-budget production as it cost $40 million to make and was directed by Chuck Russell, who's known for a few fairly significant movies, like ""Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors,"" the remake of ""The Blob"" and 1994's highly successful ""The Mask."" Despite this, ""Bless the Child"" comes across as a Lifetime movie with a higher budget, which explains the film's mediocre ratings.

While I understand this criticism I was able to enter into the world of the characters and enjoy the movie. It's not technically as good as ""The Omen"" (and some would say that it's sacrilege to even compare them), but I personally prefer ""Bless the Child"" simply because I like the story, characters and themes better, despite the film's limitations.

Concerning the cast, Kim Basinger was past her physical prime, but she still looks good and she's a likable and compassionate protagonist. Jimmy Smits co-stars as the detective on the case and he's effective, as always. Petite Christina Ricci shines in a small role as a runaway who tries to help Maggie. They're all good, but it's Rufus Sewell who's most memorable as the leader of a cult that mixes elements of LaVeyian Satanism with Sciencefictionology.

The CGI is a mixed bag, some of the effects are pretty good while some are just serviceable, but you have to consider the age of the movie. Regardless, special effects are just icing on the cake; it's the story and characters that count and this is where ""Bless the Child"" is solid—nothing great or exceptionally good, but solid.

Gangster 55 (McDowell/Bettany as the younger version) looks back on his brutal life, on how he became a gangster... 

The British gangster genre of film was gathering apace in 2000. Guy Ritchie's Snatch would wow critics later in the year, while Ben Kingsley's ferocious turn in Sexy Beast (David Scinto and Louis Mellis co-write on that as well) would even get an Oscar nomination, yet Gangster No. 1 is the equal of both films but still doesn't have the acclaim afforded the others - undeservedly so. 

Predominantly set in the late 60s, with period flavours strong, pic doesn't pull its punches, and yet it is never over gratuitous with the violence and mania (but you do feel it big time) that surrounds Gangster 55 (Bettany brilliantly feral and frightening). It's with the characterisations where McGuigan's film gets its strength, we witness greed, blood lust and the yearning of power via chilling portrayals, set to the back drop of a scuzzy London underworld where even the vermin don't dare to dwell. This is a film not wanting to be loved thematically, but the top performances across the board and pic's ability to grab you by the throat - to not let go - makes it a rip-snorting slice of evil. Essential for those interested in the British gangster film revival of the noughties. 8/10",8.0

It's not easy to make a good gangster movie. Sometimes it feels like they've done everything that could possibly be appealing or challenging, and that each new production is limited to chewing on and revisiting what's already been done by others, usually better. This film, set in London, brings us into a universe of violence and tension, of envy and madness, which is refreshingly dark and appealing, yet not really new.

The screenplay follows the criminal path of a British mobster whose name is never revealed and who, due to his brutality and competence, becomes one of the trusted men of Freddy Mays, one of the crime lords in London in the late 60s. However, he is ambitious, and his desire is, in the future, to be like his boss is: brutal, ruthless, but elegant and sober. It's a film where we follow the same character through thirty years of ultraviolence (I'm not using this word randomly, as you'll see) and sheer madness.

The cast has several strong names, and the main character is played by two actors: in the older chronologies, it is Paul Bettany, and today, it is the experienced and skilled Malcolm McDowell, who has participated in other intense films, such as _Clockwork Orange_. In fact, I can't help but think that Alex, the main character of that movie, iconic in this actor's career, could have evolved into a twisted and crazed figure like the one McDowell played here. The impeccable work, both his and Bettany's, is one of the pillars that sustains this film and that makes it truly intense and enjoyable. Both have memorable lines and dialogue. Another truly outstanding actor is David Thewlis, who harmoniously combines harshness and brutality with the sensitivity and almost aristocratic good manners with which he moves among other criminals. Saffron Burrows is beautiful, and works great as a love interest. The rest of the cast just tries to keep up with the main actors.

On a technical level, the film does a truly brilliant job of building and controlling the environment... the film knows how to build and manipulate the dramatic tension, letting it build up as time goes by, until a climax where we feel the lack of control and the loss of the notion of reality experienced by the central character. The slightly blurry cinematography, with many of the scenes shot at night or in low-light places (bars, rundown apartments, etc.), or the personality of the character, which shatters) or that scene where the camera puts itself in the skin of a man about to be brutally murdered, and we end up being invited to feel that moment, the fragility and mental weakness that takes over. of a man facing death, certain and painful. The movie's speech is full of profanity and rude words, but that's something inevitable, given the movie that it is. However, I recognize that it is not a film for any audience, it is extremely violent and brutal. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, impeccable and very well conceived.",9.0
10396,"""Tequila Sunrise"" is an incredibly turgid film for the most part and it seems to be much longer than it actually is which is the sort of underachievement any director worth their salt would be perfectly happy not to boast about at lavish Hollywood cocktail parties. The film has a desperately limited ration of surprises to offer any viewer willing to stay the course and such brave souls as these are apt to be very few and far between and for those gallant few of us willing to stubbornly persevere to the bitter end such eminently forgettable surprises hardly make the effort worthwhile because in the end they contribute absolutely nothing to the languid pacing.",5.0
10398,"This is a movie that we got a very long time ago when we still purchased a paper TV-magazine to know what was on TV every night. The last couple of years when we did that we frequently got a DVD as a “bonus” with it and this is one of those. According to my movie collection database we have had it since 2008 and last evening we finally got around watching it.

This is a quite okay movie. It will not blow your socks off but it is fairly okay and worth watching. It is a nice thriller/fugitive style movie to watch on a middle-of-the-week evening. I would probably not have been impressed had I gone to a theater to watch it but watching it as a TV-movie it was quite enjoyable. There are the usual silly moments that tend to be in these kinds of movies of course, starting with the stupid wife who just has to pick up the bloody knife just before the police arrives. Why do all (most) script writers have to put that crap into every movie?

I do generally like Tommy Lee Jones even though he tends to look and act pretty much the same no matter which movie he is in. I guess I like stability. The plot is okay. It is a fairly conventional husband frames wife, wife goes after husband kind of story and does not really provide any surprises.

One thing that caught my attention was that the car dealer apparently could do a credit check on a woman that was, as was found out later in the movie, dead since three years. I think someone missed the QA-checking of the script in terms of credibility there but then, as I said, the movie will not blow your socks of and the plot is fairly standard Hollywood fare with the usual silly stuff in it.",6.0

It seems there was no rhyme or reason for some of the changes. Events or spoken lines occurred at different times than I expected, or a different person said it, and even at least temporary changes in personality of characters occurred a couple of times. It didn’t reach the level of me giving up on the movie or contemplating a dismal rating here, but it was enough to leave my mentally scratching my head and vaguely thinking it could have been better.",6.0

I actually like Rob Schneider a bit, and the guy can certainly act, but it's like he got he's talent from a Monkey's Paw, there is usually some draw back.  In this, it's where the movie systematically makes fun of people from anger management issues, to serious conditions, to amputees, and all of them lonely and possibly desperate, so it's extra sad.

Yes, it's the premise of the movie that he's an unexpected gigolo with unexpected clients, but I'm not sure anyone was asking for this movie.

All that aside, this is a alternating abuse humor / ridiculous escalation humor, and a lot of the movie is just Rob being exasperated with his own script.  To top it off, it feels like there is one story line too many with the cop investigating him.  The angry gigolo with WAY too many expensive things that he mistreats is plenty of antagonist.

They definitely put the work in on the production side though, even incorporating a couple of matrix references that probably cost far more than warranted for the movie.

10403,"**A remarkable work.**

This is one of those films that I decided to watch without having a clear idea of ​​what I was going to find. I know that there are many people who like to know, read and even watch the trailers to decide what to watch, and I also do this moderately, but one of the sensations I like most in the cinematic experience is surprise, that feeling of pleasure, difficult to describe, that happens when a film pleases us and surprises us. Of course, the opposite could happen, the surprise could be bad, and the film could be magnificent rubbish. It happens! But I think you understand me...

Robert Altmann is not a director I know much about. As far as I remember, I've only seen one film of his, “Shortcuts”, and I wasn't particularly impressed. However, I think any director has their ups and downs, and you can't categorize anyone for just one film or two. In this film, Altmann surprises in a positive way, with very careful direction and an attention to detail that I was very pleased with. The cinematography is good, the editing is very well done, and the rhythm is quite pleasant, with no dead moments. The opening scene is a true cinematic masterclass, with almost ten minutes without cuts and lots of camera movement. And throughout the film, the feeling that prevails is that we are led to peek, in secret, into a story that no one wants to be known.

The script fits perfectly into this feeling of secrecy, taking us behind the scenes of the film industry through the hands of an arrogant and obnoxious producer who finds himself the target of anonymous death threats. He decides to question the person he suspects of, a screenwriter he ignored for many months, and ends up killing him. From then on, viewers are invited to follow him in his attempts to hide everything, along with the studio he works for, which has little interest in scandals. This is, obviously, a punch in the stomach of the Hollywood industry, where there is no shortage of unscrupulous, arrogant, pedantic, obnoxious people, willing to do anything for ambition, and where the moral conduct of the studios has not always been the most immaculate, preferring to ignore and /or hush up compromising situations whenever possible.

With these characteristics, the film had everything to cause hives in many people within the industry. However, it did surprisingly well, garnered a lot of praise, a good box office and was nominated for three Oscars, continuing to be, even today, a film that is regularly shown on TV channels specializing in films. If the technical quality and the intelligent and scathing story are fundamental, the cast also contributed with the union of talents of several renowned actors. Tim Robbins leaves us with one of his most notable works as an actor, with a consistent and impactful acting, and is elegantly accompanied by Greta Scacchi who, in addition to resisting the idiotic idea of ​​appearing naked for no reason, knew how to interpret her character in a deep and controversial. In addition to them, the film also features good performances by Pater Gallagher and Whoopi Goldberg in minor characters, and with a veritable rain of cameos and brief appearances by actors, screenwriters and others, playing themselves, with many of them agreeing to donate the salary for that single day of filming for a social project at the time. The procession of notables is almost endless, making this film perhaps the American film with the most cameos and guest stars in the history of commercial cinema.",10.0
10403,"It’s the job of “Griffin” (Tim Robbins) to secure good storylines for his Hollywood studio and he’s good at filtering out the wheat from the chaff. The thing is, though, he’s getting on a bit and there are rumours abounding that he is on his way out. When “Levy” (Peter Gallagher) arrives from an erstwhile competitor, the writing looks more like it’s on the wall than on the page. He’s also been having some difficulties with a mysterious stalker whom he’s spurned, professionally, at some stage and who is now bombarding him with threatening postcards. Finally, there’s his more off than on relationship of convenience with “Bonnie” (Cynthia Stevenson) to which he is surprisingly indifferent. Under pressure and under siege, his tormentor starts to get under his skin so he determines to get to the bottom of that whilst cleverly manoeuvring his new rival into a cul-de-sac that can only end one way! What now ensues sees a plethora of genuine stars pepper a film that allows Robbins to show us a character that’s shrewd, ruthless and charmingly shallow whilst at the same time not averse to taking drastic measures. It’s those that attract the attentions of tenacious detective “Avery” (Whooping Goldberg) who has a dead body, nobody to pin it on and is curious about the burgeoning relationship between the girlfriend of the deceased (Greta Scacchi) and this outwardly brash and smarmy film executive. This has all the ingredients of a comedy thriller with loads of glamour, a good deal of pithy dialogue and it sends up the Hollywood mentality satirically and plausibly. Robbins is in his element and exudes a sort of selfish obnoxiousness that’s actually quite likeable as he treads on the eggshells of a fickle and unforgiving business. It packs a lot of story into two hours, raises a smile and an heckle in equal measure and is probably Robbins’s best performance to date.",7.0
10404,"**In the context of oriental cinema, it's a good film... but it's very different from the cinema that we, in the West, are used to, and this difference ends up killing our interest in this work.**

I think this movie was the first Chinese movie I saw, I'm not really sure. I am not an expert on the cinema of this country, but I can say that it is one of those films that you see without much special interest. Of course, I'm talking about the standard audience, because there are really oriental film lovers who will be more interested in this material.

The script is based on the story of Song Lian, a very young and well-formed girl who, after her father's death, is coerced into finding a rich man to marry. She ends up being the fourth wife of a man, having to live with the other wives and learn how to behave in a complex family system, where rivalries and envy are part of everyday life.

The film shows us a type of family life that, for us in the West, is far from being understandable. It could only take place in strongly patriarchal societies, where the role of women is more than subordinate. It's not a great film, but it's frankly decent, and I don't rule out the likelihood that it's a classic of Chinese cinema (experts will opine better).

Gong Li does a very good job in the role of the young Song Lian, and is very well supported by Saifei He, Cuifen Cao, Lin Kong and Qi Zhao. Jingwu Ma doesn't do an inferior job either, in the role of the patriarch and husband of all those wives. The cinematography is very good, as are the costumes and sets, which take us back in time and geography. What prevented the film, perhaps, from being a greater success in the West was the lack of publicity and the difficulty in adapting to the environment of the film, which is very different from the cinema that Hollywood usually exports: it is much more meditative, passive and depressive than most of the cinema we used to see.",2.0

Entertaining! It's as if <em>'Dirty Dancing'</em> and <em>'Blades of Glory'</em> had a baby. The comedic parts work better than the more romantic parts, but all in all it's an enjoyable watch - even for someone who holds no interest in dance. It's also extremely predictable, but that doesn't trouble the film one bit.

Debutants, like Luhrmann himself, Paul Mercurio (Scott) and Tara Morice (Fran) work well together, with Bill Hunter being the standout support; though he doesn't top his performance in 2003 classic <em>'Kangaroo Jack'</em>. Sorry not sorry.",8.0
10409,"Rarely can one movie be credited with resurrecting an entire genre of programming, but this one certainly reinvigorated media - and participatory - interest in the reputationally staid pursuit of ballroom dancing. The young, accomplished and handsome ""Scott"" (Paul Mercurio) is determined to get to the top and to do it his way. He is not content to stick with the status quo as defined by the ageing committee led by the buffoon that is ""Barry Fife"" (Bill Hunter). His parents are sceptical, but when he alights on ""Fran"" (Tara Morice) then the championships are in their sights and the rules are there to be broken. Baz Luhrmann allows the cast and the dancing to do the work here. The dialogue is earthy, and witty at times but for the most part there is plenty of dancing that illustrates well the tough regimen of discipline required to perform at the highest levels in what is generally considered a rather sedate pastime. There are strong supporting characters a-plenty - not least his mother ""Shirley"" (Pat Thomson) and rather shrinking violet father ""Doug"" (Barry Otto) to complement the really rather excellent Hunter (and his toupé). It packs loads into ninety minutes and uses a fine soundtrack to help keep the whole thing moving along entertainingly.",7.0
10409,"**A film that remains fresh and enjoyable, even if the plot suffers from irritating clichés and other problems.**

Dance is one of those arts that is occasionally portrayed in cinema, and this film is reasonably similar to others that focus on ballroom dancing and major dance competitions (I'm thinking of the most obvious example, “Shall We Dance”, but there are others). Directed by Baz Luhrmann, it is one of the least acclaimed films of this director's career, but the fact that it went unnoticed does not take away from its qualities: it is undoubtedly a good film to watch and the story it tells us is still fresh.

It's not worth summarizing the plot, which centers on a young adult, under intense pressure to win an important dance prize, and the relationship he establishes with his newly discovered dance partner who quickly becomes his girlfriend. However, this young man wants to dance without feeling tied to the meticulous execution of already established steps and choreographies. This displeases the president of the Australian Dance Federation, who sees this creativity as a rebellious act against the codes of ballroom dancing. The film is a very effective romantic comedy, with very witty and engaging moments that work wonderfully well. The energy and joy that emanates is contagious and makes the pace faster, but the romantic plot is cliché and leaves the film predictable to the point of absurdity.

If the script has its weaknesses, this is largely compensated by the well-structured and remarkable work of the actors: let's forget the fact that even the glasses of Fran, Tara Morice's character, are an old soap opera's cliché, and see the work that she develops: although it is not an award-worthy effort, it is undoubtedly positive. Paul Mercurio, the main actor, is sullen and even rude towards his partner and other people. We also can't ignore that he doesn't have any kind of charisma (maybe that's why this actor wasn't successful), but he establishes a very good working relationship with Morice, and they develop harmoniously together. The secondary actors had better luck with the characters: Bill Hunter has the right to a very interesting character, with grotesque but well-crafted nuances, and Pat Thomson also did a well-done job.

On a technical level, the film stands out not only for the excellence of its soundtrack, where I would like to highlight the version of “Time After Time” (a classic that never leaves the ears of those who lived through the 80s and 90s), but also for the good quality of the sets, costumes and props used. I don't know if the film had a very high budget, but it can be seen that there was a strong and consistent investment in these elements, particularly in the construction of the spaces and the design of the dresses and dance costumes used in the competition scenes.",7.0

To that end he hooks up with the mob (Armand Assante) before coming up against an equally focussed Bobby Kennedy (Kevin Anderson) bent on sending him to jail. The extent to which much of the detail in this interpretation of their lives is true is anyone's guess, but this depiction is a compelling one with two strong leading performances and a well paced feel to it. It also tracks the political scenario quite well too. We get a sense that, initially at any rate, Hoffa did want to improve the lot of his 1.8 million members before a degree of invincible megalomania set in. Director Danny DeVito offers us a potential conclusion too - as yet, nobody knows what actually happened to this powerhouse of a man, and though it is a bit too long, this is still a good watch.",7.0

10423,"A celebration of the inimitable Bruce Lee and what he represented

RELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Rob Cohen, "" Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" stars Jason Scott Lee as the martial arts superstar, tracing his early life in Hong Kong to his fresh start in the San Francisco area where he starts a martial arts school, meets his babe (Lauren Holly) and moves on to TV and Film. He must boldly face many enemies along the way, including his childhood demon. 

This is basically a rags-to-riches flick and ranks with my favorite films due to its excellent meshing of dynamism, fun and potent drama. I haven’t seen too many martial arts flicks, but “Dragon” is easily the all-around best of those I’ve seen. It mixes real-life with Hollywood mythmaking, which is what many cinematic biographies do, e.g. ""Buffalo Bill"" (1944) and ""Braveheart"" (1995). In these types of movies the gist of the story is true, but it's mixed with numerous fictional or even fantastical elements to make the protagonist a larger-than-life hero, but also to entertain the audience because real-life is always more mundane and therefore dull. And movies are made primarily to make money through entertaining, not to relay the truth in exact detail. 

Right from the get-go the film telegraphs that it's a mythmaking account when Bruce takes on the arrogant British sailors at a dance. He throws one of them and the sailor topples 3-4 other men accompanied by the sound of a bowling ball striking pins (lol). While this particular episode never happened, occasions LIKE IT did, even if it was to someone other than Bruce. The same is true with other sequences, like the fight in the gym, which never happened. But, again, events LIKE IT have.   

The movie is really meant as a celebration of Bruce Lee, his phenomenal expertise in martial arts and the genre he made popular. If you're looking for an actual biography of his life check out the two biographies listed below (under “WRITERS”). 

Speaking of which, “Dragon” was partially based on the autobiography of Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce’s wife). Someone offered that she couldn’t possibly have been happy with the film since so much of it is fiction (for instance, Bruce didn’t injure his back as depicted, but via lifting weights). Actually, she was happy with the final picture. But why did she allow so many things to be embellished? Simple: Because the embellishing fed into the Bruce Lee legend from which she benefits.

In any case, there are a lot of martial arts thrills mixed with the drama with an exciting action scene occurring roughly every ten minutes. The film gives the protagonist & a few others power over time and space. Of course, one cannot do in real life many of the things these characters perform due to the restrictions imposed by Newton's Laws but, hey, it’s entertaining. This factor explains why “Dragon” has been criticized for springing from one thing to the next too quickly, never pausing long enough for any strong emotion to resonate or for us to feel we really know the man beyond his proverbs. I disagree; I sensed strong emotion on several occasions, like when Bruce exclaims to Linda: “You make be believe I can do anything” or when he wildly screams at her to leave his hospital room, not to mention his outstanding meltdown later in Hong Kong (I’ve had a few of those in my life, so I know).

Speaking of Linda, Lauren Holly is just mind-blowing in her physical prime.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours and was shot in California (San Francisco, Los Angeles & Valencia), China (Macau) and Hong Kong. WRITERS: Three screenwriters wrote the script based on the biographies by Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew) and Robert Clouse (Bruce Lee: The Biography).

Jennifer 8 is written and directed by Bruce Robinson. It stars Andy Garcia, Uma Thurman, John Malkovich, Lance Henriksen, Kathy Baker and Graham Beckel. Music is by Christopher Young and cinematography by Conrad Hall.

The small town of Eureka and John Berlin (Garcia) is the new cop in the precinct. When a severed hand is found at the local dump it leads Berlin to believe a serial killer is at work. One who has a penchant for blind girls.

The problems quickly mounted up for Jennifer 8, it flopped big in America and went straight to home format release in the UK. Problems back stage got so bad that Bruce Robinson quit Hollywood and never made another film for 19 years! In spite of these facts, it’s not the monstrosity it was originally painted as back on its “limited” release.

It’s a frustrating film in many ways because it promises so much. There’s bags of moody atmospherics wrung out by Conrad Hall’s superb photography, where he filters most things via minimal lighting. Much of the play unfolds in ominous surroundings, where dialogue exchanges are either hushed or laced with harried fervour, and the writing is actually quite smart as it blends psycho thriller staples with strong characterisations that are in turn boosted by committed acting performances. Yet these things can’t compensate for the too long run time, a rushed ending and some awkward tonal shifts that often take you out of the required mood. The rushed ending is particularly galling, after asking the audience to stay with the pic for two hours, it’s not unreasonable to expect a good long and dramatic finale, sadly that’s not the case.

It's not a bad story, and the blind angle allows Bruce Robinson to develop a few more of the sensory perspectives to the usual serial killer drama - with Thurman quite engaging. The rest of the acting talent here is pretty weak, though, as is the writing - lots and lots of it. If it had lost maybe half an hour, the tightened narrative would probably have worked more efficiently - but at over two hours it is all just far too slow a burn, and what efforts are made to generate a sense of menace are undermined by a really bland score and some rather ordinary visuals.

Red Rock West is directed by John Dahl who also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Rick. It stars Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, J. T. Walsh and Timothy Carhart. Music is by William Olvis and cinematography by Marc Reshovsky. 

When a promised job in Wyoming fails to materialise on account of an injury sustained in combat, Michael Williams (Cage) drifts into the town of Red Rock and is mistaken in a bar for a hit-man hired to kill an unfaithful wife. Tempted by the high cash on offer, Michael plays along and promptly finds himself in a web of intrigue from which escape is looking unlikely 

Welcome To Red Rock/You Are Now Leaving Red Rock. 

The studio didn't know what to do with it, a neo-noir flavoured with contemporary Western spices. Put out on cable in America and thriving on its limited release in Europe, it started to gain a cult fan-base. More so after a theatre in the Frisco Bay area started showing it and it made considerable coinage. Today it still remains more of a cult piece than anything else, which while it deserves more accolades and exposure, is still kind of nice for the fans, because it's like we have our own little neo-noir treasure all to ourselves. 

Red Rock West is essential for the neo-noir heads and well worthy of inspection by the average modern day crime film fan. Plot wise it's a bit, shall we say iffy? Yet the twists, turns and characterisations are so deftly constructed and performed, it matters not a jot. Cage's ex- marine is an honest and decent guy who whilst down on his luck - punished for his honesty - finds himself in a vortex of mystery and murder that he can't escape from. His companions in this scenario are film noir staples, the femme fatale (Boyle) with a smoulder as big as her secret, the hit-man (Hopper) with a glint in his eye to accompany his callous leanings, and the shifty bar owner (Walsh) trying to off his wife whilst keeping his shady cards close to his chest. 

As the tricksy plot unfolds in a haze of bad judgements and untruths, further pulsed by the vagaries of fate, it becomes apparent that Dahl wants us to know it isn't taking itself too seriously. There's a glorious scent of dark humour hanging in the air, an unpretentiousness about the whole thing that's refreshing. The look and feel is perfect for the narrative, the colour is stripped back to create a moody atmospheric surround, while the score and sound-tracking immediately brings to mind country and western tales of woe. Dahl knows his noir onions, but this is not just a homage hat tipper to the past, he understands what works in noir, be it the blending of the quirky with the edgy, or scene setting in locales such as a colourless bar and a foggy cemetery, Dahl gets the key ingredients right to deliver the goods wholesale. 

The small cast come up trumps. Boyle as Suzanne Brown is weak if her femme fatale is pitted against the likes of Matty Walker or Bridget Gregory, but it's an adequate performance that doesn't hinder the picture. She is helped enormously, though, by having to share most scenes with Cage who brings his ""A"" game. Consistently inconsistent throughout his career, Cage, when on form is a joy to watch, here he gets to thrive as a put upon hero, shifting seamlessly between confusion and boldness, where incredulous looks are the order of the day with a side order of eccentric intensity. Hopper does what he does so well, amusing villainy, while Walsh is effortlessly menacing and suspicious. In small secondary support Carhart and country star Dwight Yoakam leave favourable impressions. 

This is not an edge of your seat thriller, or a cranium bothering piece of dramedy, it's neo-noir done right. Where morality is grey at best and money is the root of all evil, it's slick, playful, cold blooded and absorbing. Hooray! 9/10",9.0
10428,"God, this movie is bad. And it's so much fun I can hardly stand it. Reasons why you should watch Hackers, in no particular order: 

- A steaming 20-something Angelina Jolie, 
- A bleach-blonde Jonny Lee Miller (hubba hubba),
- An ever awesome Matthew Lillard, who cranked his Lillardness up to 11,
- A duo of DJ/hackers named Razor and Blade (feel free to cry),
- An awesome and totally cliché GenX soundtrack, 
- ""It's 1995 so we have to make an Eddie Vedder reference"" (and it's totally awesome),
- Fisher Stevens who acts out his entire part as if he's on steroids, 
- Did I mention Angelina Jolie? 

Does this movie have any basis in any realm of conceivable realism? Nope. Is this even what actual hacking looks like? Oh puh-lease! Is it everything you could wish for in an hour and a half of pleasurable suspension of disbelief? Absolutely.

10435,"Told by way of a retrospective, this is a stylish and informative - if not always very entertaining - biopic on the legendary film star. He is discussing his autobiography and as he meanders down memory lane, we accompany him from his life in Edwardian London through his journey to the USA where he found fame with Keystone Studios and developed the legendary ""Tramp"" persona that resonated so well with an increasingly poverty-stricken populace. Robert Downey Jnr is effective in the title role, conveying much of the quirkiness - and selfishness - of this character. Geraldine Chaplin (his real life daughter) delivers a poignantly strong, if sparing, contribution and the attention to detail with costumes and sets is special. Thing is, although it must have been hard for Richard Attenborough to condense eighty-eight years of this man's hugely interesting life into one film, those moments he has selected tend a little towards the more salacious; those less demonstrative of his creative genius. The scenes at the start when an opportunity was there to illustrate to us how his workhouse upbringing instilled the ethic that was to drive him all his life - we skip through them all too superficially (though maybe that's because there was no role for Downey?). The political emphasis on the McCarthy witch-hunts is interesting, and the general FBI conspiracy elements are developed well, but for me this is much less about the man than it is about the myth and that's a shame. The supporting cast deliver well enough - John Thaw as his discoverer ""Karno"" and Dan Aykroyd strong amongst them, and to be fair it does rather fly by for almost 2½ hours. I can't help but admire the director's intention to encapsulate such a lot into such a little amount of screen time, but perhaps it was just never really possible in the first place - if justice were ever to be done to this flawed, enigmatic, charming, ruthless and funny man.",7.0

10437,"There are certainly one or two toe-tappers in this enjoyable Muppetisation of the immortal Charles Dickens tale of Christmas humbug and redemption. ""Gonzo"" adopts the role of the author/narrator and guides us through this (pretty heavily) abridged version of the story as Michael Caine's arch-miser ""Ebenezer Scrooge"" is visited by the three kindly spirits on Christmas morning - each trying to point to the errors of his ways and to encourage him to engage a little more with the Christmas spirit. To be honest, I am not a fan of puppets - and these ones never worked for me on television when I was young. This film does, however, deliver well. A combination of very gentle comedy, a strong and emotional story and a star who was certainly up for joining in, all combine well to offer an engaging and colourful take on the story without descending into too much sentiment that ends, fittingly, outside the east London branch of Mickelwhite’s. Paul Williams has composed some frequently poignant lyrics for the ""Scrooge"", ""Bless Us All"" and ""It Feels Like Christmas"" numbers and, mercifully, the more irritating ""Kermit"" and ""Miss Piggy"" characters actually feature quite sparingly as that huge turkey in the butcher in the next street gets ever closer to finding a generous buyer.

10439,"I imagine most of the love for Hocus Pocus comes from people who re-watch it with nostalgia goggles. Even as a child of the 90's I had never seen Hocus Pocus and knew little of it, so I had no prior attachments to this film. If you have seen any of the Disney Channels terrible made for TV movies, Hocus Pocus is like a particularly bad one with some questionable language and sexual innuendo. The acting is really bad from the entire cast, which is a little surprising considering the witches (who I had always assumed you the heroes of the story, but are clearly not) are two D-List actresses (Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy) and a C-lister (Sarah Jessica Parker) who aren't exactly known for their acting abilities, but are actual professional actresses. The CG effects are bad, even considering this is a 1993 movie and the practical effects aren't even an honest effort. All of this could be forgiven if it was part of a fun, campy family movie, but Hocus Pocus can't even pull that off. The plot is lame and full of inconsistencies and just unreasonably unrealistic moments. The witches have been ""dead"" for 300 years, but will be brought back if a virgin lights the black flame candle. In 1990 a high school boy says multiple times publicly that he is a virgin. Let me just say that again, they think a high school boy would go around announcing himself to be a virgin repeatedly to his peers. This is a public high school in Massachusetts in the 90's, not a Mormon town or a private Catholic school. When the witches return, they have been gone for 300 years and don't even know what the paved road is, thinking it to be a river or what a bus is; they have no knowledge of any of the advances since the 1600's. Having established this, one of the witches flies up to the side of a car on their broom and asks him for his license and registration. So, they don't understand asphalt, but they know motorist jokes? The movie is littered with inconsistencies and a wild lack of understanding of how teenagers and children think and act. Even the three witches can't maintain a consistent character. Bette Midler is supposed to be the smart older sister, but she acts the most irrationally and whines like a child. Sarah Jessica Parker is a horny dumb blonde and Kathy Najimy is a mentally challenged woman who barks an talks out of the side of her mouth, but they are always the ones to reason and plan. Najimy is the worst, with her constantly swinging from offensively stupid the brains of the operation. This was an actual movie released in theaters. Had it been a cheap Disney Channel original, it would still be terrible, but excusable. As a real theatrical film, Hocus Pocus is embarrassing. Unless you grew up with this film, I can't imagine you getting much out of this. It's fairly unoffensive children's drivel, with some questionable language if that's all you need, but it's not a good film. It wasn't fun or interesting and it was probably best left in '93.",4.0

Sometimes it is fun to get in the way back machine to visit ""classic"" movies, but they don't always hold up.  And in some cases, like this, it is a wonder they EVER worked at all.  Especially that it is a 1993 Disney movie and focuses on sex, plus a lot of witch lore being based on women being sexual in a time where it was so inappropriate they would be burnt at the stake.  I digress.

While the Sanderson sisters are a compelling premise, if sloppy, and an interesting metaphor for the desires of power, hunger, and sex, it goes to an almost cartoonish levels of ridiculous for next to no reasoning.

All the non witch cast do a fine job, and I especially liked Thora Birch's performance, I can see why she took off so well.  As for the witch cast, I have no doubt they did was in the script very well, but the script is overly ridiculous, and even just trying to relax there are jokes that make no sense and just aren't all that funny.

This was the 90s, it was that time where they could make a children's movie that was still a little dark, a children's movie that was still entertaining for adults to watch. In other words, they made a FAMILY movie, and that hasn't been done lately has it?

You can watch it as an adult and love it because it has a real plot, it has jokes that are above the low brow children's fair, and jokes that cater to them as well. It takes an effort to be appealing to ALL age groups.

And, as I said, it has a plot that you can follow, which again is new for the modern family film which are more or less a series of scenes loosely linked together.

Fresh off his success with “Wayne’s World” (1992), Mike Myers stars as a poet/musician in the Bay Area of California, performing in art houses.

Amanda Plummer plays her sister and Anthony LaPaglia a detective pal of the poet. Debi Mazar has a glorified cameo as the cop’s girlfriend.

“So I Married an Axe Murderer” (1993) is amusing enough to watch at home, but I wouldn’t go out and pay money for it. It’s cute & comical and works up some quality suspense regarding the core question (Is she or isn’t she?) and the writers came up with a worthwhile climax. Enough said.

10445,"**Hopkins and Attenborough in an emotional and feeling-filled work.**

When I decided to see this movie, I knew little about the life of the writer C. S. Lewis, who I only knew from having written the books ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". And I confess that, in order to fully understand the film and also be able to write something about it, I had the curiosity and interest to read one thing or two about him. For example, I was very impressed by his deep connection to the university and his closeness to J. R. R. Tolkien, who is also the author of a great work of fiction. In fact, thinking about it, it is interesting to see how their works share a lot of points of contact, subtle similarities. But that's a thing for another review.

The film focuses on Lewis' life and, especially, on his love relationship with his American wife, Joy Gresham. Lewis was an academic, philosopher and theologian who left many works on these topics, and who unexpectedly decides to marry a recently divorced American, in a union that only later gave way to love between them. The film was inspired by a play, which in turn was inspired by the texts that Lewis wrote about what he experienced and felt.

The best thing about the film, for me, is the direction and the cast performance. The director, Sir Richard Attenborough, was known for his attention to detail, cinematography and choice of locations. Considered by many to be one of the great British film directors, this film leaves us with a work full of elegance and beauty, but which seems to be largely forgotten these days, undoubtedly deserving more attention.

The cast, in turn, is expertly led by Debra Winger and Sir Anthony Hopkins, a duo of actors of great quality and talent. Hopkins does deeply emotional work, in which we can see that he tried to employ a lot of feeling as well as intellect. Winger didn't impress me that much, but the great quality of her work is undeniable, especially in the moments when she plays with Hopkins or with her fictional son, played by a young boy, Joseph Mazello, who also deserves praise for a job well done. The rest of the cast gives the protagonists the necessary support, but does not stand out or stand out.

The film was filmed in Oxford, and we can see how Attenboroug tried to take advantage of the original places, where Lewis would have been and that he surely knew, such as the university and academic spaces. The film gives us an aroma of the atmosphere of the old and renowned institution, and of some of the ceremonies and traditions that take place there. The cinematography is very beautiful and makes the best use of light, close-ups, landscapes and the beauty of old buildings. There are no great effects here, nor does the film need that, but we have an effective soundtrack.",8.0
10446,"I read Poul Anderson's book way back in high school in the 1960's. (The pre-computer, pre-Internet, pre-everything Age!.;) The  idea that a technologically advanced Alien civilization could be tamed, much less conquered by a ""swords-knights-archers"" group was intriguing. The War in Vietnam was about to go from ""advisors and observers"" to ""boots on the ground,"" which resonated with me at the time. I saw this film on DVD and bought it, wondering how this tale played out. The setup was fine, then the spaceship landed at a gate...and went no farther. Did the producers runs out of money or ideas?

It's to that end that she marries off her eponymous daughter, Margaret de Valois to the fairly insipid King Henry of Navarre (Daniel Auteuil). He's a puppet for just about everyone and she has little interest in the marriage from the outset.

Assassinations, poisonings, rapes - nothing is off limits as this story of power-crazed depravity and scheming soldiers on for just over 2½ hours of blood and sweat and - well that, too! Isabel Adjani delivers a career best performance in the title role, but Auteuil and her brother Charles IX (Jean-Hughes Anglade) also help to deliver the thrust of the story well and entertainingly. Beware, it's no history lesson - if you're looking for factual accuracy then you might be wasting your time. It's a scandalous exposure of absolute dynastic rule that treats tragedy and joy with equal short-termism.

If “Dragonheart” managed to make an impact and assert itself as an iconic epic adventure, the same cannot be said of its sequels. In the review I wrote for the initial film, I spoke a little about its popularity and impact… and when a film achieves this effect, it already makes a series of sequels designed to “milk the cow” and monetize the success obtained.

This was the first sequel, and it was so weak that it would have been better not to exist. We already know that sequels are rarely as good as the original movies (although we can name several examples of sequels as good or better than the originals), but this movie is so weak and had such a limited budget that I have doubts about the real effort. from the studio to bring the project to a successful conclusion.

The most praiseworthy and redeeming aspects of this film reside in some of its technical characteristics. In fact, the film has a good soundtrack (in good part a recycling of the first film's musical themes) and tries its best to be fun, engaging, friendly and enjoyable for the whole family. There's plenty of humor, although the jokes don't always work: burning flatulence or drool dripping over a human are situations we've seen before on film, and much better.

Everything else is woefully weak: the script, based on an implausible prophecy and a dragon's egg left behind by Draco, is rather weak and riddled with problems; there are several action-packed scenes, but almost all of them are overly choreographed, imaginative and uninteresting, plus the climax was clearly cobbled together in a hurry. The sets and costumes also suffer from the excesses of imagination applied to the script, turning the Middle Ages into Middle Earth, or almost. There are clearly problems with the lack of good taste in the design of some sets and costumes.

The film used CGI and computer effects quite intensively, both for the castles and the dragon itself. Its use, however, should have been more punctual, since nothing is real, and we clearly understand that. I, for one, don't remember seeing many movies with such clearly fake and amateurish CGI and effects! There are also pacing problems, which reveal faulty editing and many shortcomings in the post-production work.

About the actors, I can only say that we shouldn't hope for miracles. We are dealing with a very weak cast, with weak talent and little able to shine. The main character is the CGI-created dragon, but despite Robby Benson's good voice work, he's a jerk. The best interpretations are by Christopher Masterson and Harry Van Gorkum. Masterson is the classic hero and Gorkum is the Machiavellian villain. What unites them? Both are crooks.",2.0
10476,"Terrence Howard really does put his heart and soul into this gritty story of an aspiring man who wants to leave his pimping days behind him and become an hip-hop MC.

He knows that this is likely to be his last opportunity to escape the cycle of hopelessness he faces, but can he stay focused, on-course and away from crime long enough to prove his worth? The main characterisation of ""Djay"" is strongly portrayed here with guts and a degree of viscerally plausible credibility that really works at times. Sadly, though, the bulk of the rest of it resorts to more aggressive and would mouthed stereotyping that reinforces so many pejorative views of how African American men treat each other and the women (and children) in their lives. It's that very sad predictability that rather ruined the potency of Howard's effort here, and by mid-way through I can honestly say I couldn't have cared less whether he succeeded or not. Too many lives had already been ruined by his previous behaviour, so why should he escape the consequences of a vicious circle he had quite an hand in creating? There's plenty for fans of the musical genre to get their teeth into as that offers a boxing-like conduit for those without academic credentials to use their more creative talents to escape their torpor and find hope.

10478,"Sex and golf are the two things you can enjoy even if you're not good at them.

Directed by Ron Shelton and starring Kevin Costner, Rene Russo and Don Johnson, Tin Cup is the golf rom-com sports movie that even none golf fans (me) can enjoy. Costner is a washed up ex pro golfer who upon happening upon Russo's - eager to please her golfer boyfriend (Johnson) - psychiatrist, finds a new lease of life for the sport and for potential romance. But first he has to deal with the cocky nemesis that is Johnson's star laden showy golfer.

The sports based movie is a tough nut to crack, the margins for narrative worth are thin, there's only so much one can take such a genre to. Here we have one of the staples of said genre, that of a washed up sportsman getting a second shot at glory. It really should have been a bore to rival that of the sport in reality (sorry golfers, I just don't get it), yet Shelton, backed by superb lead actors, creates a thoroughly charming, exciting and thoughtful sports rom-com.

The characterisations are white hot, people you can easily root for, or in the case of Johnson's David Simms, boo and hiss at. It is testament to the director and writers (Shelton and John Norville) that these characters manage to rise above stereotype status, and crucially they are given sharp dialogue to spout. The sport of golf isn't the crux of the matter here, it really is the characters and how they adapt to the changing of basic human emotions that drives this pic forward.

Some famous golfers of the time make appearances, rewardingly so, while the always ace Cheech Marin gets a part he can nail with aplomb. You haven't got to love golf or sports movies in general for this one, it really is just a crowd pleasing delight. 8/10",8.0

10479,"**It had everything to be much better and complex, but it was deliberately simplified to become a courtroom drama with touches of puffed up patriotism.**

I was never in the military, I didn't need to be (I'll be the first to volunteer if my country needs it), but I am the son of an ex-military man, a war veteran with years of combat in Africa. And I know that, when you are in a combat scenario, the rules don't matter, what matters is getting out of there alive, and the concern of an officer with soldiers in his charge is to accomplish the mission with the minimum of casualties, to do the job and come back with all the boys. My father taught me this and told me several stories that prove it, and I'm talking about this now because the film, due to its theme, makes me remember and think about it.

The script begins with a combat in the middle of Vietnam, where an officer, Terry Childers, executes a captured Viet Cong to force the commander of the hostile force, also taken prisoner, to order his men to retreat. That is, he clearly violates a combat rule in order to save the lives of soldiers under his command. Years later, he is sent to Yemen to protect the US embassy, which is surrounded by a hostile mob and under sniper fire. In the evacuation of the embassy, Childers loses three soldiers and sees a fourth comrade fall, mortally wounded, ordering the others to return fire and fire on a crowd killing 83 people. In the following months, however, he is taken to the Military Court and accused of murder and inappropriate conduct of an officer, calling to defend him an old friend from Vietnam, Hays Hodges, who owes him his life for what he did there.

We've had our fair share of movies with military courts and trials, that's not new, and director William Friedkin made the mistake of turning the movie into a simple courtroom drama. The plot is effective in the task of making us doubt Childers' guilt, and leaves the public free to support him or not, but it does so effortlessly, going in simple ways: for example, demonizing politicians and highlighting a cabal. to withhold evidence and force the court to convict him. It is quite obvious that there are powerful people interested in condemning him and using him as a sacrificial lamb to remedy a political and diplomatic imbroglio. Unfortunately, the film does not explore this, it pushes more complex issues out of the way, it never addresses the position of the State Department or even that of the President and everything is simplified, resulting in a film that, despite being entertaining, is quite forgettable.

The cast has a range of excellent actors and very solid credits for the characters they will play. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson have already done other similar jobs and are very safe bets for the two central characters in the plot. However, none of them will one day be remembered for this film. Guy Pearce also does a satisfactory job and within what could be expected from the actor. Ben Kingsley makes a relatively brief appearance and doesn't add much to the film, but the one who really does poorly is Bruce Greenwood. He plays the role of a cabinet politician... yet the character is downright underwritten and is only here to be hated by all of us.

Technically, the film is up to the standards of what I call ""American patriotic films"". It has good cinematography and good effects, a very martial soundtrack, excellent action scenes with good combat moments and, of course, the ubiquitous flag of the USA, revered and protected by the blood of heroic soldiers. Here, without a doubt, we feel the aroma of advertising. The USA is a country that likes to meddle in the affairs of other countries and assumes the role of the planet's police, but it is enough that the polls of the electorate are more adverse than the generals immediately order the withdrawal of troops. We saw the result of all this patriotism in Kabul very recently, but those of us who are older will remember Saigon.",5.0
10480,"**_Oddball dramedy about two people in love with their unreal fantasies_**

A small town waitress in Kansas (Renée Zellweger) is married to a jerk car salesman, but enjoys a soap opera in which she fantasies about the hero-doctor on the show (Greg Kinnear). Meanwhile a criminal duo (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock) chases the woman to Los Angeles whereupon the leader seems to develop a thing for her.

""Nurse Betty"" (2000) is part dramedy, part road movie, part crime drama, part romcom and part black comedy. While it's rarely laugh-out loud, it's pretty consistently amusing. What throws it off is that it's such an eccentric mixture viewers don't know how to take it, especially with a fairly radical scalping sequence (and I don't mean scalping tickets). It helps, though, when you grasp that the movie's about Betty and Charlie and their romantic idealism of people they've never met.

At the end of the day this is an offbeat Tarantino-esque flick that's half-good and half-meh. The ""meh"" reaction is mostly due to its curiosities. Thankfully, it has depth and plays better on repeat viewings.

The movie runs about one hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles; Durango, Colorado; Grand Canyon, Arizona; and Rome, Italy (closing scene).

10481,"Walt Disney's classic film, 101 Dalmatians, may not be completely original as it is based on a previous book, but it has turned its characters into beloved favorites, especially Pongo and Purdy. The movie will make you fall in love with all the adorable puppies like Lucky, Penny, Patch, and Freckles.

The animation is superb with just the right amount of music that doesn't overwhelm the storyline but does give us the memorable song of Cruella Deville. Speaking of the villain, Cruella is an iconic and fantastically over-the-top character, with Horace and Jasper adding to the trio's incredible dynamic.

The film is a delightful experience from start to finish, a complete classic that has been a box office success and is one of Walt Disney's triumphs. Moving forward, the live-action films, 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians, are based on the cartoon and offer a fresh take on the story with Glenn Close's portrayal of Cruella Deville being particularly outstanding.

While the movies may have a few plot holes, they are still top-notch entertainment. The sequel, 101 Dalmatians Part 2 in the Animated Series, focuses on Patch's adventures in London, adding a new dimension to the beloved story. Although the animated series may not reach the same heights as the original or the movies, it is still worth a watch for fans of the franchise.

Stephen King’s Cujo was brought to the screen and met with indifference back in 1983, yet it’s aged surprisingly well and comes out as one of the better “mad animal” movies that followed in the wake of Jaws.

A big cuddly St. Bernard dog is bitten on the nose by a bat, cops a serious bout of Hydrophobia and then terrorises anyone in its path. Which spells bad news for Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace) and her young son Tad (Danny Pintauro), who have the misfortune to be stuck in a battered old Pinto that has broken down in Cujo’s territory.

Lewis Teague directs with no little skill here, wringing out pot loads of tension and inserting genuine moments of terror as mother and son literally fight for their lives. There’s a school of thought that the film’s first half could have been trimmed, for this is the area that defines the Trenton’s as a family. 

Donna has been having an affair and her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) has found out, so for forty minutes we are investing in family strife and foundation building of the key characters. This is judged perfectly, because once Cujo is unleashed on Donna and Tad, it throws up a number of emotional connections to not only the humans, but also the dog as well.

Wallace and Pintauro are excellent, providing the film with its beating heart as they prove to be a believable mother & son pairing. Teague meanwhile uses some invention with his camera work, though never to the detriment of claustrophobic terror. Elements of the source novel have been left out, while the ending – unfortunately in this viewer’s opinion – has been changed, but this is a tightly wound horror and it’s well due re-evaluation in this day and age of franchise sequels and remakes.

Dead Calm is directed by Phillip Noyce and adapted to screenplay by Terry Hayes from the novel of the same name written by Charles Williams. It stars Sam Neill, Nicole Kidman and Billy Zane. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Dean Semler.

After losing their young son in a car accident, John (Neill) and Rae Ingram (Kidman) head out alone on their yacht for an ocean vacation. Whilst taking in some R&R, the couple spy a ship drifting in the distance, then a man in a dinghy hurriedly rows towards them. He boards their yacht, frantic and panicked, he tells them the ship is sinking and that all on board are dead, killed by food poisoning. His name is Hughie Warriner (Billy Zane), and the Ingram's are about to wish they had never met him....

The Saracen and The Orpheus.

It's so refreshing to find a thriller that works without tricks or elaborate plotting, where the narrative is stripped down to the bare bones and played out purely by three characters. Dead Calm, whilst not exactly the most credible of thrillers from the 80s, contains genuine suspense, a pot boiling heart and production value of some distinction. Director Noyce deals in psychological studies, primarily that of a lunatic and that of a woman beset with grief having to use her mental fortitude to hopefully save herself and her husband.

Noyce and his team get the maximum amount of edge of the seat thrills from a small isolated yacht in the middle of a vast ocean, with tight camera work and nifty editing, it's a film of quality that belies its pared back production. Even ace Aussie photographer Semler (previously Mad Max 2/Razorback, latterly Dances With Wolves/Waterworld) creates beauty out of such a sparse set up, where the blues and greens of the ocean warm the soul and the red sunsets please the eyes. They be glimpses of Mother Earth that give the Ingram's something tangible to fight for.

With the plot requiring Neill to be in his own isolated hell, he turns in a more measured performance, perfect in fact, but it's Zane and Kidman who steal the show. This would prove to be the launching point of Kidman's career, and it hints at the top actress she would become. She gives Rae Ingram a real strength through adversity, with energy in abundance, intelligence and a simmering sexuality, she's a lady character earning respect by film lovers because of Kidman's performance. Zane is suitably edgy, very much giving Hughie a man-child persona, he too exudes a dangerous sexuality, and when it inevitably kicks off, he is scary into the bargain.

A couple of daft character decisions within the story, and a WTF finale, stop it from being near the top of the thriller movie pantheon. But it's not far off from sitting with the best and it remains fresh and entertaining as the decades roll by. 8/10",8.0

10494,"Perfect Blue perfectly blends psychologically disturbed fantasy with grounded reality. Mima Kirigoe. A pop-idol. An actress. An X-rated model. Public image and its personifying echoes circulate around the world, adhering to the desires of endearing fans alike. But when their inspirational idol haphazardly shifts career, from pop sensation to dramatic actress, the psychosis of the modern consumer society ultimately changes with her. Saddened, angered and crazed. Mima’s abrupt persona altering career move may have developed maddened stalkers, including her fantastically imagined past self haunting the newly suppressed version.

The late Satoshi Kon was known for seamlessly blending fantasy with reality. Depicting an opaque blurred line between delusions and actualities. None more so, than in his exaggerated psychologically disturbed work in Perfect Blue. For many the art form of Japanese animation, commonly titled as “anime”, is cited as “childish”. “Anime is for losers” tweeted kickboxer Andrew Tate. Well, if like Mr. Tate you believe anime to be childish, I implore you to watch Perfect Blue. Without illustrating the voyeuristic nature of Murai’s narrative, it is the most accessibly invigorating piece of psychological stimulation, that is strictly aimed towards adults, to ever be constructed from this art form.

The complete metamorphosis of a character that questions her own perceived identity through inquisitional explicit acts of graphic nature. Exploring the psychosis of shared delusional disorder and the acute harassment of an obsessive stalker. Kon establishes a murder mystery whilst inciting the emasculation of a vulnerable female’s world. Male controllers, likened to manipulative deities of authoritative powers, are gradually weakened by a mysterious individual. Culminating into a twistingly fragmented climax that grants Mima the independence that she was repressed from.

Kon’s intelligence in foreshadowing, the drama series ‘Double Bind’ essentially replicating Mima’s regressive state of mind, allows the audience to question several aspects. He smartly manages to maintain the central mystery without deterring from Mima’s mental instability. He doesn’t stop there though. Kon refuses to relinquish thematic presence in every frame. Exploring the fragility of a rape victim and the traumatisation of such an explicitly heightened ordeal. The dangers of online anonymity and the tarnishing of existing careers. Challenging the extremities of art in all its mediums. The realism of Perfect Blue is what forces its story to be so utterly terrifying. It’s not just a psychological thriller. It’s horror.

Kon’s signature animation style is gloriously vibrant as always, with attentive detail towards realistic environments. The grotesque facial features of “Me-Mania”, only possible in this art form, heighten the natural malformed detest we have for him. Ikumi’s audacious score enables the heart to palpitate more frequently with its sharp tones and ethereal voices. And, as rare as this is, the English dub is surprisingly decent.

The reality is that Perfect Blue transcends the medium that it is presented in. It stimulates through Kon’s trademark visceral style, allowing the dangers of early Internet culture to produce a thrilling psychologically adept feature that blurs fantasy with reality. I mean, for a film to make me stand up, clap my hands and utter the words “perfection”, it has to be something special right?. Well, Perfect Blue is special, because it is perfect. And yes, with that said it does indeed garner the perfect rating. Quite possibly the best anime feature to ever be released.",10.0

Like so many other impressionable young folks, she tries to follow her dream - but is really only following his, and is soon being photographed (intimately), denigrated and her grasp on reality is soon compromised. When things start to take an altogether more sinister turn, though, we start to wonder just who is responsible for a series of murders amongst those known to hold disparaging views on the young woman. Might she be developing some form of lethal schizophrenia or is she (and are they) really the victims of an over-zealous fan. At times this is actually quite harrowing. The plundering of her innocence by those both venal and neglectful of this young woman is writ large and is really quite depressing to watch.

After an excellent initial film and a sufficiently honorable sequel, this film comes to us… and there is no way to hide that the quality of the material presented is substantially lower and that the film works badly.

The biggest problem with this film is the script, quite weak, poorly written and full of holes in which the lack of logic and credibility are closely associated with a dose of predictability that makes the film tiresome. The characters were also frankly poorly developed, the villains are stereotyped and loaded (the movie does everything it can to not like them) and the material given to the actors wasn't enough to guarantee a good job.

Even so, it is necessary to recognize that Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio did everything possible to rise to the challenge, and to live up to what the audience expected from their respective characters. Morita remains a sympathetic presence and Macchio is not as immature and stubborn as in previous films, which shows some maturity in the character (although I don't know if this was intentional). The disappearance of Macchio's character's mother from the scene is justified in the most stupid way possible, and the place that was supposedly leased for the bonsai shop looks more like a warehouse than a commercial space.

In the midst of these problems, the film compensates us with regular cinematography, good editing, a pleasant pace and no room for dead moments. Filming locations are satisfying enough. This being an action movie, a fight movie, karate, I expected to have seen some more fights, it has a lot less fights than the previous movies, and the tension is not as palpable, but what was done is quite well done, and the fight choreographies were well rehearsed and carried out.",5.0

Anyway, it also has Ralph Macchio doing a job that kind of makes sure to tell the audience that he does not want to be there, he does not think III is a good idea, and otherwise convinces the audience not to like it.

A remake of Luc Besson's Nikita, this was always going to suffer the usual remake taunts of why bother? Was it necessary etc? Point of No Return is a good honest action movie, it has style to burn, nifty photography and likable leading actors. The action is well staged and thrilling - and Hong Kongish in style, and bubbling away in the writing are themes of identity, absent parents and a delicately off-kilter oedipal angle. The Nina Simone soundtrack is terrific, while Zimmer works around Nina's songs with an aural assuredness that grabs the attention.

It doesn't push any boundaries, and although it has been noted in some neo-noir circles, it is only a borderline entry in that style of film making.

""The Man without a Face"" was Mel Gibson's 1993 debut as director. Gibson stars in the eponymous role as McLeod, a man whose face is heavily scarred. The story takes place on coastal Maine during the summer of 1968. Several years earlier McLeod moved to the area to live in seclusion and do his unconventional work with the requisite privacy. Unfortunately, but to be expected, rumors about the mysterious recluse circulate amongst the locals, who callously refer to him as ""hamburger head."" A fatherless 12 year-old, Chuck (Nick Stahl), wants to go to a military school and therefore enlists the aid of the outcast and a good relationship develops. Margaret Whitton plays Chuck's oft-married mother while Fay Masterson and Gaby Hoffmann his half-sisters. Geoffrey Lewis is on hand as the town's police chief.

I saw this movie years ago and, despite it being a decent drama, it left a sour taste. Why? Four reasons and they all have to do with the third act: 

**1.** It introduces the rumor of a hideous crime where someone is falsely accused (LIKELY falsely accused) and plots like this infuriate me for obvious reasons.
 
**2.** The crime in question is sexual molestation, which is always an uncomfortable and awkward topic, to say the least. 

**3.** There's a scene where a character is given the opportunity to affirm or deny the wicked allegations and he refuses; instead he answers by asking a rhetorical question. This is also frustrating. If someone didn't commit a crime then he (or she) should JUST SAY SO. 

**4.** Another scene struck me as stoo-pid simply because intelligent, discerning people are careful (and responsible) to make sure that what they do doesn't have the ""appearances of evil"" even though it's not evil, if you know what I mean. The character in question fails to do this and it was, again, infuriating.

Watching the film a second time, I have much higher respect for it because I now see what it's really about. The plot reveals the surface meaning – a fatherless kid finds a much-needed father-figure and a lonely outcast is blessed with human acceptance and the opportunity to fulfill his calling (teaching) – but the movie goes much deeper than this, which explains the existence of the third act and why everything else leads up to it. The subtext is a condemnation of gossipy lowlifes found in every community who destroy lives with their wicked tongues; that is, IF they're not called to account. They're judge, jury & executioners of innocent people. Their prey-of-choice is unconventional types or those perceived as a threat due to their figurative strength. Such slanderers are arrogant fools who love tearing others down, particularly those outside of their group. They feed on creating strife through lies, half-truths, negative spinning, unjust criticism, name-calling and mocking. THEY are the true monsters, not people like McLeod.

The more extreme the nature of the accusation the better, which is why these scum shoot for the most hideous of lies, such as sexual molestation. Such ignoble gossips are literally everywhere and their slander will spread and poison others' minds IF someone doesn't boldly put a stop to their lies. There's an effective scene at the end where the accused person approaches an elderly couple with whom he had a good relationship, but it's clear that the rumors had gotten to them and their minds are now poisoned because they refused to hear his defense before drawing a damning conclusion. There was nothing he could do and it's heartbreaking. Unfortunately, this kind of thing happens all the time.

While the drama of the film is solid, not great, it's the movie's subtext that breaks the threshold of greatness. The awesome coastal locations are a plus, as is the peripheral cast. While the movie's laden by the sexual molestation subplot it's justified because it ties into the picture's potent theme.

The film runs 115 minutes and was shot on coastal Maine and Nova Scotia.

GRADE: B+

**SPOILER ALERT!** Don't read further unless you've seen the movie.

I've heard some seriously erroneous claims about the movie, like McLeod really did have a sexual relationship with Chuck. Nonsense. These people didn't pay attention because the movie itself thoroughly disproves such claims: First of all, there's no scene where sexual abuse is even hinted at. Secondly, when the mother asks Chuck if McLeod ""touched"" him he responds with a shrug, ""Yeah, why?"" In other words, he touched him only in appropriate ways, like a pat on the back and so forth. ""What's the big deal?"" is essentially his response. 

Furthermore, Chuck tries to find out the truth about McLeod upon hearing the gossip/rumors and then steals his mother's car and goes straight to McLeod's house in a frenzy to confront him. McLeod's not the type to TELL people what to believe so he asks Chuck (paraphrasing), ""Have I ever done anything remotely questionable or abusive when you were around me?"" It's a rhetorical question and the non-verbal response is ""Absolutely not."" 

This explains why McLeod had no worries when the police officer came to his house earlier in the story looking for Chuck after he was missing for a night. He nonchalantly responds, ""Yes, he's here; he's sleeping upstairs."" He had no worries BECAUSE nothing improper was going on. Be that as it may, their friendship ends for legal reasons and McLeod moves away, but he secretly attends Chuck's graduation 7 years later at the military school where they happily wave to each other from a distance, hardly the appropriate behavior if McLeod committed an atrocious sex crime against the youth years earlier.",7.0

10513,"**Miserably memorable.**

This is one of those movies that, without a doubt, is bad. More than just being bad, it is an object of study for any apprentice filmmaker, because almost everything that could go wrong actually went wrong.

The problems begin with Ed Wood's utterly incompetent direction. My cat is the best movie director. Inattentive, careless and incapable, Wood simply lets everyone else do their jobs at their own risk. Wood doesn't seem to be concerned with any question of continuity (days and nights seem to happen at random, props appear and disappear several times), he allows us to calmly see the filming material (cameras, microphones, light equipment, etc.) until the cardboard headstones in his cemetery fall, so obviously fake it's incredible they were used in a movie. And I'd rather not mention the flying saucers, which are obviously children's toys hanging from transparent threads, probably maneuvered by fishing rods!

The script is, of course, another problem, giving us one of the most fanciful and clearly false stories that science fiction has ever seen: unpleasantly mixing vampires, undead and aliens, we feel that we just need to find Tarzan, Donald Duck, two or three cowboys and a family from Minnesota on vacation, having a barbecue in the cemetery. The imagination is the limit! And the dialogue? The film is an unstoppable source of jokes and memorable phrases, the result of the childish and idiotic way in which everything was written.

The cast brings together a series of names well known to most of the public, not because they are good actors, but because they have played important and notable roles at certain moments. This is the case of Maila Nurmi, the eternal Vampira, who doesn't say a single word and does little more than stare at us and the other characters.

10514,"Frighteningly absorbing piece of fiction that's fused with fact.

A satellite from the SCOOP project has crashed into the desert town of Piedmont, the SCOOP project basically entails that the satellite scoops outer space for any alien micro-organisms. After the crash all the residents of Piedmont are killed with the exception of a baby and an old gentleman booze hound. Mankind is on the verge of being destroyed by a leaked alien virus, so a crack team of scientists are gathered in the hope of containing and understanding the virus before the world gets devoid of human life! 


Taken from the novel by Michael Crichton, this film is a wonderful lesson in tension building as we follow the scientists through a carefully structured sci-fi plot that will eventually become a race against time thriller. What makes The Andromeda Strain stand out against other genre pieces is the astute and believable approach to the subject matter, we are (in the main) in the presence of proper scientists. There's no super hero tricks forthcoming from these people, these are sensible honest intelligent folk using their combined knowledge to hopefully save the planet? A masterstroke from the makers is that they used largely unknown actors for the film, this gives the story an added grounded believable factor, thus a very useful way of drawing the audience into the drama unfolding. The direction from Robert Wise is very clued in for serio narrative drive, the set design for the underground research facility is top notch, and the actors all give stoic and intelligent performances. 


However, it's not without a niggle, for after the excellence of the films first two thirds, it's disappointing to find that the final act reverts to type, which somehow seems misplaced given what the viewer has just been through. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine sequence of events that fuels the dramatic slant, but it comes off as just a bit too glossy in light of the preceding structure. Still, The Andromeda Strain is an intelligent, smart, mature, and knowing film that is standing the test of time for being a great piece of science fiction cinema. 8/10",8.0
10518,"As a man who quite literally loathes the very idea of a dentist, let alone actually going to visit one - this film adds an extra dimension of ghastliness to the already fairly hideous underlying premiss.

Well, he sets out to investigate and before long is embroiled in a nazi-hunting plot to track down ""Szell"" (Sir Laurence Olivier) who is, himself, trying to stay one step ahead of some government agents whilst he tries to track down an huge cache of diamonds. It turns out that this evil creature thought the now deceased brother knew the location of the gems, and of course that puts ""Babe"" in quite considerable peril and so soon, he is next on the interrogation list. This torture gives the idea of getting a drilling an whole new meaning, as the sound of the dental whirring does more than enough to compensate for the lack of actual visuals. Though the ending is fitting, I found it all just a bit too convenient, but Hoffman is superb here, as are Sir Laurence and an international cast that add depth to this really quite disturbing plot. Even now, when we are so much more used to graphic violence and gore on screen, this is potently gruesome and effective.",7.0
10523,"Eeeehhhhh! I still don't know how to feel about this, and it's been a decade since I first watched it.

And then there is the bias that will certainly seep through. I really hate the DNC in 2018...but in the '00's and still today, well, W. was to me what Nixon was to Hunter S. Thompson. There is literally no president I like less than W. So excuse the bias that may pop up here, I try to keep politics out of these in this insanely political age.

So, on one hand (and I have been ripping into Stone lately) this is a SOLID Oliver Stone film. Unlike Snowden and World Trade Center, it actually has what you expect from an Oliver Stone film. And I can't not like that.

Agree with Stone's politics or not...you go to see an Oliver Stone film because he can leave his mark on it...and this has that mark.

So you can sit down and watch it and have that clear ""I'm watching an Oliver Stone movie"" feeling, and that is always enjoyable when you can do that.

But then, it's been a decade since its release and that kind of mutes it. When it came out in 2008, W was still in office and just going to see it made you proud to be an American. Hardly any other country would allow someone to release a film critical of the CURRENT leader while he was still in office. It gave you a great ""this is what makes America great"" feeling, ""this is what puts us above the rest of the world. Thank you Oliver Stone.""

But, it's been a decade, so you don't get that feeling from watching it now. You don't feel compelled to buy your ticket, and then go back and see it again to celebrate the 1st Amendment.

And because of that, a decade later, it kind of makes you feel that it should have been released now instead of then.

A decade later you remember the people that were celebrating in the streets when he was finally out. You remember that sense of relief that NOT Bush was in office. You remember the Obama victory...you remember the St. Paul horror, and the sense that the DNC could have run a rotting corpse and won.

And then, after you remember all of that, you get the feeling that it would have made a better ending if Stone just waited a year to make the film.

But despite all of that, it was a fair film. It was balanced (unlike this review) and that's probably because of what my late father used to say, he hated W. as a president, but felt he'd like him as a person. Which, unfortunately, is an attitude you're regrettably not allowed to have today.

But that doesn't change the fact that you still feel like you are watching an Oliver Stone movie. It doesn't change the feeling of pride you got by going to see W. in the theaters when it was released. It doesn't change the fact that it is still a good movie...even if it's a better movie for the people that are old enough to remember it.",10.0

In Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) & Dr. Watson (Jude Law) enter into a clash of wits and brawn with a serial killing Lord involved in black magic who, apparently, has risen from the dead (Mark Strong). Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly play the women in the protagonists’ lives. 

Directed by Guy Ritchie, “Sherlock Holmes” (2009) takes Arthur Conan Doyle’s popular Victorian detective and successfully morphs him into an action hero with rapid-fire dialogues and over-the-top thrills. It’s like an old Hammer flick on steroids, but it works as long as you can keep up with the snappy dialogues, which are often mumbled by Downey Jr. (so you’ll have to listen closely or use the subtitles).

The interesting thing about the character of Sherlock Holmes is his talent for making sweeping deductions based on the slightest details and this flick highlights that to amusing effect, like when Holmes easily assesses Watson’s fiancé at the restaurant (which is one of the movie’s best scenes). Speaking of the ladies, both Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly really shine here.

10537,"I KNOW I'm giving way too many stars for this, but I don't care; The Doors were one of my very first favourite groups. I fondly recall, when I was 11, and Elektra Records released 'The Doors' Greatest Hits', and the album-length version of 'Light My Fire' was played all the time on the radio, and I was mesmerized by the instrumental middle of the song, got the album from my parents for Christmas, and started a lifelong love affair with the band. Yes, Jim Morrison is highly overrated. Yes, the movie is an extremely self-indulgent mess and it can be quite incoherent and incohesive. But the Sixties, the L.A. rock scene back then, and especially Morrison's life, were just like that, so it is oh so fitting!

I adore the fact that it was Oliver Stone's labour of love (one of thankfully many) and that the surviving members of the band basically had full input. I would take this and 'Talk Radio' (my personal favourite Stone's throw) over a hundred of Stone's politically over-the-top movies any day!

When I was 17, I took my life savings and visited, on my own, nine European countries, including France and its capital, Paris. Did I go for the Eiffel Tower, wild romance on Richard Linklater-esque trains, or its outstanding magic and sidewalk cafes? No--train-wise I had to put up with a stupid labour strike, such that an overnight sleeper car from Berne, Switzerland to Paris had to be switched, in the middle of the night, FOUR times, just so they could prove a point. And it was just to see Morrison's grave. I met 20 fantastic people who had made the pilgrimage from all over the world, and it was my first time having red wine and smoking pot. The graffiti and the sculpture of him, in the Pere Lachaise cemetery, were fascinating, as was his life. Would I go through that again? Of course I would.

It's Val Kilmer's best work by a mile. The film just oozes charisma and breathes life--just as the band's work must have done back in the day. Worth a purchase and re-watches (I watch it each year on Jim's birthday and accidentally bought it twice), for any fan of 60's music or its culture. A bonafide classic when Stone was actually really something.",9.0
10537,"A hypnotic film, but it emphasizes the negative side of Jim Morrison and is filled with fabrications.

RELEASED IN 1991 and directed by Oliver Stone, “The Doors” chronicles the Southern California band The Doors and their rise and fall between 1966-1971. The film focuses on charismatic singer Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) who falls into alcoholism and drug-addiction. He flew to France in March, 1971, to join his girlfriend, Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan), and pursue a different career, but died the next summer due to his ongoing substance abuse. The other band members are played by Kyle MacLachlan (Ray Manzarek), Frank Whaley (Robby Krieger) and Kevin Dillon (John Densmore).

I'm not old enough to remember The Doors. The first time I heard of them was when my older brother asked me if I knew of them. I busted out laughing saying, ""The Doors? Why don't they just call themselves The Window Sills."" Yeah, I thought the name was pretty lame until I discovered Morrison's reasoning behind it:

There is what is known; And there is what is unknown; In between are the doors

Another thing that won my respect was their song that was used in the opening of “Apocalypse Now,” which is my all-time favorite film (the original version, not ""Redux""). After that I bought their ""Best Of"" album and my impression was that their sound was horribly dated, even THEN. Over time, however, I've come to respect The Doors' music because it's so unique. They don't sound like anyone else. They have a weird, moody vibe, even their 'hits,’ augmented by a strange carnival feel. Over top of it all is Morrison's commanding and haunting vox. I prefer their more artistic songs like ""Riders on the Storm"" and ""The End"" as opposed to their 'hits,' but who can deny the catchiness of ""Light My Fire"" or the goofy charm of ""People are Strange""?

The film focuses on Jim Morrison and leaves the viewer with the impression that he was a miserable artistic-genius type who had no sense of moderation; he sought to escape his personal struggle through loose sex, substance misuse and rock 'n' roll. His excessive self-abuse eventually spilled over to those closest to him and ultimately landed him in a premature grave. His body lies in Paris, a mecca to his fans who have spray-painted the surrounding monuments with gaudy graffiti, some of it profane. The image this leaves you with is that Jim Morrison is no fun to be around, even in death.

So “The Doors” is pretty much the ultimate story of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Stone said he based his view of Morrison, as depicted in the film, on 160 transcripts of people that actually knew him or were around him and the band. From these documents emerged a central truth about Morrison's final years, an image of wild excess. Because of this, I was left with a bad impression of the man. I felt Morrison was a spaced-out, immature jerk, abusive to both himself and others, foolishly sacrificing his life and talents on the altar of alcohol & drug idolatry.

Yet this was only part of the truth. Thankfully the 37-minute documentary on the 'extras' disc, ""The Road to Excess"" (1997), balances things out. One of Morrison's sweethearts, wiccan Patricia Kennealy (played by Kathleen Quinlan in the movie), the guitarist and another guy offer the other side of the story. They properly point out that Stone's film only shows Jim's 'wild & crazy' side, emphasizing that the events depicted in the picture, while sometimes true, aren't ""all that happened."" They unanimously describe Morrison as genuine, innocent, shy, loving and gallant, an amazing person who made those around him feel important, as if he was their best friend. Robby even states that Jim was ""the most influential person I've ever met.""

In addition, the documentary features numerous clips of Morrison himself, clearly showing him to be a fun-loving, nice and sane person rather than the spaced-out, abuse-driven dude shown in the film. Needless to say, the documentary helps round-out one's image of the man.

BOTTOM LINE: Val Kilmer doesn't just play Jim Morrison, he IS Jim Morrison. This is no small feat and vital to the film in light of the fact that he appears in practically every frame. He should have won an award. In any case, if you're in the mood for something that captures that late-60s counter-culture vibe “The Doors” is worth checking out, but it tends to exaggerate things in the name of mythmaking, which is usually the case with movies. For instance, Jim never lit up a closet door with Pamela locked inside (rolling my eyes), the idiotic Thanksgiving dinner sequence never happened and the naked revelries at concerts (and the bonfire) are overblown fabrications.  Still, the movie’s mesmerizing in a spaced-out way and highlighted by The Doors' music throughout. 

Unfortunately, the first half is superior to the second half, which becomes too unpleasant, offering a very limited and unflattering impression of Morrison. That's why it's essential to also watch ""The Road to Excess"" on the bonus disc or, better yet, the excellent 2009 documentary “The Doors: When You’re a Stranger,” which exclusively uses footage and photos from 1966-1971. Another problem with Stone’s movie is that it loses its dramatic pull in the second half in preference for hypnotic yet chaotic visual mayhem, not to mention outright lies.    

Lastly, in “The Road to Excess” Oliver Stone makes a couple of really asinine statements. Commenting on Morrison, he states: ""To live life intensely and well and die young and achieve everlasting fame & glory is the greatest. It's Achilles, it's Alexander, it's... Jim Morrison."" Huh? Another dubious line is: ""The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom."" Is he on drugs? Jim's road of excess led straight to an early grave, not enlightenment.

Cue quips, kicks and death defying tricks as Cutter strikes one for the good guys. Kevin Hooks' film works well enough on a very basic actioner level, due in the main to Snipes. Snipes was six years away from his signature role in Blade, and for sure he is a bona fide action star. As evidenced here, he has the charisma and body motions to carry the film thru its turgid script. It's a script that smacks of the writers sitting round a table and suggesting they put Snipes in a number of tricky situations and used that as an excuse for him to beat the crappola out of everyone. Oh and lets not forget the forced love story waiting to happen as well.

Ultimately it's just a lazy film that is the cash in that many realised it was upon its release. Bruce Payne manfully tries to make the unbalanced Charles Rane truly evil, but doesn't succeed. Liz Hurley, goddess of womanhood that she is, looks uncomfortable holding a gun, while leading lady Alex Datcher is hopelessly out of her depth. While the youthful looking Tom Sizemore and Bruce Greenwood also appear - but both are throwaway characters that you end up wishing we had had more of.

Fear is directed by James Foley and written by Christopher Crowe. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William Petesen, Alyssa Milano and Amy Brenneman. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Thomas Kloss.

One of the number of psycho-sexual thrillers that surfaced in the 80s and 90s, Fear has the narrative hook that it involves teenagers. Witherspoon is the girl who invites drifter David McCall (Wahlberg) into her life, only to find he’s as unstable as unstable can be. Director Foley and his team then produce a film that pretty much cribs from a number of other similar themed movies. All of the key scenes will be instantly familiar to genre film watchers, and unfortunately the plot twists and turns come as no surprise.

However, in spite of the lack of originality in structure and narrative thrust, Fear is never dull, not even when Wahlberg is wistfully looking into Witherspoon’s eyes like a love sick puppy. Suspense is on hand for the big finale, which unfolds with kinetic brutality, and it’s also nice here to find that some thought has gone into the characterisations of those in peril. Kloss’ photography around the various Seattle locales is vividly appealing, as is Burwell’s music compositions, while the acting performances are all on the good side of good, with nobody harming the balance of the piece.

The Australian Robin Hood? Well not quite, but Ned Kelly’s name and exploits live on for ever more. As is often the case with film’s of this type, such as Braveheart, it’s best to approach them as interpretations of real events and people, than actual historical facts. The core basis of Ned Kelly the man is here, and the picture built around him is handsomely mounted. Also ripe with strong character portrayals by the key actors (fluctuating accents and dodgy beards aside) and shot through with enough lyrical smarts by Jordan, it’s a film big on atmosphere and authentic feel.

However, obviously hamstrung by budget and running time etc, much of the story feels incomplete. There’s also the problem of under using Geoffrey Rush, who although playing a key character in the Kelly legend, is only on the periphery of things. Still, the evident problems can’t stop it from being an engaging piece of entertainment. It’s consistently beautiful to look at, Badelt’s mournful musical score is an absolute cracker and the action is well staged by the passionate Jordan.

It's violent but not brutal - we are shown a side of Kelly that has been driven to the course of action and although he doesn't exactly hate it; he has scruples. The detail is good; we get a sense of the relative squalor in which they lived, and the writing and direction are taut and well paced.

10545,"This is what you might call a ""free"" adaptation of Victor Hugo's early 19th century tale of 15th Century French evil, bigotry, fear and love. ""Quasimodo"" is a young gypsy baby seized in Paris by the evil Justice Minister ""Frollo"". After the timely intervention of the Archdeacon, he is put in the care of the church at the imposing Notre Dame cathedral and grows into manhood - largely ridiculed for his hunchback appearance - charged with ringing the bells. During the annual Festival of Fools, ""Quasimodo"" takes part, wins and is crowned - much to the annoyance of the Minister who has him flogged. This is where the charming and mysterious ""Esmerelda"" comes to his rescue and to avoid the pursing ""Capt. Phoebus"" seeks sanctuary in the church. ""Frollo"" is besotted with the young girl and mobilises every resource at his disposal to capture her for himself. ""Phoebus"" is also smitten, and as soon as he realises his boss is a nasty piece of work tries to help her too - leading to a tiny bit of a love rivalry between the soldier and her protector. The film is fun, the animation well crafted and the script is clever and witty. The songs are way too slushy, however - and there are too many unnecessary characters (i.e. the Gargoyles) but it builds well to an exciting denouement with good vocal stuff from Tom Hulce (""Quasimodo""); Demi Moore (""Esmeralda""); Tony Jay (""Frollo"") and Kevin Kline (""Phoebus"").

10549,"Without a doubt, Branagh's film of **HAMLET** is the most ambitious Shakespeare film to date.  He goes all in on.. well, everything.
  
He brings aboard a stellar all-star cast, too many to highlight all, but includes Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and Jack Lemmon - none of which are known for their Shakespearian pedigree. Branagh takes on Hamlet, the largest role in all of Shakespeare - and most English language literature.  His interpretation is - not surprisingly - brilliant and worthy of study.  Kate Winslet plays his challenged love Ophelia, and Derek Jacobi is the fraudulent King.  Rounding out the largest roles, Julie Christie is the doomed queen and Richard Briers is the fussy Polonius. All excellent in their handle of the language and expression of humanity.

Much of the film takes place inside the castle of Elsinore, a gorgeous and regal stage set lined with mirrors to challenge each individual's intentions and a chess-board floor to accentuate the challenge in the royal battle for checkmate.  The Elsinore grounds are widespread and scenes in the snow covered Danish mountains all shown in glorious 65mm film... an extremely detailed film stock that was rarely used because of the extreme expense and cumbersome camera size.

With **HENRY V** and **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING**, Branagh has proven he is a master of adapting Shakespeare's long form story into much more manageable American movie length.  Well, here he goes all in and captures the 4 hour play in its uncut full length.  The film was shown with a 15 minute intermission.

**HAMLET** itself is doubtlessly one of the most intelligent character studies ever written by any author, and Branagh does a great job recording that. Even many other productions of the show do as good a job or even better job in relaying that story.

10568,"**A little forgotten gem that, perhaps, deserved to be revisited by the public.**

This film is one of several adaptations of a novel set during the Anglo-Egyptian conquest of Sudan. It's quite good and must have been a ""super production"" for the time it was made. Very well directed by Zoltan Korda, in a luxurious and meticulous production that spared no effort or expense, it is, perhaps, one of the best film adaptations of the title novel. And yet, it is unjustly forgotten!

For those who don't know or don't remember, the interior of the African continent was only colonized after the Berlin Conference, in 1885. Fourteen countries participated in it, including the USA and European countries without any colonies, such as Sweden. Among the several issues addressed (the end of slave trade, freedom of navigation on some rivers and the trade liberalization in some coastal areas), the legal bases for the occupation of the African interior were discussed: of course, for the Europeans at that time, the rights of the native tribes had no value, they were just savages. Outrageous today, but understandable in light of that time.

As a result, the main European empires rushed to send expeditions with a view to exploring and demarcating their territories in Africa. The United Kingdom wanted the possession of a considerable strip of land, between Cairo and Cape Town, which is why it was decided to control Egypt, then a semi-independent kingdom under the authority of the Sultan of Istanbul, which had conquered the Sudan decades earlier. After helping the Egyptian king, Tewfik Pasha, to survive an uprising, the British took factual control of the kingdom. However, in 1881, the Egyptians lost control of Sudan to an Islamic revolutionary movement led by a self-appointed prophet, the Mahdi. The uprising withstood several military expeditions, leading to the death of the popular General Charles Gordon.

The film begins with these events and historical context. It is when the relief expedition to Sudan is being prepared that the protagonist, Harry Faversham, asks to be discharged from service in the regiment where he is an officer. He never wanted to be a soldier, he was forced by his father and he was finally released from that obligation with his death. However, his comrades in arms and his bride did not understand that, and Faversham found himself in possession of four white feathers, a symbolic insignia given to men considered cowards for not serving their country in the ranks.

John Clements is very good in the lead role, giving his character a dose of nobility and generosity combined with the youth and courage he comes to discover. Ralph Richardson, Jack Allen and Donald Gray were impeccable in the roles of British officers who demarcate themselves from the protagonist's attitude. June Duprez has little to do here, but what she does is done very well.

On a technical level, we have to highlight Korda's direction, who had the close collaboration of his brothers on this project. The cinematography is simply magnificent and the colors, in their brightness and intensity, are a feast for the eyes. The director's meticulousness and exactness greatly benefited the historical accuracy, which was one of his concerns and the ultimate reason why he decided to film a lot of fight scenes in Sudan, very close to the places where the fighting actually took place. In fact, when documenting myself to write this review, I even read that the director took the opportunity to meet people who lived through the events, who participated in the combats and even gave military period training to the extras, where we can find also some real soldiers of the British Army. Sets, costumes, props and weaponry were details thought out in detail to recreate faithfully what would have been possible to find if we were there. Of course, there are flaws, but they are irrelevant. Before finishing, a word of praise for the soundtrack, signed by Miklos Rosza.",10.0

Once again, the Korda's present us with an ensemble of strong performances and a wonderfully colourful and well-paced adventure story of determination and betrayal that is tinged with quite a bit of sadness, too.

22 years after the murderous and maniacal events at Bates Motel, Norman Bates, freshly released from a mental institution, is back home; and the spectre of ”Mother” is waiting to greet him.

We could say it was a cynical attempt at latching onto the coat tails of the 1980s slasher boom, but in spite of having the unenviable task of being a sequel to a masterpiece, Psycho II is a rather nifty sequel.

Director Richard Franklin is helped by having Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles heading up the cast list, this gives the film instant credibility, and while the mighty spectre of Hitchcock looms large, Franklin doesn’t copy the maestro and brings his own visual smarts to the piece.

Tom Holland’s screenplay doesn’t mimic either, expanding the Bates story with a series of quality twists whilst keeping the mystery element strong and the gripping factor on the high heat. Dean Cundey (cinematography) and Jerry Goldsmith (music) round out the strong points of the film’s tech credits.

Norman goes back to his deceased mother’s house & motel where he befriends a compassionate local waitress (Meg Tilly). Unfortunately, some unforgiving locals won’t let him live in peace.

The first half of “Psycho II” (1983) is a compelling continuation of the classic 1960 film whereupon there’s an unexpected plot development around the mid-point (which is great, by the way).

From there, the events tend to bog down inside the creepy house with somewhat contrived twists & turns as the creators try to keep you confused as to who’s killing who. Thankfully, everything is sort of explained at the end with another revelation and what happened makes sense if you think about it. I say “sort of” because the truth isn’t fully spelled out. I appreciate that the film respects the intelligence of the viewer, but they should’ve made it a little clearer IMHO.

In any case, “Psycho II” includes several elements of the original while expanding on the story.

What’s great about the Psycho franchise is that it has its own story and Norman is a sympathetic character. It’s really a tragedy and not like the typical slasher where the antagonist is a zombie-like killing machine and its victims are mostly partying teenagers.

10586,"Oh, you're right. The devil has come to Tsavo. Look at me, I am the devil.

The Ghost and the Darkness is directed by Stephen Hopkins and written by William Goldman. It stars Val Kilmer, Michael Douglas, Tom Wilkinson, John Kani, Bernard Hill, Brian McCardie and Emily Mortimer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond.

Tsavo, Kenya and a bridge engineer teams up with an experienced professional hunter to hunt for two lions that have been attacking local construction workers.

As is often the case, one should seek out the real stories that are involved in this retelling of the real instances involving the Tsavo Lions

The story itself is awash with mysticism, the lions (Ghost and Darkness) act as some sort of supernatural beings, who we are told are offing the native folk purely for pleasure. There's an odd juxtaposition with this, in that in the midst of colonialism and macho posturing, the hunters of felines are forgivable because they are defenders of mankind - even though we know that man hunts the great feline beasts for fun regardless of this particular situation.

Various stereotypes fil out the screenplay, though not as to be insulting, but you feel that the pic as first envisaged would have had more to say on political frontage and period turmoil. It basically all ends up as a creature feature, two great white hunters facing town the monstrous enemy as their very lives become perilous by the hour.

The attack sequences are nicely staged, wonderfully primal in fact, ensuring that what the pic lacks in intelligent narrative worth it makes up for with thrills and genuine nervy suspense. So with Zsigmond providing some lovely African postcard lensing, and Goldsmith adding music that powerfully bounces around the locales, the tech credits are ensuring our eyes and ears are suitably stoked.

One key character's story arc is stupidly given short shrift, annoyingly so and coming off like someone ran out of time to either write or perform something else, and the uneven feel to it all tends to gnaw away at the enjoyment factor. Yet in spite of the flaws and unfulfilled promise there's a nice old fashioned feel to it, something that seems to have engaged the movie loving public more than it does the pro critics. Interesting that. 6.5/10",7.0
10586,"I loved this movie when I got to see it when it was first released.  
Based on a true story (in fact the only part that was made up for is the lions' den scene), this movie breathes Africa due to the incredible cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond.  Africa is as bright and as amazing in this film as it is in person.  There is no CGI, only real, trained lions and real effects.   
Set during the European colonialisation of Africa, we focus on the British need to complete a railway bridge across a small river which is complicated by 2 lions who seem to hunt for fun, not just food.  

Even now, 25 years after it was made I still love this movie.   And even knowing its plot by heart, I still clench a little and hold my breath a bit - the tension during the climatic scenes is that good.  
All of the leads give good performances, but Michael Douglas is the stand out with his grizzled big-game hunter persona mixed with the ""action-man"" persona that he honed in his 1980s films like Romancing the Stone. 
The only part that falls short is the underwhelming score by Goldsmith which just reeks of missed opportunities - there is no real leitmotifs or even hints of adventure or Africa.  
But that aside, this is a great movie looking into an incredible story in one of lesser known parts of the massive African continent. 

This is a movie who's story stays with you, much like Africa itself does.   
I love this movie.",9.0
10586,"**Overall, a good African adventure film.**

Overall, I liked this film. Africa has always held a fascination for Europeans, and anyone who has lived there will certainly recognize that it leaves a mark, a kind of spell or enchantment. Anyone who is there for a while never forgets Africa, and always brings with them a little bit of this magnificent and martyred continent. The film manages to give a flavor of the wild enchantment of Africa, especially the natural beauty that hides in its most untouched regions.

And that leads us to talk about the production and visuals of this film, which are simply beautiful and transport us very easily to the time portrayed. I'm not an expert, but I didn't notice any glaring errors, apart from some props that seemed too modern for the year 1896. Being a film that takes place during the British colonization of the African interior, it is naturally told from the European perspective, with the construction of a railway line being described as an authentic feat of engineering and courage of the English colonizers, determined to unite the continent from Cairo to the Cape despite the ambitions and demands of other governments, such as Belgium or even Portugal, who opposed the project. The cinematography is beautiful, the images use warm colors and the landscapes chosen as the location for filming couldn't be more beautiful. The sets, costumes and effects used in the film meet all the requirements and give us an additional touch of style and elegance.

As for the cast, we have some positive points and some downright negative points to take into account. On the one hand, Val Kilmer doesn't seem to have the necessary strength for the character he was given. He would have been much more effective in a role that didn't require so much action and physical effort. Still, he seems sufficiently credible to me as an engineer who goes to Africa for work and finds himself in a situation for which he was not at all prepared and in which he will have to fight to stay alive. The actor, it must be said, really seems to be in a pitiful state all the time, and I suspect that the weather was one of the reasons that led to so much obvious wear and tear. Tom Wilkinson, Henry Cele and John Kani are worthy additions who raise the overall quality of the cast and prevent this from being a one-man film. Unfortunately, I hated seeing Michael Douglas here. In addition to his character being an authentic egoic self-praise, it was invented just to satisfy this actor's desire to appear where he had no space or place.

Being an adventure film where we deal with animals that eat people, it would be a little predictable to have high doses of gore and broken bodies. However, the film is quite calm and does not show us scenes that are really bloody. The script is something that we need to develop a little. The story of this film is solidly based on an incident that took place in Tsavo, Kenya, in which a pair of local lions (not at all like the ones used in the film, as the Tsavo lion does not have a mane) began massacring the bridge workers who were carrying them. British were building, causing dozens of deaths. However, it is not a faithful portrayal of events. Of course, there is a certain amount of space to create, and I would place all the wild and crazy action scenes within this level of creativity inherent to any film. What I cannot accept is the subversion of the facts that happens when the character of the beast hunter played by Douglas is introduced. This character did not exist, the two lions were killed without help by John Henry Patterson, or at least he claimed so.",7.0
10587,"**An honorable sequence where the script sounds better, although some comic material seems a little worn out.**

This is the fourth film in the prolific “Police Academy” franchise, which visibly marked the 80s and 90s, and which still brings good memories to many people today. I can say that it was one of the comic franchises that I enjoyed during my childhood and adolescence, and that I still see it from time to time.

In this fourth film, I felt that the production learned from the flaws of the previous films, especially when it comes to script writing. If the older films had in their weak scripts the biggest problem to overcome, this film responds with a more careful writing and the creation of a more logical story, capable of sustaining all sorts of jokes and comic situations created later. As a result, the film feels more like a cohesive work of cinema. However, it is undeniable that the comic material presented begins to show wear and tear and is not enough to make us laugh, even if it manages to do it several times.

For the last time, the film brings together all the main names of the cast and crew from the previous films, and the replacement of Jerry Parris by Jim Drake in the director's chair is barely perceptible: the new director has really managed to capture the spirit of the franchise and give it an honorable following. Steve Guttenberg says goodbye to his character, Mahoney, who will live for the last time, walking out the big door with a job well done. Michael Winslow and Bob Goldthwait were also in excellent shape and seem to have a lot of fun with their characters, along with the excellent Tim Kazurinsky. Sharon Stone was a surprising addition, but it works well thanks to the actress' physical beauty.

Technically, the film is very much on par with its predecessors, and the final aerial sequence really deserves a round of applause for the execution and the way it was done. Good sets, the costumes we already know, the soundtrack without major demerits or surprises and a decent cinematography make up the scenario of a film that, if it is not capable of enchanting, manages to convince most fans of the franchise.",6.0
10588,"Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend, but more for older audiences.

While ""The Cat in the Hat"" is a famous children's book, this is clearly just aimed at the folks that might have read it when they were children.  That mixes the nostalgia factor with the slew of adult oriented jokes (like infomercials) and the unnecessary addition of mother being single and dating.  Kids aren't going to find humor in those situations.

The material that is closer to the original book is much more charming and I imagine that kids will relate to it more as the kids are much more involved, or even the focus of the scenes.

The Cat in the Hat, even though he is the title character, is a support character to the two kids, played by Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin, who both do all they can with the writing to balance out Mike Myers as the Cat.  I don't feel like Mike Myers understands the idea of being a supporting character: he gives me a very Tom Cruise / Jimmy Fallon vibe where if there was a pause, then would just center himself in the camera and do something to draw attention.  ""Oh yeah!"" is a good example for this movie, a repeated, unnecessary line that doesn't once help the scene let alone the movie.

One would think after Jim Carey's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""  (2000) there would be a formula for how to adapt Dr. Seuss books (20 pages) to full length feature films, and someone clearly figured it out later in ""The Lorax"" (2012) and ""The Grinch"" (2018), so I'm....gonna blame Mike Myers.

Him aside, the movie has a lot of charm to it, and Alec Baldwin manages to work an unnecessary part to at least be a believable antagonist, though the best acting in the world can't make a bad part good.

Brosnan and Harrelson's chemistry as frenemies is fun and entertaining, while Hayek's Lola is a cool, strong, skilled partner that tries to ground Brosnan's insatiable desire for the next big heist. After the Sunset is a fun and excellent exploration of what happens to the thief that gets away.",7.0
10590,"Mel Gibson (""Col. Moore"") takes charge of training for, and then execution of, a perilous operation in the Vietnamese highlands in 1965. We know from the start of the film how difficult that task is going to be - the previous French troops met with ruthless treatment at the hands of the N.V.A. and so ""Moore"" and his motivational deputy ""Crandall"" (Greg Kinnear) know that they are going to have their work cut out for them. Their mission is to combat an enemy with overwhelming superiority of numbers and try to capture and hold a mountain. Needless to say, their hosts are none too keen on that a plan and what ensues is a brutally depicted, bloody and gory, series of well photographed combat scenes that test the mettle of both sides as the body count mounts. There is a poignant angle added too, as back home we see the colonel's wife ""Julie"" (Madeleine Stowe) take responsibility for delivery of the letters that are sent to the families on the base intimating bad - even tragic - news to those left behind. Sam Elliott adds well some stoic discipline as ""Sgt. Maj. Plumley"" and Chris Klein's portrayal of the recent father ""Lt. Geoghegan"" also contributes a strong human angle to this story. Sadly, though, this is all way too long and though certainly potent at the start, that is washed away in a sea of repetition. What makes us sit up and take notice at the start becomes much less effective; the pyrotechnics lose their impressiveness a bit and to be honest, Gibson just hasn't the on-screen presence to carry this for 2¼ hours. It does emphasise just how modern - airborne, usually - warfare can provide smaller groups with greater superiority and as an example of the ghastliness and futility of war it is a worth watching.",6.0
10592,"Like Hogan's Heroes but serious and quasi-realistic

RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Gregory Hoblit, ""Hart's War"" is a war flick about a paper-pushing lieutenant with a background in law (Colin Farrell) who is unexpectedly captured in Belgium and taken to a POW camp in southern Germany in the closing months of the European theater of the war. He eventually befriends and defends a Tuskegee Airmen (Terrence Howard). Marcel Iures plays the humane German commandant while Bruce Willis plays the tough-as-nails American colonel of the POWs. Cole Hauser is on hand as a racist soldier. 

This is obviously not a conventional WWII flick. Although it starts out with some great war action, it has more in common with films like ""Stalag 17"" (1953) and ""The Great Escape"" (1963), albeit with modern filmmaking craft. As my title blurb points out, it's reminiscent of Hogan's Heroes but without the comedy, plus elements of “A Few Good Men” (1992). The film isn't really about survival in the POW camp, but rather the tensions of the prisoners and the criminal drama.

Some have complained that no fascist camp colonel in his right mind would allow such a trial as depicted in the movie. But there are several reasons why the commandant would allow it: (1.) for entertainment, (2.) to witness and understand the American way, (3.) he knew the war would be over soon and wanted to have the Allie's favor, or (4.) a mixture of the above. Keep in mind that the commandant went to school in the US after the first world war so he was enamored by American lifestyle and had a fondness for jazz. I'm sure entertainment was a huge factor since POW camp life is just as boring for the captors as it is for the captives over time.

The climax telegraphs that this is a war MOVIE and not real life, but it's packed with action and gripping drama. It’s also ultimately quite moving. Although it failed at the box office, ""Hart's War"" is a very good WWII POW camp movie and, in some ways, great.

10596,"Double Trouble for Van Damme again!

Yet another Jean-Claude Van Damme film that sees him tasked with playing two characters. In spite of its shaky reputation this isn’t half bad, it delivers what most Van Damme fans expect, namely bonkers fights and shifty science. Plot has Van Damme as a fire obsessed serial killer who is always one step ahead of the police. Enter science as a chance to clone the killer arises and this sets in motion the wheels of the Van Damme clone trying to come to terms with his alien world as he, and world weary police officer Jake Riley (Michael Rooker), set about capturing the unhinged mad man.

It’s of course daft but it’s a whole bunch of fun, and with the strong presence of Rooker supplemented by two very interesting performances by Van Damme, pic is in good hands. The fight scenes are smoothly choreographed and exciting, with director Ringo Lam clearly aware of what makes a Van Damme movie work. It’s not prime Van Damme, but it’s above average and well worth checking out for those so inclined. 6/10",6.0
10596,"Jean-Claude Van Damme does the Italian neorealists one better; not only was he born to play himself, but also his twin — here, however, he mixes it up a bit, playing his clone instead. 

JCVD ​​is Edward 'The Torch' Garrotte, a serial killer who likes to burn the corpses of the women he murders (why they gave him that last name but don’t have him use an actual garrotte, I haven’t the foggiest), whom Detective Jake Riley (Michael Rooker) has unsuccessfully pursued for the past three years — up to and including his last day on the force before retiring to apparently take up boat repairing.

It turns out to be a 10 Minute Retirement; a secret government agency has cloned Garrotte from DNA found at a crime scene, and needs Jake's help to babysit the clone while he tracks down the killer — except they don’t call it a clone, but a ""replicant"". The difference between one and the other is never satisfactorily explained, but as far as I can tell, it takes at least a week for a replicant to be up and about (""God created man in six days, we took longer;"" actually, God created man on the sixth day, not in six days. No wonder it took your ignorant asses longer).

Additionally, while a clone has to grow and mature, a replicant comes out fully formed (complete, if my eyes don’t deceive me, with a navel), just like Pallas Athena from Zeus’ forehead — but then this is business as usual for clones in the movies, so I don't understand why this one feels the need to make a point out of its not being a clone.

Unless, of course, director Ringo Lam deliberately wants us to think of Blade Runner (it's never a good idea to remind the audience that they could be watching a much better film; only instead of seeing ""attack ships blazing from Orion's shoulder"" and ""C-beams glowing in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate,” JCVD ​​eats dog food and falls in love with a whore.

What’s certain is that the Replicant has the same muscular build as Garrotte; now, since a physique like JCVD's usually requires spending a lot in a gym — and time and a gym are two things that the Replicant lacks — I have no choice but to assume that Garrotte was born, like the baby in Meet the Spartans, with built-in muscles, a characteristic that his clone inherited (along with the uncontrollable desire to do splits).

How do its creators intend for the Replicant to find Garrotte? “Well, we've augmented his telepathic ability by re-sequencing his genetic code from the genome. It may be our first, but genetic memory has been scientifically proven"" — as has, I guess, telepathy, which is not the same thing; genetic memory would allow an individual to 'remember' something that they never learned (music, math), but the Replicator can recall specific actions performed by Garrotte. 
Anyway, the idea is for the Replicant to experience some sort of Proustian Madeleine moment, and it's Jake's job — who presumably knows Garotte as well as Steve Carell knows Proust in Little Miss Sunshine — to jog his memory. 

The rest is a disastrous hybrid of 48 Hrs. and Rain Man — the Replicant is basically a kid trapped in the body of a Belgian karate fighter (although come to think of it, so is the real JCVD) — that is neither good science fiction (the science, such as it is, being rather nebulous) nor good chopsocky (a character fighting himself invariably results in awkwardly choreographed action sequences). Then again, this movie was doomed they cast Michael 'Henry Lee Lucas' Rooker as the detective as opposed to the serial killer.",1.0

Captured by the wild man, it doesn’t take long for the heiress from San Francisco (Leslie Mann) to see that George is a better man than her arrogant, condescending fiancé (Thomas Hayden Church). 

“George of the Jungle” (1997) is an over-the-top spoof of Tarzan inspired by the 60’s cartoon which I’ve never seen. You have to be able to appreciate fun, goofy humor to enjoy this quirky family comedy/adventure. It helps that Fraser is both likable and amusing in the eponymous role (I should add that he really inspires guys to improve their fitness). Meanwhile Mann is as sweet & beautiful as Bernadette Peters in her prime. Everything clicks for great entertainment; I laughed through practically the whole flick.

10612,"I don't want Ffynnon Garw to be on the map because we begged for it. 

The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain is directed by Christopher Monger and written by Ivor Monger. It stars Hugh Grant, Ian McNeice, Tara Fitzgerald, Colm Meaney and Kenneth Griffith. Music is by Stephen Endelman and cinematography by Vernon Layton.

Set in 1917, plot finds Grant and McNeice as two English cartographers who arrive in the Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw to measure what the locals proudly proclaim to be Wales' first mountain. However, it turns out that the ""mountain"" is 16 feet below the required 1000 feet requisite so therefore can only be classed as a hill. This news causes disgust amongst the locals, who then set about stopping the cartographers going home whilst they attempt to build atop of the hill to make it over 1000 feet.

A film with a big title that is matched by the size of its heart, Monger's film owes much to those fun community based pictures that filed out of Ealing Studios back in the 40s and 50s, Re: Whisky Galore! and The Titfield Thunderbolt. We can also safely place it the whimsy category where something as wonderful as Local Hero sits, while the old British comedy staple that encompasses an obsession with size (The Mouse That Roared) watches over the film like an approving British cinematic angel.

Homespun humour marries up with the utterly engaging view of quirky village life to provide us with just under 100 minutes of entertainment. Although clearly simple in plot and structure, to simply dismiss it as such does not do justice to the fine work of the ensemble cast and the writing of Ivor and Chris Monger. With Grant doing what he does best, the amiable nervous fop, picture has a lead actor fully comfortable with the tone and texture of the production, while around him there are a number of fine character actors putting delightful meat on the comedy bones of oddball characters with names such as Morgan the Goat, Johny Shellshock, William the Petroleum and Betty from Cardiff! Best of the bunch is Griffith as Reverend Jones, a grumpy, stubborn eccentric who underpins everything so wonderfully skew-whiff about life in Ffynnon Garw.

As for the writing? The screenplay has a wonderful ear for small village dialogue, while in amongst the value of community spirit theme, sits a near sombre observation of the effects of war on such a community. The production design is appealing, with Layton's photography around the Powys locations a visual treat, and Endelman's music has a suitably warming and jaunty feel; even if it starts to get a touch repetitive later in the piece. It doesn't have widespread appeal, it's clearly a film aimed at a small portion of film fans that love those films mentioned earlier. But in an era when film is being smothered by CGI and visual gimmickry, revisiting something like The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain offers up a most refreshing and diverting experience. 8/10",8.0
10623,"High on action, low on grey matter.

I guess when push comes to shove it’s an action film that delivers the requisite supply of biff, bam and kerpow action sequences. Yet even allowing for the old “leave the brain at the door” requirement for such action comic malarkey, the script is too poor, the acting equally so, while the choreography is weak. The latter of which a big misstep when you have Jet Li and Mark Dacascos fronting the good guy/bad guy axis of the story.

Plot pitches Li’s ass kicking detective with DMX’s urban thief together as an unlikely buddy buddy combo trailing missing diamonds and DMX’s kidnapped daughter, and that’s pretty much it. There’s no attempts to expand the characters or add some emotional depth to what is meant to be a pretty critical situation.

It often feels tired, like a recycling of so many other film’s of similar ilk, originality is out the window here, hell they even get Tom Arnold in to reprise a watered down version of his character from True Lies. Gabrielle Union and Kelly Hu are on hand to add the sexy sizzle in thankless roles, while Dacascos barely registers as an uber villain.

Fifty-five years on, it's hard to appreciate just how profound this kind cinema was in alerting the US population to the bigotries in their own backyard, and Poitier always was a poised and measured actor when it came to making a point without shoving it down your throat!

Based on real events in 1971, where T.C. Williams High School, a now hot bed integrated school, becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.

As is normally the case with films of this ilk, it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. In reality the issues of race, integration and the near powder-keg atmosphere portrayed in the picture, were long past their worst in Virginia 1971. However, that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this Disney production. As is told in the film, the Titans did have what became known as the perfect season, whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. All told, the film soars high as an inspirational piece, not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being, but in the crucial tale of one Gerry Bertier.

That this film urged me to seek out the story of Bertier is a testament to the power of film, regardless of any sort of sentimental prodding from the film makers. It's hoped that this film also prompts newcomers to research further the topics within the story.

The cast list is impressive, Denzel Washington and Will Patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences, with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Ethan Suplee, Donald Faison, Kip Pardue, Craig Kirkwood and a pre-fame Ryan Gosling fill out the integrated football team. While two important female family roles are nicely portrayed by Hayden Panettiere and Nicole Ari Parker. The soundtrack is nicely put together, with the core offering of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's thumping rendition of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" particularly potent and uplifting. 

Though not primarily offering up anything new in the pantheon of race and sport related movies, Remember The Titans does have so much good going for it. It's hard to be picky, even churlish about the little faults (are these actors really the age of high schoolers for example?), so hopefully come the end, after the credits roll, you will be suitably inspired and perhaps a touch more better off for having spent time with this particular football team. 8.5/10",8.5
10637,"OK, well, reading through the bad reviews there are some grudges here based on, well, how the other teams were depicted because 1971 wasn't long enough for some of the people that played them to pass on their mortal coils.

I can relate to that. I grew up countryfied and have tasted the salt of playing against a school that was three or four times our size, schools that could afford to cherry-pick who played. Schools where the defense could rest when the offense was on the field...apparently T.C. Williams was one of those giant schools.

I can sympathize with some of the negative reviews here...because, honestly, if they made a movie like this about Woodstock, I'd give it 1 star out of principal. Seriously, no, we might be hicks, but we rotate from linebacker to offensive tackle. When you faced off against schools that had an actual student body, you knew you were going to lose, the only question was how hard were you going to make their victory. Sounds like T.C. Williams was one of those giant schools.

OK, rant done.

I caught this on TNT and the music drew me in right away. Hear a good song it catches your ear and drags you in.

And this has the acting to back it up. It's very... nice seeing Washington NOT playing the smart-cop role or a variation there of. He can act, he can act well, and this is one of the movies where he's not playing the same role over and over again. So, when he comes out of that shell and gets a gig playing a role he doesn't always play... it's kind of a treat isn't it?

Of course the highlight was really Hayden Panettiere, not because she was absolutely adorable in the film (which she was), but more because she did a great job of turning a little girl into that parent, on the sidelines, that thinks he's Ditka, so she was not only adorable but hysterical.

The Hippie, Ryan Gosling?, was another little gem, not because he did a particularly good job acting, though it was fair enough. No, he stood out because anyone that's payed football knew someone like him. It gave it a bit of an authentic feel.

The only real downside was that, by 1971, schools were integrated and been for a while. It kind of lost that authenticity when they went that route. But, you know what, who cares, it was entertaining enough despite that.

It was a solid football movie.

And for all the 1 star reviews, particularly those written by people from the smaller schools that had to go up against the Titans... I feel for you.

“Autumn in New York” (2000) is a romance that mixes “Love Story” (1970) with a little “Pretty Woman” (1990). It has a lot of good in it, especially the Fall cinematography of the better parts of the Big Apple, as well as the characters played by Elaine Stritch and JK Simmons, not to mention Vera Farmiga. The ""human lie detector"" scene is great too. 

Unfortunately, there’s zero build-up to consummation and Gere’s character is depicted in an outrageously negative light despite his good-looking charisma. I’m talking the first 40 minutes of the movie. Why would anyone with a brain want to waste their precious time on such a person?

I suppose you could view it as a character study and the power of love to change an attractive-but-loathsome person but, if that’s the case, explain what contemptibly happens at the Halloween party. Still, it's a bold scene that captures the viewer unaware and should be respected for that. No one can say it's an imitation of ""Love Story"" from 30 years earlier. Also, the close with Vera’s character is notable in a heartwarming way. There’s hope for ANYONE, if they’re humble and penitent.

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan.

10644,"**The Unbearable lightness of Sex.**

When the recently deceased Milan Kundera published “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” he probably knew that the book would be both loved and hated. Based on the philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, it outlines a story full of eroticism between four characters amid the turmoil resulting from the Prague Spring in 1968, and the “years of lead” that followed. What this film did was adapt the novel to the cinema, with some changes and focusing attention on the two central characters.

I read the book many years ago and didn't like it. In the book, the author exposes philosophical positions taken from Nietzsche's ideas and where he privileges sex and the search for pleasure while relativizing and diminishing love. No idea could be more different from my thinking. After all, what could be more fleeting than an orgasm? In a subtle way, the book ends up proving me right: the characters live very troubled lives until the moment they find the serenity that stable feelings, such as love and friendship, can bring to each person's life. From this short review, you can already tell that I didn't like the film. I still decided to watch it due to the amount of positive opinions I heard and the presence of some big names in cinema.

Directed by Philip Kaufman, the film was made almost immediately after the book was published, but the adaptation is quite weak. The film essentially focuses on one thing: sex. I shouldn't be exaggerating if I say that we can't watch thirty minutes of film without see a naked woman or a couple in the act, and the film is almost three hours long. It was something that had to be part of the film, given the content of the book, but I think there was an exaggeration on the part of the producers and screenwriters. Nudity is very present, bluntly, from all angles, which makes the film heavier. With so much attention to sordid details, the rich characterization of Kundera's characters got lost somewhere: Tereza couldn't seem more confused and Tomás was transformed into a debauched maniac who can't see a woman in front of him and can't respect his wife.

What about the book's political plot, in which Kundera exposes his aversion to his country's regime? The film tells us very little. The images of the Prague Spring are striking, in large part due to the superb cinematography and the way they combined archival footage with the film, and we have the feeling, from then on, that the authorities' control is suffocating, but no much more is told or revealed to us. Again, the attention is focused on nudity and sex, not on what matters in the book.

On a positive note, we must highlight the performance of the cast, led by Daniel Day-Lewis and Juliette Binoche. Day-Lewis is undeniably a great actor and has immense talent, and the only thing that stops us from appreciating his performance more is the disgust for his character. Binoche, I confess, has already seemed much more interesting to me in other characters and works, but she also has enough space to shine. They also have the support of Lena Olin, Derek de Lint, and we can also count on the special participation of Stellan Skarsgård. On a technical level, in addition to the exquisite cinematography that I have already mentioned, we also have the excellent recreation of the period, palpable in all the props, sets and costumes and an excellent soundtrack.",4.0

If you are just running out dirt humor comedies, then this might do the trick, but it's definitely lower quality than, say, ""American Pie"".

With some low-tier male actors, and underrating their female stars, this doesn't have the writing or star power to really wow me.

Shannon Elizabeth owns every scene she is in, by far the best actor in this, and probably the funniest too.  Jamie Lee Pressly is basically reduced to a male fantasy gag.  I actually like Jake Busey (""The Frighteners"", I'm unsure exactly why), but his character is specifically unlikeable in this, and barely funny with a one-note joke of being a misogynistic asshole.

After watching this film I just remembered the quote from 'Sullivan's Travels' which says 'film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known'. Indeed, cinema's for entertainment as well acts as a message deliverer. This was an inspirational movie, and everybody must see it. I know I'm a bit late to see it, better late than never, right? I'm really glad for having it at the right time because 15 years ago I did not have this blog to write about it.

OK, the name of the movie represents the theme of the story. No matter its a developed or developing country, society needs something like the idea this movie talks about. Carrying a good social message, the movie slightly lags behind the too much on the emotions, especially the end part. There won't be a problem if you like melodrama. Other than that, I feel the conclusion was smart and strong, a better solution which would appeal for certain group rather alternate finale.

The film was based on the novel of the same name, crafted by a fine director with the wonderful cast. Haley Joel Osment had a great career as a child-star, you should check some of his films if you love children's movies including this title on the top of that list. As a middle aged actor, Helen Hunt's one of the last best performances before turning into a senior artist. It's not a usual role for Kevin Spacey, but he nailed it with the good dialogues. Especially his talk about the topic 'child abuse' was a great thing from the movie. Overall, the actors get more credit for the first- class acts as the script demanded for their respective roles.

> What did you ever do to change the world. 

A movie about a man who achieved in science gets the Oscar, not that real man. A movie about a man escapes from the war prison camp and slavery gets the award, and again none of those real persons. But a movie with the original, intelligent, inspiring, specially designed for a movie was not even a contender of the Oscars. Of course, it was transformed from a book, though there are/were no real people behind these great characters, all are imagined/created for the book and the movie. I never understood the American Academy Awards.

By now you would know that I hate critics badly if you are a regular reader of my blog. Once again they failed to recognise how great the morality of the story is, rather they have concentrated to criticise the writing and the technical aspect of the film. Although, it was not a box office flop or earned beyond, but got a lot of praise from the families. It's a wonderful family drama, but still too far from being a masterpiece. Intelligent enough one to get motivated towards the social issues. Being practical in the real world is a concern as it is risky, depending on the situation and the person, just like this movie's ending. Rare to find a movie like this, you must check it out.

Magnum Force is directed by Ted Post and collectively written by Harry and Rita Fink, John Milius and Michael Cimino. It stars Clint Eastwood, Hal Holbrook, Mitchell Ryan, David Soul, Felton Perry, Tim Matheson and Robert Urich. Music is by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by  Frank Stanley.
 
The second Dirty Harry movie finds Inspector Callahan on the trail of a vigilante group who are offing Frisco’s villains.
 
Following in the wake of ""Dirty Harry"" was never going to be easy, Don Siegel’s film was very much a trail blazer of sorts, giving the movie lovers of the world a different cop than that which was accustomed. So what to do with ""Magnum Force"" then, the inevitable sequel given ""Dirty Harry’s"" popularity? The makers come up with a great idea, have Harry confront a group of vigilantes who believe in his own kill crime ethics, only they take it to the extreme.
 
So begins a trail of blood for Harry to follow which leads him right where we the viewers pretty much knew he was going to end up. Ted Post is no Don Siegel, and although the action and all round testosterone feel that so marked out the ""Dirty Harry"" films is exciting and evident respectively, there’s periods where the film meanders. The instances that serve to add more complexity to Harry’s make-up is welcome, but aside from a jumping bean turn from Holbrook, the director can’t get much out of the rest of the cast, as shame since there’s a lot of up and coming talent and stalwarts in the mix.
 
Still, even with some minor and evident problems it’s a lively and entertaining sequel (the best of them actually), one that doesn’t shy away from pushing some buttons and baiting of critics who had disdain for the first film. The ending is a disappointment, though, but the journey is ultimately meaty and macho. 7.5/10",7.0

The Enforcer is directed by James Fargo and collectively written by Harry Julian Fink, Rita M. Fink, Stirling Silliphant, Dean Riesner, Gail Morgan Hickman and S.W. Schurr. It stars Clint Eastwood, Tyne Daly, Harry Guardino, Bradford Dillman,  DeVeren Bookwalter and John Mitchum. Music is by Jerry Fielding and cinematography by Charles W. Short.

Dirty Harry Callahan is tasked with foiling a terrorist organization made up of supposed revolutionaries. However, when he's partnered by a rookie female cop he's far from best pleased and feels sure she's out of her depth.

This is the third entry of what would eventually become five Clint Eastwood starring Dirty Harry films. Sensing the need to inject a bit of freshness to what was obviously going to be a safe ""no nonsense cop"" formula, the makers introduce a nifty complexity to Callahan's world by pairing him up with a female cop - one that's fresh out of school. So with Callahan's propensity for being irked about partners in general, and his suspected misogyny dangled by his superiors, this is a forward thinking turn of events by the writers.

From a narrative stand point director Fargo (for his feature film debut) doesn't deviate from what made the previous two films a success. Pacing is steady so that this allows dramatic character interplays to breathe, and forceful action sequences bounce into the fray at various junctures. This is not however detrimental to the story, which zips along and is punctured by customary Dirty Harry humour. The relationship between Harry and Kate (passable but not quite a great casting choice) builds through various stages, from begrudging mentor and pupil beginnings, to something that actually ends up rather touching.

Sadly this ""Dirty Harry"" film lacks great villainy, the People's Revolutionary Strike Force come off as a mixed bunch of psychos and confused hippies, with not enough screen time for their leader (Bookwalter) to impact greatly on proceedings. Be that as it may, there's enough for Callahan to chew on, with the gruff straight talking cop surrounded by the usual moronic bureaucrats and handy allies (the always great Albert Popwell in a customary appearance). Where it stands with fans of the Dirty Harry series as a whole is unclear? for The Enforcer appears to now be fondly remembered more the decades have passed.

Unfairly forgotten and left in the slipstream of critical darlings Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill can proudly fly its own worthwhile flag. There's nothing preachy or political here, director John Irvin and writer James Carabatsos approach the subject with a refreshing humane honesty, making us viewers privy to the American soldiers mindset as they cope with life in Vietnam before an assault on some turd pile strategic hill, a battle that the survivors of that particular bloody conflict would call Hamburger Hill.

No matter what one feels about the war, the politics of such etc, the fact that quite often Vietnam films zoom in on the misdemeanours and egotistical sides of the American presence in Vietnam, tends to detract from the bravery of men and boys who were doing the job their government decreed they should do. Hamburger Hill addresses this, proudly so. Pace is deliberate and literate, building up to the assault on Hill 937, with little slices of kinetic action inserted along the way to tantalise and torment in equal measure.

Not all the acting is smart, there's a cast of up and coming thesps on show that features some who have gone on to be ""name"" actors, while others that were out of their depth subsequently found a level more befitting their abilities. Yet this is also a cunning tactic in the film's favour, no stars needed here, young adult actors without baggage or headlines kind of feels appropriate for this portrayal of soldiers in an alien world, many of whom would lay their shattered bodies down in the mud at Hamburger Hill. 8/10",9.0

But otherwise this is the forgotten cousin of Platoon. It's not exactly as good as Platoon, but it is more solid start-to-finish than Full Metal Jacket was.

The strength really comes from an attempt to depict the events without really making anything heroic, or action-hero dramatic. And, instead, they do their best to make it just a straight war movie. No great odyssey, no moral point, no real views on Vietnam as opposed to other wars. Just a straight war movie and nothing.

It's not unlike Saving Private Ryan, in which the film is able to make both a pro-soldier statement while also being anti-war. It's a fine line to walk, but they do it with the skill needed to both show absolute brutality, and the humanity of soldiers that are put in that horrible situation.",10.0

They only have a few days, but in those days their relationships develop, thrive, vacillate and ultimately Milos Forman presents us with a quite subtly scathing commentary on a mid-1960s USA. I still think this works better on the stage - the confined space there forces the characters and scenarios together better, but this is still a strong big-screen adaptation that allows the music and dance numbers to retain much of their punch. The characterisations run deep too with plenty of their gang having slightly more than bit parts to complement the thrust of the burgeoning romance. It's perhaps that that lets this down a little. The pair are rarely seen together and the portrayal of their ""love"" is a wee bit on the shallow side. Musically, there are more than a few familiar numbers to keep the pace rollicking along, and perhaps the fairly explicit nature of some of the lyrics explains why this did rather better on the European Awards circuit than it did in the USA (or the UK).

10655,"I first watched this movie in a movie theater shortly after it came out. It only had a limited release, so most people saw it as a cable release movie.  From the opening title crawl and showing the lead actors in their roles juxtaposed with pictures of the actual historical figures, it had me hook.

It is based on the novel The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara. It is one of the first books on the Civil War I read, based on a recommendation by a coworker. I have read dozens and dozens of books on the topic since then, and it is still one of my favorites. Considering that it is a fairly short book, the fact that the movie is over four hours long tells you that a lot more research was done.

I can’t speak to how the actors did with the various southern accents, but I thought it was a strong cast, right down to the lesser roles. I have heard they utilized Civil War re-enactors in the filming, a good source of extras who were familiar with the time period and brought their own period clothing!

Of course it didn’t hurt my feelings that one of the leads: Jeff Daniels, plays Joshua Chamberlain, who hails from my home state of Maine and who lived a remarkable life: college professor, Volunteer army lieutenant who rose to become a general and Medal of Honor recipient, Governor of Maine - and more. Apparently, thanks to this movie, the most popular spot for tourists at the Gettysburg National Battlefield is where the 20th Maine and Chamberlain fought. As a side note, another offshoot of the story behind Chamberlain and the 20th Maine’s exploits is the song Dixieland by Steve Earle. Whenever I hear the song I want to watch the movie, and vice versa.

Anyway, of course it is a war movie, and I do not normally like war flicks, but this one is much more than that. You can pretend it is a mini-series and watch it in two or three sittings if that makes it easier. Some people say it lets the southerners off the hook politically, but there is a speech about race relations by Chamberlain that addresses the race issue, I believe, and provides balance.

""Gettysburg"" (1993) has a lot going for it: an all-star cast, including Tom Berenger (Longstreat), Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain) and Sam Elliott (Buford); great authentic Gettysburg locations; good battle scenes; a commitment to historical accuracy; and thousands upon thousands of Civil War reenactors.

Part I is highlighted by Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top and his bold bayonet charge while Part II ends with the South's infamous Pickett's Charge. Both of these sequences are great and they give the viewer a good feel of what it must have really been like, which is one of the reasons I enjoy seeing historical films. Since both halves run the length of a normal movie, I strongly suggest splitting your viewing experiencing into two segments; it’s just too much to digest in one sitting.

There's a lot to respect about ""Gettysburg."" It's a story about how war was fought in the 19th century and the men who engaged in it, pure and simple. There are no female cast members, no forced romances. The creators did an admirable job of taking a 3-day battle, plus its set-up, and condensing it into an informative and fairly compelling long movie. 

One aspect I liked was seeing the officers and soldiers pray while standing in line right before significant engagements. Yeah, it's hard to be an atheist when you're about to walk straight into friggin' cannon fire where bodies are literally blown to pieces. I also appreciated the subtle Civil War trivia thrown in, like how the soldiers had to march across the American landscape from one battle to another, carrying heavy rifles in the heat of the summer, and how the Confederates didn’t have enough boots for their soldiers. Meanwhile the postscripts about all the main characters are informative and appreciated. 

Unfortunately the movie’s bloated, sappy and sometimes lethargic. While the score is mostly good, sometimes great, there are some annoyingly ""heroic"" or melodramatic pieces. General Armistead’s incessant blathering about his bromance with a general on the other side needed toned down a notch. Still, if I concentrate to pay attention to the dialogue and non-action events in the film, I get a lot out of it. In other words, if you're braced for its shortcomings it's worth checking out. But don't expect something great, like ""Glory"" (1989) or the wrongly maligned prequel “Gods and Generals” (2003). 

The battle of Gettysburg took place July 1-3, 1863 and was a huge victory for the North, the turning point of the war, along with Grant's simultaneous siege of Vicksburg. After the failure of Pickett's Charge, General Lee and his troops retreated back to their own territory. The war would go on for almost two more years as the Confederates continued to put up an incredible courageous fight, but the odds were against them because the North had the numbers and resources, not to mention Ulysses S. Grant. Gettysburg and Vicksburg were the seeds of their impending doom.

General Meade congratulated his men for driving the Confederate invaders from the North's turf. But President Lincoln was upset because he wanted Meade to DESTROY Lee's army, not allow them to safely retreat back to their Southern sanctuary. Lincoln groaned: "" 'Drive the invader from our soil'? My God, is that all?"" 

Four months after the battle of Gettysburg, on November 19th, Lincoln came to the small town and gave his potent 'Gettysburg Address' to honor the fallen soldiers and motivate continued Northern commitment and victory. So many people died at Gettysburg they were STILL burying the dead (!).

The cut I saw runs 4 hours, 14 minutes, but there’s a director’s cut that is several minutes longer. The film was shot at Gettysburg & the Adams County region of Pennsylvania.

Needful Things is directed by Fraser C. Heston and is adapted for the screen by W.D. Richter from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Max von Sydow, Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, J. T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. The community of Castle Rock in Maine is all a tizzy when a new curio gift shop called Needful Things opens its doors. The proprietor is the mysterious Leland Gaunt (Sydow), who agrees to part with special goods in return for the buyer playing pranks on somebody in the community. Pranks that will have far reaching consequences for everyone in Castle Rock. 

To enjoy Needful Things a number of factors will need to be taken into consideration: have you read the book, do you like the book, do you even like Stephen King as a rule and are you expecting another adaptation like Misery (1990)? I wouldn't dream of trying to sell this as a great King adaptation for the big screen, because it's not, but that's no great surprise since great King adaptations seem to come around about as often as Halley's Comet! But it does have much going for it as a time filling piece of entertainment. The book was a door stopper (I personally thought it was great), but Heston (son of Chuck) and Richter have trimmed off the edges and condensed the core aspects of the book into what is now a two hour movie (it was originally a three hour cut). The result is a pacey piece of devilment that's flecked by horror as it sneakily observes human foibles. 

Boasting a better budget that's normally afforded a middle tier King adaptation, Needful Things also benefits from being able to assemble a very strong cast. And on the money they are too. Sydow has a great time, relishing another chance to play charismatic villainy and Harris as the Sheriff is a bastion of hard working honest Americana. Among the supporting cast of the unstable variety, Amanda Plummer nails the role of timid waitress Nettie Cobb, playing it like a coiled spring waiting to unwind, while J. T. Walsh (always value for money as a character actor) does a neat line in corporate bully boy loony on the edge. It's here with the number of characters in the story that the negative flip side of the film shows its hand. With the trimming and cutting comes the inevitable absence of character development, something that is evident both in the book and the film's extended form. So here's the final question on if you can enjoy the film: can you accept lack of depth in the narrative to get a brisker film? 

As it stands it asks a lot from its audience, and without doubt it doesn't have all the answers. But if entering with average expectations, and able to answer yes and no in the right places to the questions posed above? You might just enjoy this more than you thought possible at the outset. 6.5/10",6.0
10657,"**_What if the devil literally came to town?_**

What would happen if satan actually visited an American town, albeit undercover? In this case it's a small New England coastal village (shot in British Columbia). Ed Harris plays the main protagonist while Bonnie Bedelia appears as his girlfriend, and Max Von Sydow is on hand as the mysterious shopkeeper who moves into town and causes havoc by selling the villagers their most deepest desires for the price of a ""deed."" So, what would happen if the devil came to town? Would he make it a heathen paradise? A fun, hedonistic haven? Not bloody likely.

Like all Stephen King films based on his books, ""Needful Things"" (1993) takes place in a small town and has a comic book air. It borrows the concept used in ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" (1983) and makes a more compelling flick.

Since the movie utilizes biblical themes I'll consider it from that perspective for the sake of reviewing. According to the bible, the blessing of the Lord produces the qualities of the Garden of Eden, that is, paradise, which is why it says that the kingdom of heaven is a matter of righteousness, peace, joy and power. By contrast, the devil's kingdom produces un-righteousness, strife, war, anxiety, depression, misery, bondage and helplessness.

The fictional town of Castle Rock was a veritable haven before Leland Gaunt (Sydow) moved to town. Sure, there were the typical petty dislikes and rivalries, etc. but, generally speaking, it was a nice place to live, a small coastal paradise, which is what motivated Ed Harris' character to live there. Of course, Gaunt is intent on changing all this.

I just find it interesting the way the new shopkeeper slowly turns the town into a literal living hell. He utilizes the people's petty dislikes, paranoias and jealousies against them.

""Needful Things"" may not be great and it's definitely not scary, but it's effective in a theological sense as a creepy satanic take-over through simple manipulation of human nature. 

The theatrical version runs 2 hours and the TV version 3 hours. I've never seen the latter, but I'm sure it's the better version in that it further fleshes out the characters.

10658,"_**The infamous film version of Steve Gerber’s intelligent, wise-cracking waterfowl from another world**_

An English-speaking duck from another planet is somehow transported to Cleveland, Ohio, where he befriends a rock group leader (Lea Thompson). She introduces him to her friend, a quirky lab assistant (Tim Robbins), to figure out what happened, but the situation is complicated when a doctor at the lab is possessed by a “dark overlord of the universe” (Jeffrey Jones).

""Howard the Duck"" (1986) is the film version of Marvel Comics’ anthropomorphic waterfowl created by writer Steve Gerber and artist Val Mayerik with the Duck’s first appearance being in Adventures into Fear #19 featuring the Man-Thing, which debuted in March, 1974 (cover date Dec. 1973). While the cartoonish character was atypical for Marvel, he was a surprise hit, which led to this movie a dozen years later.

It’s made in the mold of “Ghostbusters” (1984) and obviously influenced “Men in Black” (1997), but it’s the least of these and notoriously bombed at the box office. It begins well enough, both intriguing and amusing, but starts to lose its mojo in the second act before spiraling into a loud, frantic last act with loads of colorful special effects. 

The problem is that, after the first act, the flick abandons the characters for action-oriented zaniness and it loses the attention of the viewer. Creator Steve Gerber plainly said the movie “sucked” and was dissatisfied with the duck’s bland voice and costume. Howard’s face just isn’t animated enough and his eyes are too cute & innocent for Gerber’s ill-tempered, wise-cracking waterfowl. That said, there are enough entertaining elements in the “Ghostbusters” / “Men in black” vein to enjoy the movie to some degree as you revisit 1985 America when it was shot. But you have to be able to accept it as a cinematic alternative to Gerber’s original concept.

I’m not big on Lea Thompson, but she’s winsome enough as Beverly on the female front, although she didn’t exactly fit Gerber’s version of the Duck’s babelicious pal. Liz Sagal is also notable as Ronette in a minor role.   

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was obviously shot in the Bay area of Northern California, NOT Cleveland, Ohio.

10665,"Upon first viewing, _The Strangers_ was one of only two films I'd seen that actually ever frightened me as an adult (well, a seventeen year-old, but close enough). To be fair, both films I'd seen in the same setting - alone, the middle of the night, in the aptly named ""Suicide Flats"", and what's more, I've since re-watched _The Strangers_ a couple of times and realised that both my fear, and my enjoyment, were perhaps a bit overstated on that first viewing. Even taking that into account though, and seeing it again almost a decade after that first time, I still honestly believe that _The Strangers_ is a good movie, with some pretty genuinely creepy elements.

I remember seeing this, as it first came out, and even though I enjoyed it, it didn't really stick with me. Nothing overwhelming, but a nice watch. Liv Tyler does a fine job here, but for most of the time she is alone in the house, and the movie becomes quite repetitive after a while. Once we get to the killers, most people were so excited about the reason, they did all this. Because 'Kristen' was home! Seriously? Who would have thought? Isn't that the same reason, why 'Jason Voorhees' kills people all around 'Camp Crystal Lake'? Because they are there? But I get it. The point is, that the killers have no other motivation than just to attack random people. There is no desire for money or jewelery... just the pure lust to take lives. But that is a motivation, most serial killers have, and therefore it doesn't seem all that special. When the movie becomes bloody towards the end, I really loved it though. It is nice, to see a movie like this acted by someone, who is as well known as Liv Tyler, and also Scott Speedman was totally fine. ""The Strangers"" is a fine little home invasion movie, but most certainly it doesn't deserve this extreme hype.",7.0
10669,"This was remarkable and scared the crap out of me. I read the book eons ago, probably 1988, for a first-year university class back when I was earning my first degree. Not a Burt Reynolds fan, and having only seen two other works by Boorman (the great 'Point Blank' and the not-so-great 'Exorcist II: The Heretic'), I wasn't in a huge hurry to rush out and see the film. BIG mistake on my part, to be frank.

Probably the gifted 83-year-old, Surrey native and five-time Oscar nominee's best work--and easily the finest work ever done by Reynolds, shortly before he simply rested on his laurels and became nothing but a caricature. THIS at the very least was proof that he at one time actually had chops and could act.

The scariest aspect of all is that this goes on all the time and we just don't know about it. Hundreds of people go 'missing' every day. And, as a Canadian, it's people like the culprits in this film that are responsible for America now having the worst Presidential candidate of all time actually having a chance of being the head of the most powerful country in the world.

10669,"Brutal, Beautiful and Brilliant.

Four Atlanta friends - Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Ed (John Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty), and Drew (Ronny Cox) – decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River out in the Georgia wilderness. They see it as a test of manliness whilst also wanting to experience this part of nature before the whole valley is flooded over to make way for the upcoming construction of a dam and lake. But the perils of nature are not the only dangerous things in their midst, unfriendly wood folk are about to bring another dimension in terror.

Deliverance is one of those films that sometimes suffers by way of reputation. Much like Straw Dogs and 70s films of that type, the hype and promise of unremitting hell often isn't delivered to an expectant modern audience. Which is a shame since Deliverance is one of the finest, glummest, brutalistic and beautiful films of the 1970s.

Adapting from James Dickey's novel (screenplay duties here also), British director John Boorman crafts a tough and powerful film of men out of their environment, thus out of their league. As each man sets off initially, it's a test of manhood, but each guy is forced to deconstruct their worth, and it soon becomes more about survival as this deadly adventure proceeds. Boorman, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, has painted a raw and treacherous landscape, unconquered by city slickers but dwelt in by inbreds who don't take kindly to the city folk showing up with their machismo attitudes. From the first point of contact with the strange locals, where Drew goes ""duelling banjos"" with an odd looking child, the film doesn't let up, much like the locals themselves, the film also is remorseless. Some critics over the years have proclaimed that Deliverance is too pretty, mistaking lush physicality as something detracting from the dark thematics at work. Not so, the Chattooga River sequences are electrifying, the rapids scenes (brilliantly filmed with Voight and Reynolds doing real work, and getting real injuries) are merely setting up the unmanning of our ""macho"" guys just around the corner. It's a fabulous and potent piece of ""beauty"". With the four cast leaders absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. In fact there are few better casting decisions ever than that of Reynolds as Lewis, one can only lament that he didn't have more hard edged serious roles in his career.

Minor itches exist, metaphors are heavy (Vietnam a 70s staple it seems) while ecological concerns are hinted at without being as prominent as they are in the novel. Surveying the landscape during the opening of the piece, Lewis reflects that man is going to rape this land, rape it, it's stuff like that that is not totally formed, given way to abject horror and survival, Lewis again noting that survival is the name of the game. A game of life and death, where man's primal being means violence may indeed beget violence. Boorman clearly agreed. 10/10",10.0

10669,"**It would certainly have been more interesting at the time it was released.**

When this film came out in 1972, there was something interesting about themes linked to nature and the environment. Not that environmentalism was in vogue, but it was the golden age of the hippie movement that advocated, among other things, a more harmonious connection between Man and Nature. And in fact, what we have here is a group of four men from the big city who seek to find fun, emotions and beauty in the natural environment, in a wild river full of rapids that will disappear in a few months due to the construction of a dam. However, as they begin their descent down the river, things begin to go terribly wrong after an encounter with two men.

Fitting into that type of nature thrillers where man faces the dangers of Nature or hostile people, it is one of those films that I cannot understand how it was nominated for three Oscars (Best Film, Best Director and Best Editing). It's not memorable at all, and the proof is that, outside the USA, no one remembers it. John Boorman, who directs, gives us a work full of tension and brutality, which takes away all our comfort and makes us grit our teeth. That is great! However, the director did not overcome the difficulties caused by the low budget in the best way and the film always has a cheap and “second-rate” look, whether in terms of props, sets and costumes, or in the unpleasant cinematography, with washed out colors and without glare, lack of contrast and shadows. Even the celebrated banjo soundtrack seemed ugly and tiring to me.

If there is a saving value that makes this film worthy of attention, it is the quality that we observe in the work of the main actors. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox are excellent in their respective roles and give their all to this project. I especially liked Voight, who exudes charisma and energy. And although I can eventually talk a little about the good work of Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward, the fact is that the film completely lacks a quality secondary cast to support the four main actors. Before finishing, a note about the film's title: I was truly taken aback by the original title, in English. “Deliverance” could be the title of the original literary work on which the film is based, however, if we consider that this film never explains it and that we never clearly understand the title, perhaps it would have been a good idea to come up with a clearer title.",3.0

Then off they go, and a perilous game of brutal cat-and-mouse with the locals ensues. They become the hunted, and ""Ed"" (Jon Voight), ""Lewis"" (Burt Reynolds) and especially ""Bobby"" (Ned Beatty) are ill-prepared for the ""welcome"" they are to get from a cunningly violent community that sees them as sport. With the river running fast and the terrain very much playing into the hands of their antagonists, it's a real battle for survival - and just what will these men have to do. It's a story of resilience, this one, and this quartet of actors each bring quite different aptitudes as their characters' worst fears are realised. The photography is perfect and coupled with the sparse, increasingly earthy and panic-stricken, dialogue helps keep the potency of the menace of their situation effective without the slightest certainty as to the outcome.

10670,"Wrong psychological profile, Harry. I'm not in this for kicks.

Rollercoaster is directed by James Goldstone and co-adapted to screenplay by Sanford Sheldon, Richard Levinson and William Link from a suggested Tommy Cook story. It stars George Segal, Timothy Bottoms, Richard Widmark, Harry Guardino, Susan Strasberg and Helen Hunt. A Panavision/Technicolor production in Sensurround, it features music by Lalo Schifrin and photography by David M. Walsh.

A psychopathic bomber known only as ""Young Man"" (Bottoms) is causing terror at American theme parks. When safety inspector Harry Calder (Segal) is brought in to investigate, it sets off a cat and mouse game as the ""Young Man"" ups the ante...

Even now Rollercoaster is still wrongly being lumped in with the disaster movie genre that surfaced in the 1970s. Released at a time when that particular genre of film was fading out, Rollercoaster is anything but a disaster movie. What it is, in fact, is a psychopath character based thriller that adheres to procedural values and character involvement. As it runs at nearly two hours in length should notify viewers that it isn't a film chocked full of Rollercoaster sequences and explosive pyrotechnics. Yes, there's some exciting ""Coaster"" sequences, neatly shown to us in POV, and in spite of the (obvious 1970s) use of dummies for the plot set up carnage, this thrives on human interest and race against the clock suspense.

The marker is set early on as Bottoms' smirking killer sets up his first murderous act whilst listening to some deathly string arrangement on his cassette player. We then segue into funfair music as the joys of the amusement park brings a warmth and calm to the viewer, this however is soon vanquished as the terror that a terrorist can bring comes right to the fore. From here on in the Bottoms character remains mysterious, but we now know just what he is capable of. Likewise does Segal's character, as do the likes of Widmark's Agent Hoyt and the rest of the ""suits"" frantically scratching around trying to avert further tragedy as the fresh faced bomber demands money with menaces. This ensures the bulk of the film is made up of Calder and Young Man interactions and police procedural movements. It has much talk, very much so, but it's well scripted dialogue and heightens the tension as we enter the final third.

One of the few films to feature the Sensurround gimmick, the film perhaps logically loses much impact on the small screen. Prints of the film are only adequate, and the sound mix doesn't shake your lounges in the way it certainly did back in 1970s theatres. Yet this is still a damn fine suspense picture, a pic that also carries with it some stoic performances from Segal and Widmark - and a chillingly effective villainous turn from the undervalued Bottoms. Henry Fonda is on the credits, but really it's just an early cameo appearance, while there's much interest value in watching future Academy Award winner Helen Hunt as the young daughter of Harry Calder.

Expect a taut thriller like ""Two-Minute Warning"", which was released the previous year, and you hopefully will not feel at all let down. Expecting a two hour disaster movie full of Coaster Carnage, however, will only lead to a crushing disappointment. 8/10",8.0

During a snowstorm at Lincoln International Airport in Chicago, the manager of the airport (Burt Lancaster) works overtime to clear the main runway of a Boeing 707 that’s stuck in the snow while dealing with his failing marriage. Meanwhile the next flight to Rome piloted by his brother-in-law (Dean Martin) has a suspicious person with an attaché case on board (Van Heflin). George Kennedy plays the head mechanic, Jean Seberg a customer relations agent, Jacqueline Bisset a flight attendant and Helen Hayes a stowaway.    

""Airport"" (1970) was the movie that kicked-off the disaster craze of the 70s. It’s not great like “The Poseidon Adventure” (1972), but it’s more compelling and less bloated than “The Towering Inferno” (1974). The soap operatic first half paves the way for the disaster-oriented second. It’s intentionally old-fashioned and was a huge hit at the box office. I wasn’t sure about it for the first 20 minutes, but I then found myself involved in the characters and their story, keeping my interest till the end.

After disaster films developed a bad rap years later, Lancaster panned “Airport” as the “worst piece of junk ever made,” which is ironic considering it was his most successful movie at the box office BY FAR.  

The film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes, and was shot at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Minneapolis, and Universal Studios, Universal City, California.

What now ensues is a break-neck course in how avarice; manipulation; a certain degree of luck and loads of sheer brass neck take him from being a bit of an home boy, to living in a fancy loft apartment, bathing in champagne and alienating both his erstwhile colleagues and his working class father ""Carl"" (Martin Sheen). It is only when a scheme that involves that latter man's airline employer is front and centre on planet ""Gekko"" that the young man starts to realise what's happening and with the help of Briton ""Sir Larry Wildman"" (a rather too plausible Terence Stamp) changes course a little.

2020 brings us yet another Disney's live-action remake. After new versions of The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and many others, now comes the time for Mulan. Therefore, I decided to go back in time and relive one of the latest installments of the Disney Renaissance Era. As a kid, even though I was (and I still am) far from being someone impacted by the Chinese culture, I always enjoyed the movie for its story, characters, and of course, its memorable score. However, for some reason, it never became one of those Disney classics I revisit every year. This might very well be only my 5th time watching this film, which for someone born in the 90s like me, feels weirdly short.

This is probably the first time I watch Mulan since I was an innocent young teenager, so I was definitely intrigued to see if my overall opinion would change a lot or not. Well, enough of the suspense, I love it! I appreciate it a lot more than when I was a kid, without a single doubt. In fact, if I could only choose one movie to be remade in the live-action format, Mulan would be my ultimate choice, simply due to its epic and cinematic feel. Not trying to take away from the compelling story and incredible characters, but when it comes to live-action, Mulan has everything to deliver a chill-inducing visual spectacle. This film proves how 2D animation can feel so powerful and emotionally overwhelming.

As with every movie from the Disney Renaissance Era, the animation looks gorgeous. Dozens of jaw-dropping shots resemble the epic scope of Lord of the Rings. The action sequences are incredibly riveting and innovative, placing the main character in situations where she needs to act smart. Jerry Goldsmith's music plays a vital part in the narrative. Not only it develops characters in a meaningful way, but it helps the story move forward with fun and entertaining songs. Once again, the action set pieces are also elevated by this score, which offers a whole other cinematic layer. Technically, Mulan is one of Disney's best animated flicks ever.

However, as usual, the two pillars of any film are what people end up saving in their hearts and memory: story and characters. With so many writers attached to screenplay credits, I'm genuinely surprised Mulan has such a well-written, well-structured, emotionally resonating narrative. Packed with culturally significant storylines, it's hard not to feel enthralled by Mulan's (Ming-Na Wen) arc. A daughter who goes to war by stealing her old father's spot, protecting him from certain death, while also trying to honor her family. A woman who wants to be more than just a wife to some man. Fighting against the menacing Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army, but also against condescending stereotypes and ancient society rules.

Ming-Na Wen gives Mulan a powerful voice worth remembering. After more than twenty years, her journey is still an inspiring tale not only to every woman and young girl on the planet, but to everyone who lays eyes on this movie. Captain Li Shang (BD Wong) also has his own arc of trying to prove himself worthy of being called Captain. Against all the odds, he still trains his troops and honors his own father. Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Yao (Harvey Fierstein), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo) are hilarious, but also essential to help save China from the enemy. Shan-Yu works perfectly as an intimidating presence, even though his motivations follow the generic villain formula.

Now, prepare yourselves because my only issue with the film might be a hot take. I'm sure that as a kid, I loved Mushu and all of his jokes. He also has a compelling storyline in the same way as other characters. However, watching the film now, I can only hear Eddie Murphy perform a few jokes like a standup routine. When I listen to Mushu, I don't think ""oh, that's Mushu"". I think ""that's Eddie Murphy"". It's a remarkably somber, dark movie to match Disney's trademark humor, so the tone's balance must be perfect for it to work. Mushu might bring the necessary levity with a lighthearted joke here and there, but overall, he's the main reason why sometimes the film loses track of when to take things seriously and when to be funny.

All in all, Mulan is one of the most culturally significant animated classics that Disney possesses. Even after two decades, its story inspires every single person who sets eyes in this magnificent piece of cinema. Its emotionally compelling narrative is packed with epic action sequences elevated by a memorable score, which also helps develop characters and carry the story forward. The eponymous character's arc still resonates with many people today: a journey of proving one's self-worth, family, and breaking stereotypes. With a terrific voice cast, almost every character holds a captivating storyline with their own clear motivations. Visually, it has a cinematic feel that no other Disney animated flick owns. Tonally, the balance could be better. The tragic, somber, dark war is present throughout the whole runtime, and while some levity and humor are definitely welcome, some jokes stand out as unnecessary, and Eddie Murphy's Mushu is way too silly during certain moments. Having in mind the target audience, one can't complain too much. It's a little nitpick in an otherwise phenomenal movie, one that I recommend to every reader so that you can all be inspired by it like so many people all around the world.

A different animal to the Halloween films that preceded and followed it, Season of the Witch is slowly but surely gaining an appreciation as a standalone horror film.

Kneale would take his name off the credits when the studio tampered with his vision, a shame because his core essence remains -  even if Cochran as a Warlock Wicker Man type could well have been genius.

With John Carpenter and Debrah Hill over seeing things from their production chairs, the picture had supervision of some standing. Tommy Lee Wallace maybe directing but it feels like a Carpenter movie, from Dean Cundey’s photography -  Carpenter’s foreboding synth musical score – and the sharpness of the horror scenes (which are excellent), it’s not hard to see the “non Michael Myers” Halloween series  that Carpenter had envisaged after part 2 had been and gone. 

Boosted by an irritatingly potent advertisement jingle (a Silver Shamrock variation on London Bridge is Falling Down) that counts down the days to Halloween and the day of carnage, Season of the Witch is consistently gnawing away at the senses. Having Atkins and O’Herlihy propping up the acting helps, both are reliable performers for this material, while the race against time finale has edge of the seat credentials.

It doesn’t all work of course, there’s some drag and the narrative feels schizophrenic at times, while if it wasn’t for Cundey’s camera work then Wallace’s inept direction of scenes would be over exposed. Yet as it asks Halloween franchise fans some forgiveness for not actually being part of the franchise, it delivers a smart sci-fi horror hybrid that’s not without shock and awe. 7/10",7.0
10676,"I distinctly remember being in Grade 8 when the film came out, and for four major reasons: 1) The excellent TV commercial, with John Carpenter's spooky music and the spider crawling out of the mouth of the mask; 2) The decent book adaptation written for young adults, that I read at the time, and thoroughly enjoyed; 3) Karen Carpenter died of a heart attack from anorexia nervosa; and 4) Major songs on the radio around that time were 'Centerfold' by The J. Geils Band and 'Bette Davis Eyes' by Kim Carnes. Though I had not yet seen the previous two films and wasn't old enough (the R-rating, and my parents were somewhat strict about that kind of thing), I really wanted to see it, but over the years, I never really got around to it, until recently I found used the entire 'Halloween' franchise on a 10-blu ray pack, and no longer have any sort of excuse, really.

I loved Wallace's work in 'Stephen King's It' (except for the last half-hour, but that's probably the book's fault and not the director's) and I thought his 'Vampires: Los Muertos' was rather underrated, so an added attraction for me was to watch his directorial debut here. He impressed me. I enjoyed the film and all of the extras on its blu ray very much. If you like horror films at all, you should watch this. 

Protagonists Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin are very good here, and I liked Dan O'Herlihy even better than when I had previously seen him in 'The Virgin Queen', 'Imitation of Life', 'The Cabinet of Caligari', 'Good Against Evil' and the first two 'RoboCop' films, and, as always, Dean Cundey provides excellent cinematographical work and the soundtrack by Carpenter and Alan Hogarth is dependably solid. Don't bother with the negative reviews that came out at the time the film was released: Most people were upset that the film didn't have Michael Myers in it, and didn't give it a chance. Find out for yourself--in my humble opinion, it's worth both purchasing and at least a rewatch.",8.0

10676,"Wait, what? Halloween? I guess Carpenter had the grandiose idea of expanding the franchise to one movie released around Halloween that was kind of about Halloween...the holiday not the movies.

Mike did die in Halloween II. It was a good idea, one year, one horror movie, all under the same anthology franchise.

Except the audience, after two stellar slasher films wanted Mike, so best laid plans of mice and men and all that.

What we got instead of Mike was a movie that would have been a halfway decent stand alone end of the 70s horror film, one that was atmospheric, moody, and though it was too flawed to be big, it would have been a fair enough start to the franchise...it would have made a bit of money for the seasonal scare fair.

Except....it was called ""Halloween III"" and all the publicity in the world wouldn't have stopped the public from expecting Mike.

So, ""robbed"" would be the best phrase to describe how one feels whilst watching this film.

Even now after knowing what it was intended to be...still feel a little robbed. And I am a fan of anthology series, I feel it lets writers and directors tell unique little stories that wouldn't otherwise be made.

10676,"**The biggest problem with this film, full of problems, is the title.**

After seeing this film, I felt the need to read things about it to understand why it is so strange and different from the previous two. The conclusion I reached is the simplest: if there had been another title and no relation to the “Halloween” franchise, I would have had better luck. If we forget the title and put aside our initial expectations, if we try to evaluate it for what it is, it doesn't seem so bad, although it is far from being a film that I would like to see twice.

If you tell me that it is absolutely horrible because it has no relation to its two predecessors, I would have to agree. After two successful films, it was predictable that the public would create expectations, this also happened to me. However, there had to be a logical reason for the film to differ from the others, and the reason is simple: John Carpenter, who at the time owned the rights to the franchise, did not want to make a franchise around the same villain, but a series of totally different movies around Halloween. When being coerced into reusing the villain and continuing the story in “Halloween 2”, he killed him at the end so that he could not be reused, this film being a return to the filmmaker's original plan. What Carpenter failed to understand was what the public wanted, and the dismal failure of this film was solely a result of that lack of understanding.

Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, who wrote the script together with Carpenter, it has the master's inspiration throughout. The story he tells us is quite creative, it is something original, but it is not a good story. The predictability of the plot is a problem right from the start, so that we already know the film long before we reach the end. The quality of the dialogues seems to vary a little, it is not constant, and the added sci-fi elements seem to be there too much, perhaps more due to the enormous popularity that this genre of fiction acquired at the time than for any real benefit to the plot and the final work. Another problem is the poor conception of the characters, without any ability to empathize with the public, without any relationship with each other and with several stupid situations: for example, the bizarre and cold way in which a character behaves after the strange death of her father, going to the point of getting involved with a woman he doesn't know that well. And this becomes even stranger if we consider the terrible performances of an amateur cast, in which only Dan O’Herlihy manages to stand out in the slightest.

Technically, the film has some points in its favor, starting with high quality cinematography and sets, good filming and good props. The sound effects can be a little too intrusive in some scenes, but in compensation we have a good set of special and visual effects, especially the androids and the entire final part, where they are used more abundantly. The soundtrack is also very good and creates a tense atmosphere that the film manages to manage reasonably.",3.0

10677,"<em>'Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights'</em> is surprisingly watchable.

I was expecting a rather tame and boring return to the world of <em>'Dirty Dancing'</em>, though it actually produces a fine dance romance flick. Of course compared to the excellent and far superior original it is a downgrade, but for what it is I had a decent time watching.

Romola Garai and Diego Luna have solid enough chemistry onscreen, while John Slattery offers firm support. Sela Ward is alright, not helped by how the makers chose to portray her character - Jeannie becomes quite irredeemable at one point, with the film's attempts to 'fix' that totally failing to convince. That's about it for cast positives, though it was neat to see a familiar face from the 1987 flick appear.

The dance and Cuban revolution parts of the story don't mesh amazingly, a bit forced perhaps, but all in all I'd say they just narrowly made it work. I will say the dancing numbers and soundtrack aren't as good as they could've/should've been, yet I did still appreciate a few bits of music: the intro piece and the use of Wyclef Jean's <em>'Dance Like This'</em>, I never knew until now that that latter track was the original of Shakira's <em>'Hips Don't Lie'</em> - you learn something new every day!",7.0
10679,"This is a difficult movie to rate, at least for me. It certainly had its funny, even hilarious, moments but at the same time it was incredibly stupid and silly at times.

The idea of the Nazi’s having fled to the moon and built a secret moon-base there was a rather original I think. On could of course wonder why, if they had that technological advantage already 1945, everything is still looking like 1945 now, why they did not have computers, even why they lost the war in the first place? But let us not get picky now…it is a comedy movie after all.

There are quite a few funny moments. Most of them involving their stupor when seeing a black American astronaut and their subsequent dealing with him. Unfortunately there are also quite a few incredibly stupid and silly moments. Their depiction of the American present, her PR-people and most things revolving around here was not really very funny, just stupid. I do not mind a movie that makes fun of the American president but in this movie it was not very intelligently done, just silly. Also, using a Sarah Palin look-alike was just cheap not to mention that such a joke is lost only a few years later when no one has a clue who Sarah Palin was.

The special effects where quite cool, at least when considering that it was “only” a comedy movie after all and even more so considering the movies minimal budget. The Nazi’s steampunk-like contraptions where rather fun to watch. 

In all I would say that the movie managed to place itself in the enjoyable range, barely, but I cannot bring myself to give it a more than fairly average rating.",5.0
10679,"Well I can't call it different. I've never actually seen a movie with a plot like this, but it did feel exactly like a low budget cheap drive in comedy/sci-fi show and...kudos.

The best part about this is that, at no point in time, does it take itself seriously. It knows exactly what kind of movie it is and delivers the goods without any pretense, without any attempt to be a better film.

It seems like everyone involved knew the score and did their parts to sell the movie for what it is, and not what they think it could be.

So, what you have is a comedy that is ferociously entertaining. It's a stupid plot with a cheesy script and equally inane characters and it pulls it off brilliantly.

The end result is, when you sit down to watch it, you're going to laugh and be entertained and the time is going to fly by.

10680,"Better than <em>'D2: The Mighty Ducks'</em>.

I rate <em>'D3: The Mighty Ducks'</em> more than that aforementioned sequel, but even so it's still a pretty lacklustre follow-up. The original is entertaining, none of the sequels are in my opinion. I, perhaps, like the premise to this one most, though I will say there's something about it that doesn't quite fit in with the trilogy itself.

Emilio Estevez is, at least partially, in this third film. He evidently couldn't give enough time to it, you can hardly blame him to be fair. He's decent in what he gives. As he magically disappears at times, Heidi Kling (Casey) and Joss Ackland (Hans) magically reappear. Neither were in the first sequel oddly, yet come in like nothing has happened in this. As such, their storylines - particularly Hans' - don't hit all that strongly.

The young actors, at least in my eyes, give their best performances of the series here. I actually, properly, took notice of the likes of Joshua Jackson (Charlie) and Kenan Thompson (Russ). Elsewhere, Jeffrey Nordling (Ted) and Abraham Ford himself, Michael Cudlitz (Cole), are decent. A firmer plot makes the cast standout, who knew?!

10681,"""Wall-E"" stands out as Pixar at its finest, delivering a captivating story with minimal dialogue and a strong focus on the journey and bond between two robots. Despite the lack of extensive verbal communication, the film successfully conveys a heartfelt narrative centered around love and adventure.

Disney's bold approach to storytelling in ""Wall-E"" pays off, engaging viewers of all ages by emphasizing visual storytelling and drawing attention to the nuances of the characters' actions and emotions. By immersing audiences in a wordless narrative, the movie prompts viewers to invest in the story and characters on a deeper level, creating a more immersive and rewarding viewing experience.

The universe created in ""Wall-E"" and the development of its characters leave a lasting impact, establishing them as timeless and iconic figures that resonate with audiences long after the credits roll. However, one drawback is the lack of continuation or further exploration of these beloved characters beyond the initial film. Unlike many Disney classics that offer ongoing character development and glimpses into their lives over time, ""Wall-E"" leaves fans with no additional insights or follow-up stories to enrich the characters' journeys.

While ""Wall-E"" excels in creating a memorable and engaging story, the absence of further development or continuation for its characters leaves a sense of unfulfilled potential.

Sadly, though, the story itself is a little bit thin. Denzel Washington is tasked with investigating the worthiness of a deceased helicopter pilot during the Gulf war to receive the medal of honor. Assuming it would be a routine ratification, he interviews her crew only to find discrepancies and inconstancies that cast a shadow over the whole procedure. Had this just been a routine wartime tale, then it might have been ok - but the fact that it is based around a real wartime scenario, and married together with that sickly trumpet-based pseudo-military score and an annoyingly ""Semper Fi"" sort of mentality, the whole thing just sinks down into a mire of absurdity and sentimentality. Neither Denzel Washington nor Meg Ryan really have the weight to give this film any bite, oomph - or, for that matter, plausibility. Matt Damon makes some impact but I couldn't quite decide whether that was because he was good, or because it was interesting to see him before stardom set it in - but either way, this is pretty much devoid of action, and the dialogue could have been written by the US Army recruitment office.

10685,"The Watcher is about a tormented FBI agent and a deranged serial killer. For some reason, James Spader plays the former and Keanu Reeves the latter, when it’s obvious to anyone familiar with both actors’ careers that it should be the other way around.

Miscasting aside, Reeves sleepwalks through his role as if it were a contractual obligation – which it apparently was; if you believe his story, someone forged his signature on the contract. I’m going to go ahead and take that with a grain of salt; on the other hand, at least Reeves, unlike Spader, has an excuse, far-fetched though it may be.

Then again, it’s not like anyone involved in the making of this movie made an actual effort. Director Joe Charbanic and writers David Elliot and Clay Ayers adopt a lather-rinse-repeat approach toward the material. First thing in the morning, Reeves sends Spader a picture of a woman and gives him till nine o’clock that night to find her before he kills her. The following day they wake up and do it all over again.

The first time lacks suspense because it's too early in the game and we know Spader isn't going to catch Reeves so easily and quickly; moreover, the film is so formulaic and derivative (with shades of Reservoir Dogs and Blow-up, to name but a couple of examples) there is little hope of its throwing us a curve at any point.

Tigerland was the name of a U.S. Army training camp located at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Tagged as the second worst part of the Earth, it was a recreation of the Vietnamese jungle and was used to prepare American soldiers for the hellish terrain they were soon to be fighting in. 

Directed by Joel Schumacher, Tigerland stars Colin Farrell as Private Roland Bozz, a reluctant recruit to the war effort who upsets his superiors by having a canny knack for exploiting loop holes in the rule book. However, it's evident that Bozz has leadership qualities, but can the officers convince him he is born to lead? 

By the time of Tigerland's release, the Vietnam movie had apparently run its course. The announcement that Joel Schumacher was to delve into the conflict for his next movie was met with less than enthusiastic responses. This was after all the director who had not too long prior reduced the once darkly watchable Batman franchise to comedy campy ham overdrive. Alarm bells were further starting to go off when it was revealed that it was to be a short low budget shoot of 28 days, with a cast of unknowns and filmed in grainy 16 millimetre. Yet two things were forgotten by his many detractors. One was that Schumacher had showed himself capable of guiding a young vibrant cast to high levels of watch-ability (The Lost Boys), and two, that he had made Falling Down in the early 90s, thus tricky and darker edged material was not beyond him. 

Tigerland is a fine film, there is no actual conflict to observe other than the interactions between Bozz, his fellow squadies and his superiors. This is more boot camp drama than a film about military engagements. But the impact is much the same as our group of young men prepare for a fate that doesn't exactly have favourable odds; their respective reasons for being there in the first place containing varying degrees of bravado or disbelief. To which, much to his initial bemusement, Bozz simultaneously becomes a beacon of hope to many and a figure for revilement. The out-shot of this is that Tigerland winds up an expertly crafted movie, one that is propelled by great acting and one that quietly sneaks up on you and cloaks you in sadness. 

Schumacher is not the sole reason for why the film works so well though, he had some quality help. Ross Klavan and Michael McGruther's screenplay rises above the character clichés that exist in every army training camp based movie. Helped enormously by Klavan drawing on his real life experiences in the army, Tigerland doesn't hurtle towards its climax (a climax that is understated and poignant), it takes its time, characters are formed and with the then unknown Farrell on stupendously bewitching form, it's as engaging as a Vietnam film gets. This in spite of the grim look of the piece as Matthew Libatique's cinematography strips away vibrant colours and uses murky greys and greens to put the viewer right in there with them at boot camp. The look, the feel and the story all pull together nicely, making Tigerland fit to be mentioned in the same breath as those popular Vietnam movies from the previous decades. 8/10",8.0

Wow, I feel as if I've never seen this movie before: this is something that happens when you learn to watch movies critically and rewatch childhood favorites.

I'm continuously enlightened to how awful Walt Disney was.  This movie is filled with insensitive nonsense, particularly to Native Americans, and the majority of the characters are just awful people, to include Peter Pan and Tinkerbell.  Wendy is the only ""pure"" character in the entire movie, and I feel as if I'm reaching there.  Tiger Lily might be a competitor, but she doesn't DO much, so it's hard to tell.

With such a wonderful premise, and Disney's level of production value, you would think this would hold up, even after 70 years, but I honestly am beginning to think this was so widely accepted for a lack of options.

Don't get me wrong, the actual story is both ""close enough"" to the original story, and well enough structured that a reboot would probably be very close to this version.  It's all stylistic choices in both animation, dialogue, and character presentation that could easily be cleaned up, and likely should have been.

While I could probably rant for an hour just on the ""love"" triangle happening in this (I am completely in camp Tinkerbell), this is supposed to be ""boy who never grew up"".   While that lends to the jealousy factors, the amount and inconsistency of details on everything about the place being magical tends to distract from it.

You'll notice that Peter no longer has human ears, he has pixie ears, and the boys supposedly killed and skinned giant animals so they could wear their skins as pajamas: where are the rest of the animals?

The pirates have been there long enough to get restless, though there are enough of them left, despite Hook just shooting them dead on occasion, but not long enough to mutiny or properly search the one island, but long enough to have a weirdly specific history between Peter Pan and Hook and the crocodile.

Before you start watching, do bear in mind that JM Barrie created the ""Peter Pan"" character at the very start of the 20th century, so some of the language and roles are a touch on the stereotypical side - but that ought not to unduly spoil this experience. The ""Darlings"" are a loving, but pretty dysfunctional family with a huge great dog ""Nana"" whose three children all share the nursery in the attic of the family home. ""Peter"" visits and with the help of his friendly sprite ""Tinker Bell"" takes the youngsters on a series of magical adventures in ""Never Land"" where nobody ever grows up.

There's a bit of depth to the characterisations - the story might be a ""love"" story; but it is certainly one that introduces loyalty, trust, jealousy and comradeship to youngsters in a thoroughly engaging, plausible way. There is plenty of action too - a wonderful sword fight; lots of flying and the carefree attitude of the children is really quite contagious.

It's about redemption, people that you'd never would expect anything good out of are honestly capable doing some amazingly heroic things. People that you would expect to be honest are capable of the worst lies.

Branagh's directorial approach is ambitious and confident.  Filled with high excitement - quite an accomplishment when staging a 400 year old stage play told completely through dialogue.  His visual style certainly are more film than stage play, and his screenplay adaptation tightens the story, even with the inclusion of a scene that was originally from Shakespeare's **HENRY IV Part 2** to clarify the story.

More amazing, Branagh also portrays the Young King in a tremendous interpretation of the role.  Not only does his Harry fit organically into the story, his understanding of the language makes the story relatable to today's audiences without destroying the poetry.

Others in the regal cast include excellent performances  by Emma Thompson and Derek Jacobi as the omnipresent Chorus.  Many other performers will star in Branagh's later films as he seems to operate in a collaborative community approach.

The stunning musical score by Patrick Doyle cements what will become one of the greatest director / composer relationships.  Brash and operatic, the score is as capable of supporting the many battles as well as the intimate romantic scenes.

Obviously, Branagh's **HENRY V** will be compared to Olivier's film - a production that has not aged as well for today's audiences.  Olivier's production is bright and colorful with sets resembling a production of the Wizard of Oz. Branagh's film is gritty and dirty and brings viewer onto the bloody field of Agincourt.

The two boys are played by Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline. William Baldwin is on hand as a tennis instructor while Anna Paquin plays a college student.   

The story is unsurprisingly based on director/writer Noah Baumbach’s own family’s experience. I say “unsurprisingly” because the movie smacks of real life with its candid and sometimes comical approach.

A few viewers didn’t ‘get’ the father, Bernard Berkman (Daniels), and have interpreted him in an uber-negative way. Yes, he’s a grotesquely competitive, pompous cheapskate, but his comical flaws are rounded out by an inherent decency. He’s clearly not the unfaithful partner and wants to keep the family together. He takes the time to spend quality time with his boys and mentor them, especially Walt (Eisenberg), who idolizes him.  

Speaking of the father and Walt, Eisenberg and Daniel’s characters and their performances are the highlight of this picture. Both characters are fascinating psychological studies. Eisenberg possesses the intense, intelligent charisma of James McAvoy and Brando. Is it any wonder that he went on to play The Joker in the DCEU? Winsome Halley Feiffer is on hand as his girlfriend.

Speaking of females, Anna Paquin is another highlight even while her lack of modesty isn’t very becoming. Nevertheless she looks great in jeans.   

The movie runs 1 hour, 21 minutes and was shot in Brooklyn, New York.

This action packed sequel moves like a runaway train! William Friedkin's film was excellent - yet contained too many scenes of people sitting in cars watching other people go in and out of buildings - the stakeout scenes bring the film to a halt. The scenes were integral, yes, but they are a damn drag to sit through.

Frankenheimer's _French Connection II_ is a superbly acted and taut thriller that contains a substantial amount of humour too! The perfect movie.

Hackman's finest performance can be found here and his harrowing withdrawal from heroin is a wonder to behold.

10711,"This was never going to be as good as the first film, but as sequels go - especially in the 1970s - this isn't half bad. Gene Hackman's ""Popeye Doyle"" is doped up full of heroin, and abandoned to the streets. Luckily he is discovered and after some cold turkey, sets about getting back onto the trail of ""Charnier"" (Fernando Rey) in Marseille. It is here he must work with the French authorities - as suspicious of him, as he is of them - to effect a catch! Marseille is always a great venue for films like this - it has an earthily cosmopolitan seediness that really lends well to this kind of drama. Certainly, this plot lacks the intensity of the 1971 original, and ""Doyle"" frequently comes across here as a bit of an arrogant American ass, but the pace is still pretty good, and there is plenty of action to keep it lively for a couple of hours with car chases and shoot-outs a-plenty.",6.0
10714,"Very good.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this 1994 version of <em>'The Jungle Book'</em>, though I'm pleased to say it exceeded my expectations. It's a very different telling of Rudyard Kipling's work from what I've previously seen, which actually gives it a fresher feel. If we're comparing film adaptations, the 2016 remake is the better film.

I still thoroughly enjoyed this one though. I liked the switch-up of events, while the death scenes are excellent. Cast-wise it's strong, with Jason Scott Lee (Mowgli), Cary Elwes (William), Lena Headey (Katherine), Sam Neill (Geoffrey) and John Cleese (Julius) all appearing. Lee and Elwes are the standouts, but I rate all five of them.

The score is mostly alright, but some moments of it are superb; one part in particular reminded me, somewhat randomly, of television's <em>'The Crown'</em>. There are a few things that I can understand being deemed as downsides, those include the silent animals (voices wouldn't have worked here, imo) and obvious nature of the plot.

Pleasant film, one of the best adaptations of TJB that I've seen.",8.0
10714,"_**Mowgli Jones of the Jungle**_

From 1887 to the turn of the century a boy is raised by wolves in the jungles of India where Shere Khan the tiger dwells and threatens. With assistance from Baloo the bear and Bagheera the black panther, Mowgli (Jason Scott Lee) learns the ""Law of the Jungle” before going back to civilization and learning the strange ways and corruptions of humanity, as well as love. Sam Neill, Lena Headey, Cary Elwes and John Cleese are on hand.

""The Jungle Book"" (1994) mixes the sweet innocence of Rudyard Kipling's fables with “Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan” (1984) and Indiana Jones. Don’t expect talking animals as this is a relatively realistic adventure with some cute animal reactions, but not overdone. While I prefer “Greystoke” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” it’s at least on par with “Temple of Doom” and “The Last Crusade.” It needed more human interest to keep the attention of adults, but has enough I reckon.

Some people have complained that Jason Scott Lee was miscast, but it’s assumed Mowgli’s mother (whom we never see and died when he was born) was of Asian descent. Keep in mind that, geographically, Southeast Asia is right around the corner from the Indian subcontinent, not to mention Nepal/China to the north, and so mixed marriages weren’t exactly unheard of. Meanwhile Lee himself is a mix of Polynesian & Chinese blood. For the movie, making Mowgli part-Asian made him an outsider to both the British and the Indians, which works for me.

The beautiful Lena Headey does well in her role while Elwes is effective as the odious Brit snob. Lee, of course, kicks total axx while the live-action animals and spectacular locations are worth the price of admission. 

The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in Jodhpur in northwestern India (scenes featuring monkeys and elephants), as well as Bombay (Mowgli's urban interaction scenes), Tennessee (Fall Creek Falls & Ozone Falls) and South Carolina (Fripp Island & nearby Beaufort).

Along with the world of Walt Disney's ducks, ""The Muppets"" and the various productions of Hanna and Barbera, the ""Looney Tunes"" and ""Merry Melodies"" are the largest and most popular sets of North American animation cartoons. And when it comes to the Tunes, we know what's going to happen: there's going to be a lot of crazy animation, explosions and funny effects.

This film will please Tunes fans, putting the most adorable and iconic characters on the big screen, and giving the spotlight, of course, to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, the duo that is inseparable, even if they are always at odds. It all begins with the dismissal of Daffy and a human employee of the Warner studio, and will end in a kind of fight against evil, in support of the father of that employee who, in fact, is a secret agent in the image of James Bond. A seemingly crazy mix, but one that works thanks to the skill and irreverence of the Tunes.

I won't waste time talking about voice actors. The studio intelligently took advantage of those who usually voice these characters, so we are dealing with professionals who know very well what they do and what the characters ask of them. We have, however, an excellent comic performance by Brendan Fraser, who seems completely comfortable with what was asked of him and even seems to have fun with it all. Jenna Elfman isn't bad either, but she can't keep up with Fraser.

The movie is very good. It's pure entertainment, with classic touches that we're used to seeing in Tunes material. It's the case with that chase in the Louvre, or the various fights between Duffy and Bugs. Being a more humble and sympathetic film than Space Jam, I felt that it doesn't have the weight of excessive publicity against it, besides having a true comic actor in the main human role, and not an amateur trying to act it out.",6.0

And finally, Doritos...I can't remember what the Doritos tagline was, but they were delicious! Motorcycle enthusiast and all-around annoying gearhead Ford (Martin Henderson) is fresh back from tooling around Thailand, where he spent six months finding himself and hiding out from the law, who want him on drug charges. He looks up his old girlfriend Shane (Monet Mazur), who was harassed by FBI agents McPherson (Adam Scott) and Henderson (Justina Machado) looking for Ford. Villainous Henry (Matt Schulze) is also looking for Ford, trying to get some motorcycles back. Trey (Ice Cube) and his motorcycle gang have just turned down Henry's drug deal, brokered by Trey's ne'er-do-well brother Junior (Fredro Starr), who is promptly killed by Henry. Henry's scary Goth girlfriend China (Jamie Pressly) pins the murder on Ford. Ford, his two bland sidekicks whose names I didn't catch, and his equally bland girlfriend are soon on a desert run to Los Angeles, with the cops and Trey's gang hot on their trails.

If you can ignore your pounding headache and make it through this thing, there are some good points. Martin Henderson plays a nice leading man who is not perfect, I was reminded of Kurt Russell in ""Big Trouble in Little China."" Ice Cube has the best terminal scowl in the business- when he's unhappy, you believe it. Pressly is good as China in a too-small supporting role. Adam Scott is a riot as the unorthodox McPherson. But- some of the action scenes here must be seen to be believed. Other action scenes are beyond belief, even after being seen. The entire film is like one long video game, where all logic is tossed in favor of tons of impossible stunt work and a simplistic story my seven year old son could have dreamed up. It may have helped if I thought the cast and crew were in on a big joke, winking at the audience but there are too many wasted chances, and too many earnest performances, to make me think we are supposed to take all of this lightly. The idiotic product placement could have been played with a la ""Wayne's World 2,"" yet it also seems serious. In the end, ""Torque"" is just as loud and annoying as the motorcycles themselves. I found a few diamonds in the rough here and there, but the headache medication hasn't kicked in yet for me to recommend it.",4.0

And for me, that is a fairly short list, such as A Christmas Story and the ubiquitous It’s a Wonderful Life.

The script goes over the top a bit sometimes, resulting in cringeworthy moments for me, but it is harmless and easily forgiven. There is wit, pathos and sight gags galore. I like the chemistry between Will Farrell and Zooey, and it is a treat to have national treasures Ed Asner and Bob Newhart leading off the film as Santa and the Papa elf. James Caan and Mary Steenburgen are credible as Elf’s prospective new family in New York City.

So there is not a lot of depth to this movie, nor is there supposed to be. It is a great film to watch with friends or extended family.

Released in 2003 and directed by Jon Favreau, ""Elf"" is a Christmas dramedy/fantasy starring Will Farrell as an orphaned infant who stows away on Santa Claus' sleigh and isn't discovered until he's at the North Pole, where he's adopted by Papa Elf and named Buddy. After growing up as an elf, he travels to New York City to meet his father (James Caan) and starts a relationship with his neglected younger half-brother. He also starts a relationship with a department store worker (Zooey Deschanel) and helps spread Christmas cheer as Santa (Ed Asner) arrives to the city.

His adopted dad tells him something of his real parents and off to New Work he goes in search of his father ""Walter"" (James Caan) who had, hitherto, been completely unaware of this son's existence. Hard-nosed ""Walter"" is initially disinterested, but thanks to a photograph from years gone by, quickly decides to try and help his green-suited offspring to try and make his way in the world.

Can ""Buddy"" rally the troops - and avoid the menacing Central Park Rangers? This is a jolly and fun Christmas feel-good film that has weathered the last twenty years rather well. The sentiment is well layered, the humour works for all ages and Caan compliments the sometimes cringe-making effusiveness of ""Buddy"" - aided by sparing but kindly appearances from Mary Steenburgen - well.

In 1962, a lovely Maine author of a progressive female advice tome (Renée Zellweger) travels to New York City to publish her book whereupon an infamous playboy journalist (Ewan McGregor) strategizes to prove that she’s really just an Old Fashioned woman at heart. Sarah Paulson and David Hyde Pierce play the respective best friends while Tony Randall has a bit part.   

“Down With Love” (2003) is a satire of those Doris Day romcoms of the late 50s / early 60s that typically revolved around a battle of the sexes. While I’ve never seen any of those movies this is an amusing & cute spoof that pokes fun at ’em. 

Renée is adorable and McGregor rises to the challenge in an atypical role. The inclusion of Jeri Ryan & Melissa George on the feminine front is a plus. Unfortunately, the flick’s a tad too long for such fluff; 12-15 minutes shoulda been shaved off to give it more drive, but that’s just me.

Starring Adam Sandler and Damon Wayans, the former a criminal, the latter a cop, plot sees the mismatched pair thrust together to bring down a criminal kingpin (James Caan). So it's all set up nicely for a high energy action comedy from the realm of buddy buddy bonanza. Sadly it has energy to burn but the execution of the comedy is weak to the point the makers have to resort to the base level of comedy writing to try and get laughs. 

The odd line raises a chuckle, but quite often this is followed by a period of inanity, which in turn is followed by a ballsy action sequence (the makers very aware they quickly need to keep the demographic genre fans back on the clock). All this while a budding bromance - that's coupled with some lame homophobic undertones (a revolver up the butt gag? Seriously?) - threatens to turn it into the Brokeback Mountain of the buddy buddy action genre of film. Hell! the screenplay even has the whiff of misogyny about it. 

The stars are badly served by poor writing and direction, but they themselves are guilty of offering up a chemistry free movie that dulls the senses during all the interim talking sequences. It's hard to believe this is the same pair of actors who have The Wedding Singer and The Last Boy Scout on their respective curricula vitae. This is a waste of talent and a wasted opportunity for something fun and exciting. A pic only marginally saved by its shoot-outs and fisticuffs (for the so inclined of course).

As a young boy, Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) claims to have seen the fearsome Tooth Fairy kill his own mother. He also claims that having seen her, she wont stop until she also kills him. Years later, and still haunted by the experience of that night, Kyle must return to Darkness Falls to aid his childhood sweetheart, Caitlin Greene (Emma Caulfield) and her kid brother Michael, the latter of which who seems to be at risk from the Tooth Fairy this time around. Can Kyle confront his fears and end the 150 years of terror that has blighted Darkness Falls?

Pretty much despised by the discerning horror-phile, Darkness Falls, to me at least, is a creepy, interesting and totally enjoyable thriller/ghost picture worth reappraisals. From the excellent, and chilling opening credits (where we nicely have a back story to work from), to the final confrontation, Darkness Falls ticks most of the ghostly requisites that is asked of it. Scary demon (troubled children with night terrors should be explored more in cinema I feel), cannon fodder bullies, cannon fodder obnoxious coppers and a constant sense of unease and dread. All of which is provided in Jonathan Liebesman's (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"") film. It's with the sense of dread that I feel that this deserves a better reputation. Hand on my heart I know the film isn't a scary boo jump picture, something that is unforgivable to many genre supporters, but atmosphere goes a long way to creating a good thriller/ghost story picture. Darkness Falls has it in spades, and it's also a film that is a nice antidote to the blood beast torture sub-genre of film that seep out from the multi-plexes on a seemingly weekly basis.

Any expectation of an outright horror film should be quickly extinguished prior to a first time viewing, and if noise annoys and staccato editing bugs you? well stay away. Also don't line up if one demands great acting in a budget restricted piece such as this, since both Kley & Caulfield are only adequate at best. But give it a go if you understand that a preposterous plot, and preposterous set pieces are a pre-requisite for horror films of this type. I say that since I've seen many comments decrying Darkness Falls for the unbelievable elements - only to then search their other comments to find praise for even more ludicrously plotted pieces! Or give it a go knowing it's more about the creeping stalking menace side of horror, or that it's also an action thriller as well as an uneasy story. Maybe just maybe you will enjoy it for what it is? Otherwise I guess you will be looking forward to ""Hostel 22"" or another ""Jason Attacks The Eiffel Tower"" movie... 7/10",7.0

In the town of Darkness Falls (patterned after Fall River, Massachusetts), a kid named Kyle sees the legendary tooth fairy specter and is forced to go to an orphanage after his mother mysteriously perishes. Twelve years later, Kyle (Chaney Kley) returns to the town where the specter is wreaking havoc and he's jailed under false presumptions. Emma Caulfield plays the girl he left behind and Lee Cormie her little brother who has also seen the malevolent ghost and is therefore getting ""treatment.""

""Darkness Falls"" (2003) is a haunting ghost flick that starts out very promising, but fails to take advantage of its resources and potential. The movie is enhanced by a quality apparition and an eerie vibe, similar to ""The Ring"" from the previous year, not to mention a strong and sympathetic protagonist played by Kley (who would pass away in his sleep four years later due to a breathing problem). Emily Browning is excellent as the 13 year-old girlfriend in the prologue, but Caulfield doesn't capture the character as an adult, although she's okay. Unfortunately she's literally the only prominent female in the movie, which is scandalous for a horror flick of this ilk.

The movie takes a bad turn around the midpoint when Kyle (Kley) makes it to the hospital just as the boy is about to undergo an experimental procedure, which is ultra-contrived, and the film never recovers. In fact, it goes off the rails and totally loses interest. Another negative is that too much of the story takes place indoors. The few outside sequences are effectively atmospheric, but the bulk of the movie takes place in hospitals, houses, a police station and lighthouse.

While the music is good during the end credits, they run for literally ten minutes, which is curious long for a horror flick that only runs 86 minutes. So, really, the story is only 76 minutes long. ""Darkness Falls"" might still be worth checking out for those who value the above positives, just don't expect anything good or great. Overall, it's okay at best, hampered by lousy elements that are stunningly amateurish (for one, glaring kinks needed worked out in the script).

It's definitely the runt of the litter, but is by no means a disaster. It's intriguing that they had originally wanted Joseph Sargent to direct with Peter Falk starring, and that Meryl Streep was considered for the role that eventually went to Jessica Lange. The changes they made to update Kong for the seventies were intriguing (as they wanted the script to be completely different from the Cooper/Schoedsack masterpiece), and I'm left curious, had Sir Peter Jackson chosen to make Kong a 21st-century schizoid apeman instead of doing a period piece, how that would have transpired. Even being Canadian, seeing the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center made me wistfully nostalgic. The only part of the film that was excruciating to watch was when Kong is made to perform for the American Bicentennial festivities, and at the ending, I was curious how Lange got down from the rooftop of one of the towers so fast.

Having been introduced by my film loving parents to the original King Kong from 1933, as soon as this update - in colour - was released, I stood in that queue for two hours to see it. I was spellbound, absolutely loved it, telling everyone in school or on the playing fields how great an experience it was. Those things never leave you, it's love of cinema with youthful eyes, and none of us should ever decry those moments as being ignorance.

Much later in life, watching this reworking of the Kong story becomes a battle to not extinguish those youthful fires. For now you can see just how poor the effects are, in fact just how much of a cheat (through research) that uber producer Dino De Laurentiis was as he put this onto the screen. Conversely, though, you can now see just how adult much of it was. The pic is full of sexual connotations and imagery. I mean look at Jessica Lange's first scene, she is introduced in a wet dress with erectus nippleus in full effect. I didn't remember that as a 10 year old boy...

There's some smart era concerns in the narrative, fuels, discrimination etc, and for sure the array of characters on show are 1970s intelligent.

The damsel, meantime, is beginning to fall for her over-sized beau and maybe she didn't actually want rescuing? We, on the other hand, certainly do. This takes far too long to get going and once it does, it offers us a very pedestrian interpretation of one of the most iconic love stories in cinema history with acting that is as about as wooden as it gets. The colour photography is first rate, but that also serves to rob the film of much of it's soul. This has a made-for-television look to it that is entirely devoid of any sense of menace or emotion. Lange screams like the best of them at the beginning, but there is nothing of the vulnerable about her characterisation. It doesn't help that the supporting cast are little better than a collection of daytime C-listers delivering a dialogue that really needed quite a bit more work had it hoped to engage us for 2¼ hours.

And... he's shooting at a distance with a fixed 50, that's one of those Hollywood photography things that irritates the heck out of me, but you can't see the auto advance attachment as well without a telephoto can you Hollywood?

You would think that people who work with cameras would take it more seriously in the movie.

Anyway, it's not a bad movie. The acting is fine, the plot is fine, the Fx are dated but era fine as well.... and it's entertaining....

... but it's grainy. Maybe it can be cleaned up in remastering, but they didn't use enough lighting and opted for film a little too fast for quality. And for someone like me, that's irritating as heck too.

Photography paid my way though grad school, of I can do better, they can do better.

It just isn't as monumental as the 33 film, and that it a high bar that makes it look bad in comparison.

But at the end of the day it's still fun and that's what matters.",10.0
10733,"Welcome to the murky middle ground where legend and history meet. I enjoyed this movie as an earnest attempt to tell this iconic legend in a slightly different way. Its variance from the legend may make cinema purists uncomfortable, but I have read a lot about the Alamo over the past 40 years and don't feel threatened by it. History, after all, is written by the winners. I think the last scene with Davy Crockett is based on a book by a Mexican soldier, but I am not 100% sure. Some historians suggest the battle was begun while everyone slept and was over in minutes. The first best selling biography of David Crockett (his descendants say he never went by Davy, that that was a Walt Disney concept) may have made up some of the legend now accepted as nearly factual.

I like the line Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett gives about the burden of being Crockett, the legendary Crockett, that is, rather than the private Crockett he is not allowed to be. It is just as well that the battle turned out to be such a rallying cry for Sam Houston's army, because it doesn't feel like it accomplished much else. Well, except for providing material for an entertaining movie, that is.",8.0
10733,"Didn't enjoy this.

<em>'The Alamo'</em>, to me at least, is an incredibly slow-paced and rather boring 137 minutes. Not even the free-for-all action sequences bring any true entertainment, due to the chaotic filming nature of them; I get there's supposed to be pandemonium, but the camera work is a mess.

Another negative to note is the score, which is one of the poorest I've heard. It's so soppy and full of itself at times it makes it almost unwatchable, though in fairness isn't helped by the direction. I get they were attempting to show the lives of the people involved, but two-second dialogues and dramatic music doesn't attach you to characters.

The cast don't do anything majorly wrong, but I couldn't find a connection with any of them. Billy Bob Thornton is probably the best in this, as he portrays Davy Crockett. Dennis Quaid doesn't get enough to work with as Sam Houston, while none of the others standout - not even Emilio Echevarría as Santa Anna.

Patrick Wilson is Colonel Travis trying to command a garrison of Texan freedom fighters holed up in an old Catholic Mission against the overwhelming forces of Mexican General Santa Anna. His task is made the harder by the fact that he is a bit inept, and has some very strong characters to try to lead - not least Davy Crockett (Tommy Lee Jones) and Jim Bowie (Jason Patric). Unlike the earlier version, this story takes us beyond the well told story of the siege, and as such better completes the story of the birth of Texas as an independent state. Better, but as to the acting - well that is all pretty mediocre, sterile even. The dialogue is wordy and lacking in much humour and these undoubted characters are underplayed by all concerned.

I love a good prison escape flick, shown by my love for those two aforementioned productions which do improve on the formula; TSR - one of my favourite films, fwiw - particularly must've took a lot of inspiration from this, I noted a fair few similarities.

With the cast, you have an excellent performance from Clint Eastwood. Patrick McGoohan fits his role nicely, while Paul Benjamin and Larry Hankin are the best of the rest. I would've liked more development for the characters of Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau, who felt a little tacked on. Elsewhere, Danny Glover makes his acting debut in a tiny, tiny role.

I found the pacing to be very good, sure the story I guess is obvious in terms of its direction but I still got tense and edgy whilst watching the escape take place. The ambience of the film is a positive too, with the exception of one moment early on where there's an overly on the nose lightning strike as one of the characters mentions Alcatraz - nothing major, it's a nit-pick and it's my only one so that's a big plus.

He is bank robber Frank Morris, Incarcerated in one of America's most impregnable prisons, under the menacing gaze of warden Patrick McGoohan. He quickly concludes that he has little left to live for but escape. Together with twins Clarence and John Anglin (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau) he puts together an intricate plan to escape their prison by using the utility tunnels to escape the complex then some makeshift inflatables to get across San Francisco bay. The facts of the story mean the ending is never in doubt - insofar as we actually know what the ending was/is! Now that rather detracts from any sense of jeopardy with the screenplay, but is one of the aspects that make Eastwood all the more compelling - his meticulous planning, ingenuity and sheer perspicacity is enthralling - ok, at times a little slow - to watch. He has to deal with the odd internal fracas, most notably from ""Wolf"" (Bruce Fisher) who would have some fun with him, if you get my drift... but none of that detracts him from his goal. Aside from this mission, Don Siegel offers us quite a detailed glimpse into life behind bars towards the end of this crumbling building's life; and we are exposed to the relentless tedium and despair of many which engenders some sympathy - however evil they may have been to be sent there in the first place. What Siegel doesn't really do, though, is use McGoohan to much effect. His usual less-is-more style of performance is certainly here, but all to infrequently to really build an sense of menace.

10739,"_**What it's like to have a nutty, morally loose girlfriend in New York City**_

Jerry (Jason Briggs) is a fledgling writer in the Big Apple with an inept agent (Danny DeVito). As Jerry starts a relationship with a loose girl (Christina Ricci) he gets counsel from an older writer with a great vocabulary named Dobel (Woody Allen), usually while walking Central Park. Stockard Channing plays the girl's irritating mother and a young Jimmy Fallon has a cameo.

Written & directed by Woody Allen, ""Anything Else"" (2003) is a dialogue-driven romantic comedy that reflects on the mysteries, absurdities and ironies of life while focusing on the attraction and power of a nubile woman. Briggs is a quality protagonist and I enjoyed Jerry and Dobel's mentee/mentor relationship. Dobel uses a lot of obscure terminology so I recommend using the subtitles to keep up with it, as well as the low-key humor, which is quite entertaining. It's also nice to see Erica Leerhsen in a small role.

Christina looks great and is a fit as can be, but her morally loose character is a mass of conflicting impulses. Her actions are controlled by whether or not she's excited by her sexual partner and, of course, only a new partner excites her, which means no sexual relations with a man once he becomes ""old hat."" While she's looking to find excitement elsewhere Jerry does everything he can to keep the relationship going, which is hard to do when the girl's obnoxious mother is living in the same apartment. 

Not only is it frustrating for Jerry to deal with this situation, it's frustrating for the viewer as well. No doubt these types of aggravating people and relationships are the point of the movie, and it IS amusing to a point, but it naturally makes the viewing experience aggravating as well. Plus sympathy for Jerry only goes so far; after all, he's the fool who dropped his perfectly suitable mate (KaDee Strickland) to pursue the sexy-but-unfaithful new girl. In short, he's sleeping in the bad he made.

Nevertheless, the movie’s witty, thought-provoking, well made and performed. It’s one of Tarantino’s 20 favorite flicks from 1992-2009.

I remember when it was released in 2004, there was a big hurrah about ""the"" bath scene, many vitriolic complaints about how slow it was, how not scary it was et al. Birth is many wonderful film making things, of course not all of those things will resonate or enthral many of the movie watching populace, yet there is such craft on both sides of the camera here, and an atmospherically ambiguous bloodline pulsing throughout, that marks it out as a particularly striking film.

Plot finds Nicole Kidman as Anna, who is about to be re-married but finds her world tipped upside down when a young boy (Cameron Bright) arrives on the scene and announces he is the reincarnation of her dead first husband...

Director Jonathan Glazer and his co-writers Jean-Claude Carrière & Milo Addica are purposely being vague, I mean lets face it, the topic to hand is exactly that, vague, and ripe for countless hours of discussion. The film simmers along deftly, meditations on love, grief and anger are skilfully portrayed by all involved. Even a birthing tunnel metaphor doesn't come off as self indulgent, from the off Glazer wants and gets those interested in the story to buy into the hypnotic qualities on show. To jump on board with Anna's fragility while all around her battle for rhyme or reason with her mindset.

In truth it's a hard sell as a piece of entertainment, there's still today, over a decade since it was released, people miffed that the hinted at supernatural elements are not key to the narrative. While the thin line of good and bad taste - and maybe even pretentiousness - is being tested by the makers, but the charges of Birth being dull are just wrong. It never shows its hand, the mystery always remains strong, while Kidman and Lauren Bacall are reason enough to admire the acting craft on show.

There are also a couple of soapy sub-plots asking who's having an affair with whom and the whole thing is interspersed with some actuality of the night's real-time political events as if to give it some weight. Sadly, though, despite it's pretty stellar cast the whole thing just doesn't knit in anything like an interesting enough fashion. It's as if Emilio Estevez determined to get as many of his friends and family (and their friends and family) to take part in a Democrat fundraising movie peppered with some rousing dogma from the archives. It's over-scripted, pace-less and there are way too many distractions to make this anything compelling to watch.

The Outlaw Josey Wales is directed by Clint Eastwood, who also stars as Wales, and is adapted by Sonia Chernus & Phil Kaufman from the novel ""The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales"" written by Forrest Carter. Joining Eastwood in the cast are Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney, John Vernon & Paula Trueman. Music is by Jerry Fielding and Bruce Surtees photographs on location in Utah, Arizona & Wyoming.

We are at the very end of the American Civil War and Josey Wales is a contented family man working on his Missouri farm. But his peaceful world is shattered when Union soldiers raid his home and murder his wife and child. Surviving the attack, Josey takes up arms with a group of Confederate guerrilla fighters who take the fight to the Redlegs. However, when the news comes that the war is over and the Confederates are required to surrender, Josey refuses to do so. A wise choice since his group are rounded up and slaughtered in cold blood. So Josey is forced to go on the lam as an outlaw, where hot on his trail are the Redleg group fronted by bloodthirsty Captain Terrill. On his way, as he contemplates survival and what life has in store for he and his aggressors, Josey acquires some interesting companions.

Acclaimed by the critics upon its release, The Outlaw Josey Wales is ageing like a fine wine. It's a film Eastwood himself is very proud of, citing it as one of the high points in his career. Yet the film got off to a difficult start. It was originally given to Kaufman to direct with Eastwood's Malpaso company producing, but the star and director fell out over Kaufman's directing style - and that a certain Sondra Locke was turning the heads of both men. As we now know, there was only one winner there.

The story is a classic Western tale, hell it's a powerful tale, one with layers that peel off as the film progresses. Josey Wales starts out a peaceful family man but after having that stripped away from him by violence, he too is forced to take up violence in response. So far so formulaic then. But the film is so much more than just a Western revenge yarn, even if that aspect of the story is darn good as Clint gets mean and broody and pulls his pistols. There's a real strong family thread throughout, from losing his own kin in the beginning - to a father son relationship - and on to the way he acquires a new family on his travels, it's very strong and gives the narrative a real emotional kick. As Josey goes on his way, angry, bitter and prepared to face the consequence of his choices, the character is constantly forming. It was only after a number of viewings that I personally realised that Josey Wales the man was being healed by the ragtag assortment of individuals that he collects on route to his character being rebuilt.

Eastwood the actor here is on fine form, cool and every inch a man's man. But even Eastwood wouldn't decry the scene stealing excellence of Chief Dan George as Lone Watie. His dry wit puts him in the top tier of Western comedy sidekicks, but rest assured the character is more than that. For Watie acts as a sort of spiritual mentor to Wales, and Eastwood reacts positively to George's serene acting to give the film its tight bonded centre. The rest of the cast are a much of a muchness but all serve the story well with solid performances. In fact it's a rare occasion when Locke's vacant method acting actually works well! Eastwood the director is calm, assured and subtle in pacing, with his storytelling boosted considerably by Fielding's popping score and Surtees' gorgeous cinematography. The script is awash with attentive dialogue and punching moments of humour, whilst its noticeable denouncement of violence and intelligent portrayals of the Indians is to be roundly applauded.

Iconography unbound and bulging with class in the writing, The Outlaw Josey Wales is not just one of Eastwoods best Westerns. It's one of the best Westerns period. I reckon so. 10/10",10.0

The Civil War is over and the remaining rebels in Missouri are encouraged to turn over their weapons and pledge loyalty to the Union, but Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood) hold out and thus a generous reward is put on his head. Josey heads to West Texas and maybe Mexico to find sanctuary, but will he make it alive? The cast includes the likes of Bill McKinney, John Vernon, Sondra Locke, Chief Dan George, Sam Bottoms and Will Sampson.  

“The Outlaw Josey Wales” (1976) is Eastwood’s best Western and a standout of the genre. Everything clicks for a top-of-the-line drama/adventure. A critic said that Wales’ encounter with the Federals in the first act establishes him as invincible and thus destroys any sense of suspense. No, it just means that he caught the soldiers by surprise and he escaped the clash unscathed with a mixture of skill and luck. A later scene reveals he’s decidedly mortal. 
 
The movie starts with the typical Bob Steele revenge plot and soon morphs into a trail movie (similar to a “road movie,” but with horses). As such, some interesting characters come-and-go (or, more accurately, come-and-die), but several stay on. It’s a string of memorable episodes on the long trail, like the river crossing and Josey’s well-done pow-wow with Ten Bears (Will Sampson). I like the emphasis on how an outcast can acquire an unconventional family, even if inadvertently.

When it was announced that there was to be a modern reboot of St. Trinian’s, it was met with luke warm murmurings to say the least. Yet when it comes down to it, the old films from the 50s and 60s were hardly comedy gold anyway. Safe family fare and sometimes fun into the bargain, and with strong casts, they have never been seen as essential British comedies and untouchable by the modern era’s obsession with remakes and reimaging.

St. Trinian’s 2007 style is not an improvement on the oldies, but neither is it the stinker some critics in 2007 wanted us to believe. It has enough about it to be its own animal, it’s funny, sexy and never dull. This also benefits from strong comic casting, where the likes of Rupert Everett (having the time of his life in drag), Colin Firth and Russell Brand are pitched into the femme madness headed by Gemma Arterton and Tallulah Riley. The writers err on the side of caution as far as risqué material goes, but there’s some very strong gags played out and the grouping of the girls into the various cliques (Emos, Chavs etc) is a nifty bit of writing that is mined to good effect.

You may not agree with its points, and they may be elusive, but it's not pointless.

While I like the film and it contains scores of beautiful women, I'm only giving it a marginal ""thumbs up"" because they could've done better on this front considering the wealth of resources they had to work with, not to mention the opening credits sequence is noticeably overlong and dull. Interestingly, the ending graphically details the birth of a baby, a male.

The film runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in the Dallas area.

It's upsetting for Bond fans that Eon productions ran away from the lively, fun formula that sustained the franchise for 40 years. What does it leave us with? Well - this type of Bond film unfortunately. Staggeringly bland and uninteresting.  If we removed the name Bond from the film we would have no idea that we were watching a Bond movie. 

It is depressing that they flushed 40 years of fun Bond films down the toilet to satiate people who dislike classic Bond adventures. They reached for a wider audience by going all generic action film to the detriment of the Bond legacy.

Who is this unsophisticated, short, blond man in the suit? Unfortunately, _he could be anyone_ - even you or I. Bond is now a lager chugging everyman. Ian Fleming would be furious.

No chance of Craig's Bond wearing  _a strap on plastic seagull hat_ as Connery did in the classic Goldfinger (1964) - they would not dare make the films that fun and entertaining anymore.

It's a shame what they did to the Bond films.",1.0

Quantum of Solace is directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neil Purvis and Robert Wade, suggested from the stories written by Ian Fleming. It stars Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Judi Dench, Giancarlo Giannini, Gemma Arteton & Jeffrey Wright. It is the 22nd film of the James Bond series.

Following on straight from Casino Royale, we find James Bond thirsting for revenge on those he believes responsible for Vesper Lynd's death.

Is Quantum Of Solace a great action film? Yes it surely is, is it however a great James Bond picture? Not quite, apparently, given the often venomous reaction to it from some Bond fan quarters. You wonder if Quantum Of Solace is a victim of Casino Royale's soaring success? A film that even surprised the many Daniel Craig haters. Were these internet warriors preying for a bad Bond film purely to further their argument that Craig should not be Bond? Did QOS give them smug satisfaction? Actually no it didn't, the box office and longevity of professional critiques proves this fact. Further viewings of QOS show it to be very astute in the Bond universe, where much of the charges of it not being fun enough etc just do not stick. As for not being Bondian enough? Opening car chase, a pursuit on foot that ends in a quite exhilarating rope dangle punch up, speedboat chaos, aeroplane peril with free-falling! Not Bond enough? Seriously? While it's also great to see Bond active on a motorcycle again.

The Casino Royale rebooted and re-suited offering was popular because it had an earthy make over, Daniel Craig's Bond is a fallible human being brimming with egotistical ruggedness. It's much of the same here in Quantum, where he is forced to go rouge, something that again has proved to be an itchy narrative thrust with sections of the Bond faithful. Yet as serious as he is, driven by pangs of annoyance, revenge and unanswered questions, Bond does have time to lay out a quip, there is some fun stuff their, honestly, Mother. Personally I enjoy the dark half of this Bond, ""I don't have any friends"", he wouldn't care"", and ""how many is that now?"", these are moments nearly as good as the interwoven opera blood bath and Bond drinking away his demons with 6 high velocity cocktails. Then there is Craig. Ah, Craig, Daniel Craig, again perfect in the tux and kicking arse with streetwise credibility, each scar on his nicely formed body a testament to this new rugged Bond of the people. That he rises above a relatively muddling script is testament to not only his acting ability, but also his new found acceptance in this most iconic of cinematic roles amongst the British institution that is James Bond.

The rest of the cast are a mixed bunch, Jeffrey Wright & Giancarlo Giannini are again merely making up the numbers, though the last gets to give Bond one of the film's darkest and cold inducing moments. Judi Dench of course does her usual solid M performance, swearing and growing the balls she hinted at previously, while Olga Kurylenko is very much a sparky Bond girl to savour; even if the sub-plot involving her almost feels like it was shoe-horned into the script as an added extra. Elsewhere there are problems. Casino Royale, had on the surface a weak villain, a man merely playing cards to pay off a more evil source, but he was effective. Sadly here in the Quantam universe the main villain is a hindrance to the picture. Mathieu Amalric's Dominic Greene does a good line in smarmy, but he's so weak the film nearly crumbles under the weight of his banality. The people at the house of Bond need to realise that little fish villains are only OK if we get the big daddy shark showing his/her face later in proceedings, for if this trend continues I fear the franchise could well lose the edge so well built up in Royale, and Gemma Arteton is pretty, but pretty ineffective. The locations are sumptuous, mind, and the sets are Bondian delights, with the title sequence certainly hitting the spot in spite of the quite dreadful Jack Black and Alcia Keys' theme song that accompanies the sequence. A homage to a former great Bond film sequence is respectful but a touch lazy, but QOS still overcomes its failings to be up above many action pictures of the last decade; this in spite of it being very slim line at an hour and 45 in length. Crucially, though, it pulses with Bond aggression and egotistical nous, just as Fleming wanted it. But this only comes out with further viewings...

Skyfall will be the next venture for Bond, regardless of quality we know that it will fail to appease every Bond fan on the planet. That's just the way it is with the series, so many want so many different things from their Bond. But I feel this is a good period for Bond, they do have the right man wearing the tux and as a character he is well tuned into the times, both politically and cinematically, it's now up to the makers to fuse the two and deliver a film to fully realise the rebooted franchise's potential and maybe, just maybe, win the dissenters' trust. 7/10",7.0
10764,"Quantum of Solace had to follow Casino Royale which rebooted the Bond franchise with critics as well as with some of the public with a youthful, angry Bond.

Quantum of Solace starts 20 minutes after the events of Casino Royale with a fast edited but choppy car chase sequence. This is the first hint that Bond is following the Bourne films as co-editor Richard Pearson previously edited one of the Bourne films. This also highlights director's Marc Forster inexperience in making action films as many of the action sequences are hard to follow because of the way it has been edited.

The film was also hampered by the 2008 writer's strike. This meant that film went into production without a full working script which also meant that the director and even Daniel Craig allegedly wrote scenes for the film. It might explain the short running time.

The film unveils Quantum as a shady organisation with tentacles everywhere even in the heart of the British security services. The setting in Bolivia with disputes about water gives the film a political edge with a cynical look at corporations making dicey alliances with dictatorships to mutually exploit the people and plunder resources.

Forster gives the film some intriguing set pieces such the opera scene which is the meeting point for Quantum operatives which Bond infiltrates.

The plot isn't the best nor is the villain, albeit Mathieu Amalric does have the creep-factor going for him. The action sequences are good but not enough quieter moments.

Plus, the (kind of) twist at the end regarding Vesper really cheapened that character, having her being duped like that, seems out of character given how perceptive she was with Bond.

In any case, still a solid enough movie as a whole and I absolutely love Olga Kuryenko, shame she never really took off. **3.25/5**",7.0
10764,"_**Decent Bond flick marred by ridiculous quick-editing**_

Bond seeks justice for the death of his woman in the previous film as well as those responsible for an assassination attempt on M (Judi Dench). The trail leads from mountainous northern Italy to the rooftops of Siena, Italy, to London to Haiti and finally to the secluded desert of Bolivia and Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a world-renowned developer of green technology. Greene is intent on securing a barren area of Bolivia in exchange for assisting General Medrano stage a coup there (Joaquín Cosio). Since the CIA looks the other way, only 007 stands in Greene's way with assistance from a retired spy and two formidable beauties (Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton). M wonders if she can trust Bond or if his need for vengeance has corrupted him.

Released in 2008, ""Quantum of Solace"" is the second of five Bond films with Daniel Craig as Agent 007. Craig makes for a unique James Bond and I appreciate the serious vibe of his installments.

The problem with ""Quantum of Solace,"" the 23nd Bond film (if you count 1983's non-Eon ""Never Say Never Again""), is the rapid-fire editing during the action scenes. Take, for instance, the opening chase-sequence that takes place on the tollway that leads through mountain tunnels from Nice through Monte Carlo and down to Portofino in Italy. It's a spectacularly scenic area. Unfortunately you won't see much of it here, just quick flashes; more importantly, you'll hardly understand what's going on due to the moronic fast editing. The camera switches about 3 or 4 times per second! I'm sure the filmmakers think such quick angle changes convey energy, but when it's done this fast all it does is confuse, disorient and ANNOY the viewer. It wouldn't be so bad if this was the only sequence like this but, no, after Bond's initial meeting with M (Judi Dench) there's another ridiculous rapid-fire action scene.

The filmmakers need to get a grip that James Bond is not a mindless action hero. He's too smart for that; he's the ultimate 'cool' attitude. Violence for him is an irritation resorted to only when necessary. He exists for the mental play, the checkmate and, later, the martini, shaken, not stirred; the beautiful woman too, of course. The only way the average viewer can successfully make it past the 25-minute mark of ""Quantum of Solace"" and enjoy the movie is if s/he drinks a pot of heavily-caffeinated coffee beforehand. If you do this it's an entertaining Bond picture with some effective sequences, like when Bond and Camille find themselves stuck in the remote desert after surviving a thrilling aerial combat, plus Olga (Camille) and Gemma (Strawberry Fields) are top-of-the-line, but the annoying quick-editing in the action scenes heavily mars the flick and prevents it from being in the top tier of the franchise.

The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in England, Italy, Austria, Spain, Panama (standing in for Haiti), Chili (the Atacama Desert) and Baja California (the last two standing in for Bolivia).

""Quantum of Solace is one of the biggest disappointments of the respective decade, holding a titanic drop in quality compared to its predecessor. Daniel Craig's dedicated performance isn't enough to save an over-violent James Bond flick, packed with terribly handled action sequences - shaky cam and quick cuts may be the worst technical combo in cinema - and an uninspiring, utterly boring narrative. Both the villain and the new Bond girls return to being easily forgettable cliches.

Rating: D",3.0
10764,"Whilst there is certainly loads of action in this rather procedural outing for ""James Bond"" (a rather uncharismatic Daniel Craig) there is a real dearth of a substantial story. Picking up from ""Casino Royale"" (2006), this film sees our super-spy capture elusive ""Mr White"" (Jesper Christiansen) only to have him escape in the most treacherous of fashions - putting all in MI6 at risk. Pretty quickly, ""007"" is on the trail of the ostensibly benign millionaire ""Greene"" (Mathieu Amalric) and as the escapades gather pace we realise that the industrialist has a cunning plan to manipulate a crime consortium of global proportions; to take over the government of Bolivia and to control the ebb and flow of one of that nation's most crucial resources. Thing is, though, that this is all just too weak. The story is just lacklustre and undercooked. The efforts of the baddies - Amalric, Anatole Taubman as henchman ""Elvis"" and a straight-from-central-casting Joaquín Cosio as the scheming ""Gen. Medrano"" just to don't create any sense of menace or peril. Far too much time is spent swinging from scaffolding, or trashing a rather impressive set for a performance of ""Tosca"" rather than creating a solid story with twists and turns. Again, the character of ""M"" (Dame Judi Dench) has much more of a role, and sacrilegious as it may be, she just isn't very good at it. She seemed to be wearing the same clothes for most of her scenes, too! The dialogue is rather dry, no fun innuendo or double-entendre and though quite spunky, Olga Kurylenko is no natural as ""Camille"", a girl with an axe to grind (ideally into the general's skull). It ends a bit like ""Licence to Kill"" (1989) and, indeed, is all just a bit too much of an hybrid of the other films to offer much by way of distinction. Good to see an Aston Martin back on screen, but otherwise this rather curiously titled film offers very little to write home about.",6.0

Many find Quantum of Solace a disappointing entry in the Daniel Craig Bond era, but I beg to differ. When viewed as a stand-alone film, I can understand frustrations with a meager storyline. But when considered the conclusion of Casino Royale, this movie becomes much better. Casino Royale ends with Bond suffering a significant loss, and Quantum allows him to take revenge. Bond is still grappling with a broken heart and is less interested in the standard Bond romantic escapades than usual. In fact, the main Bond girl of the movie is more of a partner in the film than a romantic prospect. The opening fight sequence, the action, the stunts, and the locations are some of the franchise's best.

I have a special place in my heart for the religious thriller, so perhaps I'm a tad more lenient than I should be in my grading, but I could very well say that the devil made me do it, or at the very least, his spawn. Jerry Goldsmith does another fine soundtrack, albeit not with the two Oscar nominations and one win this time around, while William Holden and Lee Grant do a credible job of replacing stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, whom Damien had no qualms dispensing with in the first film.

I think the problem with this follow up is that having already been exposed to the style of horror this offers: the sharp violin music, tight facial close ups, and the use of an animal (in this case it is a crow) as his implement of choice, there is very little by way of a shock factor.

The Final Conflict is directed by Graham Baker and written by David Seltzer and Andrew Birkin. It stars Sam Neill, Rossano Brazzi, Don Gordon, Lisa Harrow, Barnaby Holm and Mason Adams. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Phil Meheux and Robert Paynter.

The third and final part of ""The Omen Trilogy"" sees adult Antichrist Damien Thorn (Neill) now as a massive mover in industry and about to shift towards politics. As he surges towards the top, with a biblical prophecy about to come true, the second coming of Christ and a religious order look to be the only hope for mankind. 

Although it's undeniably the weakest of the trilogy, this does however close things down without utter embarrassment. Bringing to attention Sam Neill as an actor to note, where he is splendidly sinister, we are however burdened with a too long running for what is a surprisingly bloodless affair.

The dark shades in the narrative are strong enough to keep us hooked in (yikes, infanticide), but there's too many unanswered questions and ignorance of continuity requirements from the previous two films. While it ends on a hopelessly twee religious Christmas card crescendo.

Ultimately it's more a case of being one for fans of the series only, where the story reaches the conclusion for those who began the journey back in 1976. For casual observers, though, the lethargic nature of this particular beast is likely to bore and grate. 6/10",6.0

Django is directed by Sergio Corbucci and it stars Franco Nero, José Bódalo, Loredana Nusciak, Ángel Álvarez and Eduardo Fajardo. 

Django (Nero), dragging a coffin behind him, saves a woman from some bandits and soon finds himself in the middle of war between two factions - which he may be able to use to his advantage. 

1966 was a stellar year for Spaghetti Westerns, Leone was putting the crown on his ""Dollars"" trilogy, Damiani produced a political firecracker and Sollima crafted one of the finest ""manhunt"" Oaters of this sub-genre. Then there is this, Django, a Pasta Western that is synonymous with the form. 

I fought for the North! 

Django is a treat, it's violent and cruel, funny and cheeky, and pleasing on the eyes and ears - so pretty much it contains all the best things that made the original wave of Spaghetti's so palatable. Undeniably it owes a ""lot"" to A Fistful of Dollars and Yojimbo, but it's still its own beast, a baroque Gothic piece of work that positively revels in nihilism. The graphic violence is wonderfully cartoonish, the iconography unbound, and in Nero - eyes likes chips of ice - the pic has one of the coolest and baddest men on the planet. Nusciak brings the sex and sizzle, coming off like a Spag Raquel Welch, whilst the villains are delightfully vile and scuzzy. 

The setting is superb, a muddy cold hell of a town with a brothel as the fulcrum of the piece. Naturally there's a cemetery, which will play host to some of that iconography mentioned earlier. Religion gets short shrift, racial prejudice given a caustic once over, while it's worth mentioning there's more than a hint of social realism pulsing away as Corbucci brings the blood and thunder. OK! It's light in plotting, and it's not even Corbucci's best film, but the stylised violence, the visuals and a cracking soundtrack easily take you away from the fodder of the story. 

It would spawn a multitude of rip-offs, name checks and influence a whole host of film makers, but this is the real deal. A Spag Western worth revisiting to see just when it was a sub-genre of quality, this before hundreds of poor band wagon jumpers began to soil the Spaghetti Western name. 8.5/10",8.5
10772,"***Cult Spaghetti Western with Django dragging his coffin***

A mysterious stranger dragging a coffin (Franco Nero) saves a prostitute named Maria (Loredana Nusciak) and waltzes into a neutral border town that services both a private militia of ex-Rebels led by Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo) and a small army of Mexican revolutionaries, led by General Hugo (José Bódalo). Meanwhile there’s gold to be had.

Released in 1966, “Django” (pronounced JANG-oh) is a cult Euro Western highlighted by its star and the typical cartoonish flourishes of the genre. Franco Nero and his Spaghetti Western lookalike, Terence Hill, represented the Euro-version of Clint Eastwood. To be expected, the characters are cardboard caricatures and there’s a lot of brutal violence that’s so sadistic and overdone it’s comical.

For instance, 15 men are dead by the 20 minute mark with 40 more shortly later in a machine gun bloodbath. A mere half hour later there’s a second machine gun assault lacking any artistic finesse whatsoever. It has to be seen to be believed and bespeaks of moviemaking for 13 year-olds. 

Considering what’s in Django’s coffin, the way he drags it around isn’t practical for more than 100 yards. The manner he awkwardly slogs it about is especially incredulous during the gold theft sequence where, curiously, no one sees or hears him. _Why Sure!_        

When do these events take place? The death date on Mercedes Zaro’s tombstone says 1889, which is substantiated by the use of the standard lever-action rifles and Django’s quasi-Maxim machine gun, pointing to no earlier than 1884.

Tarantino took elements of “Django” and other Spag Westerns to forge the outstanding “Django Unchained” (2012), which makes “Django” & most Euro Westerns of the 60s and early 70s pale by comparison. The title song by Luis Bacalov is good though and Nusciak is striking in an icy way.

GRADE: C",5.0
10772,"“Django, have you always been alone?” The song, written by Luis Bacalov and performed by Rocky Roberts, ponders, as an unknown man drags a coffin through the mud. That man is Django, a gunslinger who would go on to define a genre, and the protagonist of a gritty, violent and outrageously fun film. A man to respect, that is for sure.
	
Directed by Sergio Corbucci, the same artist responsible for classics such as Navajo Joe (1966) and The Great Silence (1968), the film is one of the most influential Spaghetti Westerns ever. It tells the story of Django (Franco Nero), a tragic hero with a mysterious background, who arrives at a town in war. Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo) and his men try to exterminate the Mexicans, who, led by General Rodriguez (José Bódalo) are trying to set up their revolution. In between the two sides is Nathaniel (Ángel Álvarez), the owner of the bar, hotel and bordello, who has to serve both sides.
	
A career-launching - and defining - performance by Franco Nero is one of the elements that make this flick a success. His character is defined by a constant feel of melancholy, to which Nero brings gravitas: while never losing his cool, especially through his steely and confident stares, Django is clearly portrayed as a haunted man. The supporting cast goes a long way in cementing the heavy tone of the film, especially Loredana Nusciak, giving a gutsy performance as a prostitute who falls for the titular character.
	
A notable part of this film’s magic are the action sequences. While extremely brutal for their time, including a man’s ear getting quite graphically severed, they are the absolute definition of “campy”. Instead of ruining it, it only makes the experience more enjoyable. The violence essentially gets a more humorous vibe, serving even as a relief from all the graveness that is present everywhere else in the movie.
	
The soundtrack is remarkable: not only does it present an unforgettable theme song for the opening, but it also has a spectacular use of the leitmotif (a recurring musical phrase).
	
Django is, in every possible way, a classic and standard bearer of its genre. Even with campy violent sequences for the public’s enjoyment, the film still maintains a serious storyline, and has great dramatic performances - especially by the central actor. As an answer to the question asked in the song, after gaining a huge legion of fans, it’s safe to say Django will no longer be alone.",10.0

Best screenplay suggests best story, best plot, best characters and dialogue; best combination of drama, comedy, intrigue, emotional engagement, suspense, social and political relevance; one peppered with casual everydayisms, baited with humour and simmering with intelligence, threatening to release an experiential payload of euphoric proportions; a work that can transcend genre and demographics, build up simultaneously on various levels, plumbed by the weight of it's essential voice, sending out intuitive signals, rippling with perplexing channels and insightful glimpses that are symbolically blended into plain words on paper; all with a properly superb balance of sex, wit, desire, comfort, fear, anger and wisdom in an accelerated narrative leading us to a magnificent crescendo and--fade out--leaving us to wonder. Furthermore, great screenplays serve the motion-picture medium's incomparable ability to effortlessly jump time and space. _Casablanca_ is static and contained, framed and nailed to the wall: a pretty photograph. 

Despite the WGA's endorsement, there can only be one candidate good enough to qualify for the all-time best screenplay, and fittingly it goes to the all-time best screenplay writer. Paddy Chayefsy's _Network_ has dazzled us for four decades and counting. The scene where a mob of murderous bank-robbing terrorists who have their own reality TV show bicker over the wording of their contract alone demonstrates we are dealing with a higher grade of pertinent genius. The corporate cosmology of Arthur Jensen, a pivotal lesson in global economics, tops it off, leaving all Network's competitors in the dust, burying any climactic speech written before or since, Bogie's famous brush-off farewell included, thus slamming the lid down on anything _Casablanca_ can play. As for ill-fated romances, the doomed alliance between old-school journalism (Holden) seduced and corrupted into severing his ties with his compassionate spouse to hastily shack up with the opportunistic post-modern media wench (Dunaway) is fraught with more complications than anything _Casablanca_ can muster, and it's only one of the sub-plots.

Of course _Network_ is most famous for the ""I'm mad as hell"" rant, which swells from a nuanced and complex story arc demonstrating the rise and fall of an iconic media star. Hell-raising public mischief aside, Howard Beale's profound narrative leads off with a suicidally desperate, washed-up newsman who impulsively hits a nerve, rockets to stardom as a modern-day prophet, then is shaped and sensationalized as an overcooked parody by the media, stigmatized by maniacal Fox-news-like delusions that overtake him until he gets too big for his britches and needs a walloping corporate scolding, causing his starry streak to fizzle out, before getting gunned down by the greedy TV execs who made him, leaving hapless undiscriminating audiences to grasp for the next new thing.

_Network_ is inspired writing that doesn't require heart-throbbing movie stars to pull it off. It could have been directed by my illiterate grandmother, shot on VHS in a dingy church basement, performed by eager boy scouts and girl guides, and it would still be the greatest screenplay of all time, one not just for the spectacle of projecting on a giant screen, but for doubling as a giant mirror with just enough sugar-coated satire to swallow the shitty truth about ourselves. Though calling _Network _a satire is like calling Hamlet a murder mystery. Satire is either spineless and passive-aggressive, or specific and short-lived. Chayefsky's bombastic pronouncements become more exceptional and relevant each passing year.",10.0
10774,"Network broadcasts its televisional corruption through satirical poetry that beckons democratic madness. “I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it anymore”, screams Howard Beale from the confinement of his studio desk. Exerting his ornate insanity upon the entranced viewers who innocently stare at their cubic televisions, watching the news broadcast fuelled by media misrepresentation and propaganda. “Go to your nearest window and scream”, acting as the voice of the working class, benign to the American corporate fundamentals that masquerade the politics of democracy. In an age where leading actors can represent constituencies or states, and businessmen can be presidential candidates for a nation (and successfully winning...), Lumet’s timeless satire on conceptualised democracy is one that grows more appropriate with each passing decade.

A statement on the American financial system, where colossal stock markets rule the supposed freedom of the people. Broadcasting networks more focussed on combating against each other for monetary viewership, leading to exaggerated fabrications, rather than reporting the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Exploiting the frail mentality of humanity to feed the greed and lust of “humanoid” managers, capitalising on the naivety of man.

Network depicts the modern evolution of communicating false truths. As technology evolves, we grow more and more susceptible to the “truth” that is conveyed to us. We, much like sponges, absorb the information demonstrated through the porous pixels that we subject our eyes to. Televisions. And through hyperbolised satire, including planning an assassination attempt and coercing suicidal tendencies, Lumet offers a cutthroat insight into broadcasting institutions and the meticulous methods in which networks function. Motivated by stock shares and rating dominance. Pioneering the consumption of propagandist material. Lumet exploits the audacious power of televisions and its communicative abilities, turning an often comedic satire into a transcendental horror feature.

Powered by sterling performances all-round, including the elusively commanding Dunaway, the maddening lunacy of Finch and the smoothly suave Holden, the poetic dialogue immediately captures the attention of its audience. Concisely elaborate with a hint of existential analysis, an ornate lexicon that refrains viewers from tuning out. Lumet’s long sumptuous takes, allowing the performances to ironically hypnotise, further extend the reach of its material. Superlative direction that, whilst suddenly throws you into the immediate chaos of Beale’s mentality, eases the hectic pace with its scathing power.

The offscreen affair between Dunaway and Holden was the only underdeveloped sub-plot, reinforcing her workaholic agenda that likened her to a corporate machine than to a human with emotive capabilities.

Aside from that, Network absolutely deserves its near-perfect acclaim. A considerably profound illustration of the American system that tantalisingly exposes the fraudulence of promised conceptualised democracy, whilst also enforcing the relinquishment of humanity through television sets. Harrowing times we live in...",9.0
10774,"The UPS network is a television network that suffers from a lack of viewership. This led to the layoff of a group of their employees, including the great media night news presenter, Howard Beale, and this led to the events of a psychological impact on Beale, so he promised that he would commit suicide in front of the camera the next day.

The conditions and conditions of the network changed after Beale's decision to commit suicide in front of the camera the next day. The film takes us through the changes that occur to the network after this incident. How did Howard get the situation to the brink, how does the network deal with the crisis, and how do they benefit from the incident, or in a more correct, how do they exploit it to increase the number of views and return the network to the most powerful television network in America.

The film focuses on 4 characters, the first character is Diana Christensen, a character who doesn't care about high principles in the media and tries in various ways to do anything, even if it is bad, in order to make the network gain more views, a character that surprises you a lot because of her orientations. The second character is Howard Beale and the internal factors that led him to stand in front of the camera, fragile and mind-bending. Is it personal or is the network related?

The third character, who are the members of the network and the fate of the company, what are the things they will do in order to save the network from collapse and raise viewing rates and ratings, even if at the expense of harming others, literally anything?

The last character is the viewers. How do they want to attract viewers to the network as long as possible to ensure higher profits and the viewer to stay for as long as possible? This requires many things that you will see in the movie.

What I liked about the film is that the film was able to mock companies, criticize societies, and focus on the weakness of people through its story and not through direct messages. The highest number of views.

What we see now in the media in the 21st century, we see that this is true, although the film says that it is based on fictional events. How do the minds of the media founders play with the minds of the viewers through the television screens that reach every home? It was formulated well. Are people only looking for entertainment, even if it is at the expense of harming others? All these ideas and questions are employed in a coherent story and seen through its complex characters.",8.0
10774,"Peter Finch is superb here as the increasingly puritanical television news anchor (""Beale"") who, having been told he was about to be fired decided on air to tell the audience he was going to shoot himself on live telly. Next night - yep, he was allowed back - he declared that it was time the viewing public got off their sofas and declared they had ""had enough"" with lazy government and corporate greed. His long suffering boss ""Max"" (William Holden) wants to have him looked after (medically) but the ambitious PR executive ""Diana"" (Faye Dunaway) sees an opportunity amidst all this evangelicalism and convinces the station's new boss ""Hackett"" (Robert Duvall) to remove ""Max"" and to reinstate ""Beale"" with his own hour long news hour programme complete with it's own soothsayer! Initially, this all sounds too barmy to be real, but in true television tradition - it catches on. The audiences soar, the advertisers and sponsors love it. For once, the news division isn't haemorrhaging cash! Can this be sustained though? ""Beale"" is entirely out of control and nobody - even his own network - is safe from his ranting and raving. Sooner or later he is bound to overstep the mark - and then the dominoes are going to topple spectacularly. To be honest I found the story to become more and more preposterous as the potent points about avarice, venality and success at all costs became subsumed into a denouement scenario that was pretty ridiculous. That said, this isn't really about the story so much as the performances from Finch, Holden, and the frequently scene-stealing Dunaway who delivers some pithy monologues with the sharpness of hound's tooth! Even now, almost fifty years later, it still resonates as conversations about true journalism versus commercial pandering showing no sign of ever abating, let alone finding a solution that adequately satisfies both. It also swipes quite nicely at the audience - the anything for a peaceable life brigade who get their news from television so long as they like what they hear! I would have like to have seen more of Finch, but as it is, this is a cracking and characterful look at what makes some of us tick (or not!).",7.0
10774,"Few Hollywood productions have been as utterly prescient as director Sidney Lumet’s cinematic masterpiece “Network” (1976), a chillingly serious satire about the television business in the 1970s and where it was ultimately headed in years to come. Written by TV pioneer Paddy Chayefsky, this winner of four Oscars on 10 total nominations provides a comical but cynically disturbing look inside the workings of a fictitious American television network. In telling this story, the film eerily forecast the direction this medium would take in the decades that followed with remarkable accuracy, stunningly predicting such developments as the tabloidization of TV, the consolidation of media ownership, the impact of foreign influence and investment, and the dumbing down, sensationalism and line-blurring of its content in both its entertainment and journalistic programming. It also nailed developments outside the television business with great clarity by focusing on the pivotal role that TV played (and would come to play) in those occurrences. And, even though it’s something of a nostalgic time capsule of the period in which it was filmed, the picture has held up remarkably well (it gets better with every viewing for me), even unwittingly providing viewers with an ironic and unsettling metaphor for the ubiquitous rise of social media (with TV serving as a stunningly fitting stand-in). Chayefsky’s Academy Award-winning script is positively brilliant, epitomizing what good screenwriting can (and should) be. And its casting is about as good as it gets, earning Oscars for the performances of Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight, along with well-deserved nominations for William Holden and Ned Beatty and noteworthy accolades for Robert Duvall and Marlene Warfield. In fact, I’m stunned that this offering lost out to “Rocky” for best picture and that nominee Lumet was passed over for the best director award. Those oversights aside, however, I was nevertheless privileged to view this offering at a retrospective screening in honor of the filmmaker’s 100th birthday to a nearly sold-out audience. I’m pleased to see that this celluloid gem still garners so much viewer attention nearly 50 years after its release and that it’s attracting the interest of moviegoers of all ages. This is an absolute must-see for avid cinephiles, as well as highly recommended viewing for anyone who truly wants a poignant, insightful look at what’s truly going on in the world around them, particularly when it comes to the workings of said world and the selective filtering of information about it. “Network” just might deservedly open a few eyes – and raise quite a few eyebrows at the same time.",10.0

10779,"When a man's jawbone drops off it's time to reassess the situation.

Peter Jackson's The Frighteners is an odd blend of outright comedy and supernatural thriller, if able to get onside with that then there's a whole lot to enjoy. Plot essential has Michael J. Fox as a psychic who really can see dead people, so much so in fact that he has befriended three ghosts and makes a living out of setting up hauntings and charging people to exorcise the spirits. However, things turn decidedly deadly when he encounters a grim reaper like spirit that is killing people and putting a number on their foreheads. It seems there is a serial killing spirit on the loose.

Frank Bannister (Fox) is grieving from the death of his wife and he has become a conman, this is an interesting characterisation for Fox to play and he does so with relish. Initially the pic is all about the comedy, with Bannister's interactions with the three ghosts devilishly funny. Ok, the effects work now look a bit crude, but there's a vibrancy on offer both visually and orally.

Come the second third the pic shifts into a serial killer investigation and the narrative gets dark. Oh there's still fun in the mix, but Jackson and his team are toying with the very real facet of a celebrity serial killer (ebulliently played by Jake Busey). Trini Alvarado (what happened to her?) is playing what ends up as Bannister's side-kick and love interest and the pair of them are thrust into a frantic final third of a life and death battle with Busey's psychotic spirit Johnny Bartlett. Bartlett in turn is aided by mentally ill Patricia Bradley (horror icon Dee Wallace Stone), while an outrageously over the top Jeffrey Combs is in the mix as a damaged FBI agent intent on destroying bannister and all he stands for.

When you strip it down it's a live action horror comedy cartoon, which when you look in context to Jackson's early work is not surprising. It's also not surprising that The Frighteners has become a cult movie of some standing. The bonkers plot, the close to the knuckle humour and choice narrative threads make it a fascinating viewing experience. 7.5/10",7.0

10780,"This movie wouldn’t make any of my top 20 lists (if I took the time to create some) but I think it is a charming film, and that is quite an accomplishment. Because if it weren’t for the talented ensemble main actors, Garry Marshall directing, and a witty script (the writer has Pay it Forward and others on her resume), this movie could easily have been a stinker. As it is, it has a lot of laughs, cute child actors, some character development, and a fun time for all. 

It is priceless to watch the Goldie Hawk character go from snooty, haughty rich bitch, to a sensitive self-deprecating amnesiac mom who is not cut out for motherhood and in over her head.  What she learns about herself doesn’t come from her memory, but from what the Kurt Russell character relates to her, so she hears how she had sex with him their first date and she says, “I’m a slut.” Sexist, of course, but at least she is saying it about herself, and she does come through for her ‘family’ in the end.

It is a harmless good time. I wouldn’t go out of my way to watch it, but I wouldn’t change channels if it came on either. As an aside, I haven’t seen the remake, so I can’t make comparisons. Probably should judge both on their own merits anyway, right?",8.0
10784,"Set against a backdrop of rising Nazi power in Berlin in the early 1930s, this is a wonderfully colourful and sexually provocative piece of musical cinema that centres around the cabaret in the ""Kit Kat Club"". Introduced by the outstandingly ambiguous Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies, we are introduced to the star attraction - ""Miss Sally Bowles"" (Liza Minnelli) and for the next two hours we see aspects of their stage entertainment interspersed with her life, and that of her new-found friend ""Brian"" (Michael York) as they fall in and out of love, of bed - and of bed with their friend ""Max"" (Helmut Griem) too! Just to defuse some of that intensity, there is a parallel storyline featuring the lovestruck ""Fritz"" (Fritz Wepper) who is the initially gold-digging, but ultimately sincere suitor for the hand of the Jewish heiress ""Natalia"" (Marisa Berenson). The threads of the story are perfectly knitted together by Bob Fosse, who demonstrates the odious political and anti-semitic politics whilst also presenting us with some wonderfully entertaining dance numbers staged within the confines of a real theatre. This gives us an added intimacy and richness to the performances. We see their faces, the holes in their stockings, the audience are in the thick of things and frequently participants (willingly or not!). Of course, the whole thing is really about the superb voice of Miss Minnelli - and ""Money, Money""; ""Cabaret"" and the show stopping ""Maybe This Time"" from Messrs. Kander & Ebb are the stuff of showbiz legend. Also, to be fair - which I am not always to Michael York; he turns in an honest and authentic effort as the hapless young Englishman who must adapt to his new friends and surroundings. I saw this on stage very recently, and thoroughly enjoyed it. This is as close a representation to theatre staging as I reckon it is possible to make and I thoroughly enjoyed it too!",7.0
10784,"**With qualities and many problems, it is a film that proves that the Oscars do not make films immortal or more significant.**

It's hard for me to believe how this film dominated the 1972 Oscar ceremony. That night, it proved to be a devourer of statuettes in a head-to-head duel with “Godfather”, Coppola's greatest work, winning eight awards: Best Original Soundtrack, Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Actress (for Liza Minelli) and Best Supporting Actor. I know that a lot of people like to detract from the Oscars and I agree with some of their arguments, but it will be an award to be taken into account as long as it is the most prestigious cinematographic award in the world. And let's face it: eight Oscars is a lot. After seeing the film, however, I started to think that, despite his qualities, he may have been too lucky.

The film gives Liza Minelli everything she needs to shine as a top star, even though until then she could barely call herself an actress: apart from a few minor roles, she had only made two films and none of them left any relevant memory. Without much effort and with everything helping, she shows us great commitment, charisma and presence, absolutely dominating the scene. She deserves an applause and her work makes the film better. The film also features the hard-working and committed participation of Joel Grey, as the cabaret presenter. The rest of the cast is much weaker, with some actors, such as Marisa Berenson and Michael York, being particularly irritating.

Set in Berlin in the 1930s, it has good sets and costumes, managing to give us the flavor of the time and of moral decadence and the desire to escape the reality experienced in some parts of society. The cabaret is, therefore, a surreal bubble where reality does not exist. For this reason, the film fails to convey the idea of the growing popularity of the Nazis. As a musical, it's unlike any I've ever seen. In a film like “Mary Poppins”, for example, the music accompanies the action and the story doesn't stop because the characters sing and dance instead of walking and talking. Here, the songs interrupt the action and, sometimes, they do so in an unpleasant way, as if it were an intermission. To make things more difficult, the songs are uninteresting, ugly and don't stick with the ear. The film contains some nudity and touches on difficult themes (sex, abortion, homosexuality and prejudice), so it is completely unsuitable for very young children.

The biggest problem with the film is, for me, the story we are told and the fact that there isn't a single character capable of arousing any empathy. Sally, Minelli's character, is an irresponsible, self-centered, futile and toxic creature in every way, and the story told is ugly, self-indulgent, excessively bizarre and seems disorganized, very confusing and disjointed, a patchwork. surreal. Perhaps this explains why, despite the awards collected, and the qualities mentioned, this film ended up being forgotten, being unknown to most people who didn't see it at the time.",3.0
10785,"There are no enemies in science, only phenomena to be studied.  

The Thing from Another World is set at The North Pole and finds a bunch of U.S. airmen, scientists and a journalist getting more than they bargained for when they investigate a space craft frozen in the ice. 

What is most striking about the film is the basic human story of team work, the pulling together of mankind during a crisis, this theme is a big shift from the short story by John W Campbell Jr. (Who Goes There?). Where that story and later John Carpenter's wonderful remake focused on paranoia and mistrust, this film is something of the ""polar"" opposite (literally) as regards the group in peril. It bears all the hallmarks of producer Howard Hawks, who clearly influenced Nyby's direction. The script, with its pros and cons of a military and scientific society, is very much of its time, blending po-faced observations with straight backed joviality. But this all works in the film's favour and helps define it as one of the most important science fiction pictures ever made. 

Along with the other major sci-fi movie of 1951, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""TTFAW"" firmly brought the visitor from outer space idea into the public conscious. But where the former film intellectualised the alien visitor, resplendent with a message of worth, the latter is about terror, pushing forward the notion that the visitor here is a monster that wants to drink our blood and attempt World domination. No major effects work is needed here because one of the pic's highlights is only glimpsing the creature (James Arness) in little snippets, and this after we are made to wait for some time before things really kick off. This begs us to think for ourselves as regards this stalking menace, putting us firmly with this intrepid group of people, and we want to see them survive and we do care if they can or do succeed. 

The low end budget doesn't hamper the atmosphere or flow, in fact Nyby, Hawks, cinematographer Russell Harlan and music maestro Dimitri Tiomkin, work wonders to ensure there's a level of authenticity to the Arctic base and that peril is never far away. Not hindered by many of the clichés that would dominate similar themed genre pieces that followed it, film neatly taps into fears that were to become prevalent as the 1950s wore on. It may not be perfect, but a genre star it still be - so watch the sky tonight indeed. 9/10",9.0
10785,"**_Stuck at an isolated arctic station with some… Thing_**

Scientists at a base in the frozen North discern the crash-landing of an unknown vessel 50 miles away, which they naturally investigate with the corresponding militarists. They bring a mysterious frozen specimen back to the station. Big mistake.

“The Thing From Another World” (1951) was the first attempt to film John W. Campbell’s novella Who Goes There? Being shot in 1950, there’s a quaintness to the proceedings compared to the 1982 version with Kurt Russell or the 2011 prequel.

This version lacks the grimness of those two future renditions and the extraterrestrial (played by towering James Arness) is lame by comparison. We know from “War of the Worlds” and “The Blob” that flicks from the 50s can feature effective alien creatures and be genuinely scary, but I can’t really say that about this B&W classic, although there’s of course SOME creepiness at the remote station.

On the positive side, the elaboration on a mysterious plant-based lifeform from another planet is well-done and interesting. So is the contention between Capt. Hendry (Kenneth Tobey), who is intent on saving lives, and Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), who believes scientific discovery is above all, even above all lives on Earth. Speaking of which, the idea about the possible global threat of the lifeform is later explored in the great “Species.”

I suggest watching the 2011 and 1982 movies (in that order) and, if you want more, check out this classic for an alternative take on Campbell’s novella, assuming you don’t mind old-fashioned filmmaking and B&W photography.

The movie runs 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles (including at the Ice & Cold Storage Company in order to show condensed breath in the interiors); second unit work was done at Glacier National Park, Montana.

10786,"_**Robin Hood returns to England in his grey years**_

Coming back from the Crusades, Robin Hood and Little John (Sean Connery and Nicol Williamson) are still serving under King Richard the Lionhearted (Richard Harris) in France before finally making it back to England and reuniting with Marian (Audrey Hepburn) and their old nemesis the Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw).   

Directed by Richard Lester, ""Robin and Marian"" (1976) has an odd tone, combining the brutal realities of Medieval Europe with subtle humor and nobility. The fun element is low-key and meshed with melancholy, but such ‘dark comedy’ is lost on many today (even I had to acclimate). However, if you think about it, the blockbuster “Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves” (1991) had a similar mixed tone. 

In any case, the movie emphasizes the betrayal of aging; how the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Past glories and past loves are yearned for, but the passing decades have changed everything forever. On top of this, you get real-life castles, authentic Medieval garb and a great, realistic swordfight between two aging men before the controversial close (controversial to others, not me). 

Pompous King Richard’s shocking atrocities in the opening act are contrasted by the Sheriff of Nottingham (Shaw), who has mellowed with age and has leaned something of compassion and respect.  He’s older and wiser now, less disposed to unfair treatment. His present reign seems to be rather benign and not overly oppressive. He has a limp along with the generally slower movement that comes with age. When he comes to the edge of Sherwood Forest with his small army his strategy is to wait Robin Hood out for surrender, presumably to spare Robin's life and allow his followers to simply go back to their farms or what have you. This is a welcome surprise and shows that this is not just Sean Connery’s movie, but Shaw’s as well. Notice how, after a prayer in the field before their mano a mano duel, Robin assists the Sheriff to his feet before they begin.

Concerning King Richard, his fate in the movie is similar to the way it went down in real life, except that it was by a vengeful boy using a crossbow and, like in the film, he was using a frying pan for a shield. The kid’s name was Pierre Basile and the incident happened at the siege of Châlus-Charbrol in central France on March 26, 1199. Although Richard generously forgave him and set him free, he was flayed alive the day Richard passed away on April 6, 1199 at the order of Richard’s infamous mercenary captain Mercadier.

This rendition of Robin Hood features perhaps the best depiction of Little John by Nicol Williamson, at least as far as getting to know the character and caring about him. You’ll note that he too loves Marian, albeit secretly. Speaking of Marian, this was Hepburn’s first film in almost a decade after taking a break to raise her family.

If you appreciate “Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves” or “Robin Hood” (2010), be sure to check this one out as it’s a quality interpretation of Robin in his older years. True, Connery was only 45 years-old during shooting and Russell Crowe was the same age when he did his version, but 45 was fairly old in Medieval times. The only negatives are the aforementioned curious tone, which you have to get used to, and the lack of lushness in the locales, which betrays that the flick was not shot in England.

The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in the Navarra region of northeastern Spain and Villalonso, Zamora, Castilla y León in northwestern Spain.

There's a snow storm blowing ferociously, a man trundles towards a signpost that reads Iping. He enters a hostelry called The Lions Head, the patrons of the bar fall silent for the man is bound in bandages. He tells, not asks, the landlady; ""I want a room with a fire"". This man is Dr. Jack Griffin, soon to wreak havoc and be known as The Invisible Man.

One of the leading lights of the Universal Monster collection of films that terrified and enthralled audiences back in the day. Directed by genre master James Whale, The Invisible Man is a slick fusion of dark humour, berserker science and genuine evil. Quite a feat for a film released in 1933, even more so when one samples the effects used in the piece. Effects that are still today holding up so well they put to shame some of the toy like expensive tricks used by the modern wave of film makers. John P. Fulton take a bow sir.

After Boris Karloff had turned down the chance to play the good doctor gone crazy, on account of the role calling for voice work throughout the film only, except a snippet at the finale, so Whale turned to Claude Rains. Small in stature but silky in voice, Rains clearly sensed an opportunity to launch himself into Hollywood. It may well be, with Whale's expert guidance of course, that he owes his whole career to that 30 second appearance of his face at the end of the film? As was his want, Whale filled out the support cast with odd ball eccentrics that are acted adroitly by the British & Irish thespians. Una O'Connor, Forrester Harvey, Edward E. Clive and Henry Travers are memorable. While American Gloria Stuart as the power insane Griffin's love interest is radiant with what little she has to do. 

Based on the now famous story written by H.G. Wells, Whale and R. C. Sheriff's (writer) version remains the definitive Invisible Man adaptation. There's some changes such as the time it is set, and Griffin is not the lunatic he is in the film, which is something that Wells was not too pleased about in spite of liking the film as a whole, but it's still very tight to the source. Sequels, TV series and other modern day adaptations would follow it, but none are as shrewd or as chilling as Whale's daddy is. 9/10",9.0
10787,"We all know that necessity is the mother of invention, but there is another saying in Spanish that roughly translates to ‘sloth/laziness is the mother of all vices’ (the closest English equivalent I can think of is ‘idle hands are the devil’s playground’). I would say that the link between invention and laziness is largely computer-generated; that’s why a near-100 year-old movie such as The Invisible Man looks better than any modern CGI extravaganza, and it does so because it’s all there – even when it isn’t.

Jorge Luis Borges once wrote about all the trouble that H.G. Wells’s Invisible Man has to go to (wigs, dark glasses, fake noses and beards, etc.) so that people can’t see that they can’t see him. Director James Whale went to similar great lengths to make sure we can see that there is someone we can’t see, and the sheer mechanical ingenuity devoted to making the titular character a tangible physical presence reminds me of the biblical admonition that “ye shall know them by their fruits”; Dr. Jack Griffin (Claude Rains) certainly puts the phrase ‘conspicuous by his absence’ in an entirely different perspective.

The flawlessness of the whole enterprise is made even more impressive when we consider that it was achieved with wires that had to be kept out of the shot because the technology to digitally delete them obviously didn’t exist yet. Other optical effects, involving the Invisible Man himself as opposed to his interactions with other people and objects, are less convincing, and at the same time aren’t – that is to say, any less convincing than today’s green screens, motion capture, and other assorted VFX.

The other major factor that sells the film is Rains’s performance. He evidently can’t emote (we only see his face until the very last shot, and even then in the stillness of death), but he more than makes up for that, first with body language – a category wherein I feel compelled to include the sight of Griffin’s (as Borges might say) autonomous pants skipping down a country road –, and later with his disembodied voice, which he contorts to fully convey the extent of the character’s madness.",6.0

It seems like I may be one of the few who didn't like it and even though ""The Abandoned"" is a watchable horror/drama flick that can be mostly appreciated for the nice imagery, I mostly found it redundant and tedious. To me, it was like an hour and a half of pointless sequences and bogus scares and while I do appreciate creative and artistic dark imagery, it can become ineffective when the story is not held properly. I mean, directors like Dario Argento can get away with plain stories, pointless sequences and underdeveloped characters... because he makes his films entertaining and puzzling. Nacho Cerdá, on the other hand, cannot. flawless and the setup is brilliant as well, but the movie still doesn't work. Why? because it's tedious! I'm pretty sure that several ""serious"" movie lovers will claim that people who think this film is dull, it's because they are untrained watchers who can only appreciate torture porn and fast-paced films with a lot of action. Well, it's really not my case, because I actually have great tolerance for low-paced films. The low-pace, in several films serves a purpose, but not with this film.

In ""The Abandoned"", a film producer named Marie, who lives in the United States with her young daughter, goes back to her homeland in Russia, when she is informed that she has inherited an old house from her parents. Unfortunately for her, the place is situated in the middle of nowhere and Marie is not exactly familiarized with the Russian language or the culture in general. Without having a clue of anything, she intends to visit the place anyway with the help of a guide, who disappears in the middle of the night under strange circumstances. Completely desperate and with no one else to turn to, Marie starts looking for her guide, without realizing that something is waiting for her out there: Secrets from the past, that have been waiting for over 40 years, and that she's about to discover in the worst possible way.

This was really a great disappointment for me. I was expecting a promising story, exploring a family drama and all I got, was the same worn out plot about the impossibility of escaping fate and our past (I think we had enough of that silliness already). I guess ""The Abandoned"" is overall watchable. Definitely not a masterpiece, but still not the worst movie ever. A movie that is going to be appreciated mostly by people who are in favor of those long and unnecessary situations that lead to nothing whatsoever and video-game sequences that don't add anything at all. By the way, the story supposedly takes place in Russia, even though it was actually filmed in Bulgaria and they didn't do a very good job hiding it.

Unfortunately people are reviewing this with an eye to the present and claiming that it stereotypes Gay men, and it does to an extent, but I do believe that a lot of the single star reviews would have made the same complaint no matter what they did with the lead character.

The fact is, for its time, for its era, it was part of the wave of films and TV shows that helped to normalize homosexuality in America, and it's that normalization that, more than any activism, helped for the Civil Rights victories we are seeing in the present.

To shun it over politics is literally to bite the hand that feeds you, especially since it has a clear message that homophobia is wrong and it was movies and TV shows like this that helped bring the attitudes and views on homosexuality that everyone supports today.

10823,"And a child shall lead them... 

Who would have thunk it, that one of Stephen King's short stories would spawn a gargantuan movie franchise? Children of the Corn is one of those movies that horror fans of a certain age, who started to blossom in the 1980s, remember fondly but agree that now it's a bit, well, corny.

Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton get trapped in a village of the damned where the children have killed the adults and established a religious order that gives worship to the devil of the corn. Isaac Chroner (John Franklin) and Malachai Boardman (Courtney Gains) head the creepy kid cult, corn does sway, blood does flow, poor special effects do down the devil, yet it's atmospheric as heck fire and still a bunch of fun if you forgive it its dated foibles. 6/10",6.0
10823,"***Children of the damned… in the cornfields of the American prairie***

A young couple traveling through the endless cornfields of Nebraska (Peter Horton & Linda Hamilton) visits a town so far off the beaten track it’s not even on the map. Yet it seems abandoned, except for some kids scurrying around. Horror ensues.

“Children of the Corn” (1984) takes the remote Plains town setting of “The Last Picture Show” (1971) and gives it a horror spin based on Stephen King’s short story. The later “Husk” (2011) used the same template. King, however, wasn’t pleased with the results, as conveyed in his statement: ""My feeling is like a guy who sends his daughter off to college. You hope she'll do well. You hope she won't fall in with the wrong people. You hope she won't be raped at a fraternity party, which is pretty well what happened to Children of the Corn.""

The uninhabited town with scavenging kids makes the film come across as a post-apocalyptic flick. The protagonists are likable and the movie works up some creepy rural mood. People have described the film as sacrilegious, but it’s clear that the kids’ hybrid religion is not a true expression of Christianity since it’s clearly sullied by “he who walks behind the rows.” One of the picture’s criticisms is the ambiguity of this thing, but I suppose enough is revealed to put the pieces together. Still, the lack of exposition is disappointing. And the gaudy effects in the last act are lousy.

Another arguable negative is the portrayal of the cult with the use of child & teen actors. I think they did pretty good all things considered. The growing schism between leader Isaac (John Franklin) and chief disciple Malachai (Courtney Gains) is interesting. It’s just difficult to portray diabolic cults, like witches and satanists, without getting eye-rolling and laughable. 

In any case, imagine the casting auditions for Malachai wherein the producers are looking for a tall teenage boy with a mean face and shocking mane. Courtney Gains enters the room and answers some questions when the producers state: ""This is going well; you've just about got it clinched. But, as a formality, could you shout ‘Outlander’ at the top of your lungs?”

Ass Blasters R US!

The third movie in the Tremors series of films is adequate entertainment for the fans. Michael Gross returns as Burt, who in turn returns to Perfection to find it a tourist haven of Graboid fans. Into the mix is a nefarious real estate deal that threatens the very existence of the townsfolk. But of course, the Graboids and their mutated offspring don’t care about such things.

If not expecting too much then this serves up some good straight to video fun. The formula remains the same, with Burt the paranoid saviour of perfection getting some good lines, while the return of characters from the first film is a splendid bonus for the fans.

10830,"**An excellent family comedy with some social criticism in the mix.**

The film is one of the most famous family comedies of the 1990s, adapting the story of the same name by Roald Dahl for the screen, where a girl, who was born into an idiotic family unable to understand it, decides to win the right to go to school and to learn, which their parents do not value. However, at school, she comes across a cruel and sadistic headmistress who will become her biggest adversary, while her teacher becomes her best friend.

It's a very good and enjoyable film, with a nice comedy genre and some fantasy. The characters are reasonably well done, albeit a bit artificial in their conception, and the cast is very good. Mara Wilson, despite her youth, shone in the lead role and guaranteed the start of her acting career. Danny DeVito, who also ensures an effective and well-executed direction, does a very intelligent job as an actor, being well assisted by Rhea Perlman. And while Embeth Davidtz delivers a good performance, it's Pam Ferris's overwhelming and committed performance as a villain that steals our attention, in a work that is as iconic and striking as it is histrionic and over-the-top.

It may go unnoticed, in the midst of the comedy and lightness of the film itself, but I felt that there is here, well marked in the Wormwoods, a harsh sarcastic critique of a certain American middle class: like many American families, they learned to do everything, or almost everything, in front of the television screen, and they do not value each other, being in every respect a largely dysfunctional family. He's a crook, she's vain, vain and addicted to gambling, the eldest son doesn't seem to have any prospects for the future or know what he wants from his own life. As a family, they value nothing but easy money, as evidenced by the weird TV show style they adore and the cheap, tasteless decor of their home. Despite everything, they think they are much smarter than others for being that way.

Technically, it's a low-key film. The cinematography is in line with what one would expect in a comic film of this decade, prolific in good comedies, and the sets and costumes are good and convincing, particularly the school. The film has some special, visual and sound effects, most of which do their job well, without demerits. The soundtrack, composed by David Newman, doesn't bring anything really remarkable.",9.0

Suzman is great, as is Lambert and though I found Higgins just a bit weak to sustain the title role, this is still a great and entertaining ensemble effort well complimented by Michael Nyman's lively and Handel-esque score.

On the other end of it, while I'm less of a fan, Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman, and Ray Liotta play out a must more complicated parallel love story that lends towards the hustle more than any traditional version of love.

It was the first time, to my knowledge, that I saw a film made in Hong Kong. John Woo, its director, gained some international notoriety and would even, long after this film, have some work in western cinema. In general, I liked the movie. I'm not an undefeated fan of action cinema, but I felt that this film manages to balance the explosive action (even better and more intense than in North American films) with a satisfying script. The story revolves around a professional killer who, after accidentally blinding a bar singer, starts to protect her. He will, however, have to kill a mobster and escape from the police, who understand the relationship between the singer and the bandit and start to watch her.

Chow Yun-Fat is the film's lead actor, and the only actor I somehow remember seeing, though I can't say where. He is charismatic and intense, and makes his character a tough man but, at the same time, able to capture the audience's sympathy. Danny Lee, in the role of a police inspector, and Sally Yeh, as the singer, also give us a pleasant job.

The film's focal point is the intense, explosive action. No means were spared in achieving impressive fight and shootout scenes, and in that respect, both the stuntmen and the special effects team deserve praise. The film has good sets and costumes, and the cinematography has a visual beauty very typical of oriental films, where the color is intense, vivid, something important and always valued. The film is about an hour and a half long, but the pace is quite slow, denoting a certain stretch of the script, and this is the biggest negative criticism I can give it.",7.0

10838,"A good movie could be made about the goings-on in the Demeter (the Russian ship that brings Count Dracula to England in Bram Stoker's novel), which could play out as a sort of Ur-Alien. Now, the latter doesn’t mean that it would perforce have to occur in space; it’s never a good idea to put an earthbound monster in orbit (1985’s Lifeforce kinda went there, though not all the way, with mixed but mostly good results).

According to AllMovie, Dracula 3000 ""includes a stellar exploitation cast, including Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister Jr., and a special guest appearance from Udo Kier."" I can’t decide if the «stellar» is meant to be ironic or not; on the other hand, any appearance by Kier is bound to be special — not to say almost obligatory in a vampire movie.

If the revered German actor played the titular character, there might be hope yet for this movie; Kier, however, or anyone else for that matter, can’t play the titular character because the villain is not Dracula but Orlock (like the antagonist in Nosferatu only with an extra 'c').

To call this movie chauvinistic would be an understatement. It’s not so much that 187 tells Aurora that he would like to ""ejaculate on [her] bazongas;"" it’s that she’d probably enjoy that, considering that her character, more than being sexually objectified, turns out to be a literal sex object (a ""pleasure-bot,"" to be exact).",1.0

Out on the Eastern Front 1943, battered by the war itself, a war they are losing, a platoon of German soldiers must also cope with a new aristocratic commander who deeply covets the Cross Of Iron, Germany's highest medal of honour.

Universally hated and panned by the critics upon release, Cross Of Iron now stands up as one of director Sam Peckinpah's finest works. On first glance it would seem to have been a strange film (genre) for Peckinpah to tackle, but scratch away at the scabs left by Peckinpah's trademark violence, and you see underneath that it sits comfortably with his character driven Western fables. 

Adapting from the much lauded novel by Willi Heinrich, Peckinpah is bleakly telling of men in combat, men who are not here for heroics, they are merely trying to survive, the realities of war draining their last bit of strength by the day. Then it's at the mid point when you realise that Peckinpah (possibly chuckling away into his stein of beer) has neatly led us into sympathy for the enemy of the good old war film, the German soldier. All cloaked by death dealer Peckinpah himself, with slow-mo blood baths and poetic like harshness emphasising the story unfolding. Men, true to the director's form, are defined by what they do above all else, regardless of the consequences. Men perfectly portrayed by James Coburn (never better) as Feldwebel Rolf Steiner and Maximilian Schell as Hauptmann Stransky, giving us men from different spectrum's who have differing ideals in life. 

Also evident is a classic Peckinpah theme of establishment superiors trying to stamp down on the ""real"" men, the irony of such being that this was yet another Peckinpah film beset with interference outside of his control. Cut and tampered with, it's only now that we can see Pekinpah's actual uncut version of the film - so accept nothing that runs under 130 minutes on Home Formats. From the opening montage of WWII footage, played out as German children sing a haunting little ditty, to the climatic, almost surreal finale as Coburn maniacally laughs into the end credits (be sure to watch these to the end for Bertolt Brecht's bitter quote closure), this is no ordinary war film. It's all shot expertly by cinematographer John Coquillon. So with the ugly themes of moral corruption and the shattering of youthful innocence, this is one unpleasant, even insane picture. In short, Cross Of Iron ""is"", as Orson Welles was known to say, one of the greatest anti-war films ever made. 9/10",9.0
10839,"**_Brutal Germans vs. Russians WW2 flick with James Coburn and Maximilian Schell_**

As defeat looms on the Eastern Front, an awarded, but battle-worn German NCO (Coburn) vies with a newly-appointed captain, a Prussian aristocrat, who’s obsessed with obtaining the Iron Cross (Schell), even if he has to get it by fraud. James Mason and David Warner have peripheral roles.

Loosely based on the true story of Johann Schwerdfeger, “Cross of Iron” (1977) was helmed by Sam Peckinpah and, therefore, is unsurprisingly filled with bloody carnage (much of it in slow-motion), alcohol-consumption and a generally pessimistic view of life. As typical, the protagonist is a loner who desires to be honorable but is forced to do whatever is necessary to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality.

Some might complain that Coburn was 48 playing a man who was 28 at the time of the events. Yet producers were naturally more interested in a big-name actor with the charisma to fill seats at the cinema than they were in being technically accurate. And, honestly, Coburn’s performance is one of the top attractions.

As far as I know, this was the first major film released in North America to be set on the Eastern Front. Since the protagonists were Germans it’s no surprise that it didn’t do well in the US and Canada, but it was successful in Europe and has developed a strong cult following.

The core story needed to be better elucidated, but if you use the subtitles it isn’t too difficult to figure out. People complain about the disorienting combat sequences (right out of the gate), which is valid, but they successfully depict how modern combat is experienced by those in the field.

Despite the film’s issues, there are several highlights, including the great action, the palpable tension between Steiner and Stransky, Coburn and Schell’s performances, the bleak reflections on life and the late sequence involving a female Russian detachment.

But why does Steiner hate ALL officers, which strikes me as unconvincing? What's he expect, that there be NO ONE in charge of strategic military operations? If someone respects & supports you, like Col. Brandt does with Steiner, you should appreciate it. I think it comes down to how battle-weary Steiner was, not to mention he didn't even believe in the Nazi-led cause of Germany. I also believe it's a matter of Steiner being a sigma male while officers are typically alpha males.

Brandt"" (James Mason) to nominate him for an Iron Cross. He cites two officers as the witnesses to his bravery, but ""Steiner"" decides not to play ball. ""Stransky"" is livid, but plays a long game that ends up seeing the squad left unaware of marching orders and left adrift in the face of an enemy with overwhelming superiority. ""Steiner"" must now galvanise his already exhausted and demoralised soldiers and try to work their way through increasingly hostile territory to make it back to their own lines. Sam Peckinpah uses the Soviets as his foe here so that avoids any unpatriotic accusations back home, and allows him to deliver a gritty and authentic looking wartime drama that focusses way more on the human beings involved. Their flaws and their strengths are illustrated as each is tested to his own individual breaking point - all whilst shells and bullets fall around them. Coburn was a master of the less-is-more style - his demeanour and facial expressions did most of his acting for him, and there's also a strong contribution from David Warner as the battle-weary ""Kiesel"". James Mason, I felt, wasn't quite a natural here but in the end it all comes down to a battle of wills between the entitled ""Stransky"" and the experienced ""Steiner"" who lock horns effectively. The production and photography really capture well the degradation in which these soldiers - and the locals they encounter along the way - lived their lives. In muddy squalor with little food and and some almost animalistic instincts at times, too.

Is this some hillbilly reality show type of thing?--Kat

Eight young college students are on their way to Florida for spring break when they all take a shortcut through a southern town who has a strange way of showing southern hospitality.

MY THOUGHTS

I see our barb-a-cuties got the skewering rod raring to go.--Mayor Buckman

We have eight interesting kills. I’m not counting the town people who died over 150 years earlier. We get drawn and quartered, acid funneled down one's throat, a bell crushing someone, and that’s just three of them. One of the more painful ones that had me cringe was when the two girls rammed a rod through Ricky’s ass going all the way through him and coming out his mouth. Ouch! All of the kills were decently made and creative. 

We have some great genre actors in 2001 Maniacs. Robert England (known as Freddy Krueger in the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and several other horror movies) plays Mayor Buckman, the mayor of Pleasant Valley, a confederate town during the Civil War days where northern aggressors wiped out the town. And Lin Shaye (known for Critters 1-2, Hood of Horror, Insidious franchise, A Nightmare on Elm Street 1 and New Nightmare, Ouija, and several other horror movies. She’s also the sister of Producer Robert Shaye.) plays Granny Boone, kind of the matriarch of the town. Both did great with their roles.

The rest of the actors did a decent job with their roles. The college kids were just annoying enough that you rooted for them to die. The exception is Anderson and Joey who you hoped would live but die in the end.

We start with 3 college friends who are heading for Florida for spring break. At a gas station they run into 3 other people also going to Florida. Anderson, one of the guys from the original group has his eyes on the hot blonde from the second group. Joey seems to like him too, but they go their separate ways. 

The next day our three guys find a small town called Pleasant Valley that is having a summer celebration called Guts and Glory. They decide to check out the celebration because everyone is so friendly. Soon after they arrive, the other group of friends show up there as well, followed by a biker couple. Somehow the mayor and the townspeople get them to stay overnight. Despite their racist comments about the biker couple who are African American and Asian. 

One of the young ladies eyes one hick and she goes off with him to make out. He blindfolds her and when he takes the blindfold off, all her limbs are tied to different horses. He makes a comment and then sets the horses off, tearing off her arms and legs.

For the rest of the movie they are basically singled out and killed. One guy is seduced by a milkmaid and pressured into funneling what he thought was moonshine, which turns out to be acid.

The next day the girls are sent with Granny Boone to get pampered and dancing. We have two girls left when Joey decides to leave and find Anderson. At this point Ricky shows up and joins in the fun. Unfortunately while the girls are singing they don’t pay attention to the words. If they had then they may have lived. The one girl there stands under a bell and Granny Boone pulls a rope, dropping the bell on her, killing her. 

Ricky runs off, but is captured by the guy he hooked up with the night before. He gets a pretty painful ending. They have him held over a table while two girls ram a rod up his butt, coming out of his mouth.

Now at this point, why are the remaining people not wondering where their friends are? Finally Joey does when one girl is holding her friend's dog tags that she would never have let anyone have.

The one nerdy friend (which all of these kinds of movies have) finally gets a girl to pay attention to him. Unfortunately, while she is going down on him, she puts in her mouth some sort of metallic teeth. And you can guess what she does. Yep, she bites his dick off.

Now the biker guy is wondering where his girlfriend is when he thinks he sees her run off. He chases her and it turns out not to be her. He gets caught and killed by some sort of press that the townspeople push until his eyes pop out.

It’s down to our last two survivors: Joey and Anderson. She is tied to a chair and Anderson to the table. Anderson gets free and fights the mayor, only to force him to let them go. The mayor gives his word that they can go and the couple drive off on the motorcycle.

The next morning the couple shows up to the police station telling the cops what happened. The sheriff (?) takes them back to the location and it’s just a graveyard. He tells them how over 150 years ago the northern army came through and killed everyone. He explains that every year some drunk college kids pull pranks saying the same thing they were saying. 

Anderson apologizes and says they will leave. As they leave the area they end up hitting a wire that beheads them. The final victims of Pleasant Valley that year.

Overall, I found this movie a fun, bloody and gory ride. There were times I was rooting for the college kids to die as well as the townspeople. I found the movie was made really well and if you don’t mind the nudity (LOL), and some of the rather colorful language, then you should check out this movie. If nothing else, for the kills and the great Robert England and Lin Shaye.

And now for your Forever Final Girl Exclusive…Did you know?:

Robert Englund and Lin Shaye appeared in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994), and Wish You Were Dead (2001).
2001 Maniacs serves as both a sequel, as well as soft reboot to Herschell Gordon Lewis’ 1964 cult classic Two Thousand Maniacs.
The plot point of the massacred town in Georgia was loosely inspired by General Sherman’s destructive march through Georgia, which left Atlanta burnt to the ground.
Both Tim Sullivan and Chris Kobin (screenwriter) returned 5 years later to make a sequel, 2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams. However, Robert Englund was recast without his knowledge.
There were two notable cameos: Kane Hodder plays a man who seizes Anderson right before the big fight between Anderson and Mayor Buckman. And Eli Roth who plays a man whose armadillo is hit by a car near the beginning of the movie. He plays the same character he played in his own feature directorial debut, 2002 Cabin Fever.

10854,"Something Wicked Thus Way Comes.

A widow and her daughters move into the inherited family home and get terrorised by “zombie” kids from the local Carlton mining disaster that occurred many years earlier.

You know very early from the off that we the audience are going to be asked a lot of as regards character behaviours and rationales. The grieving mother moves herself and her daughters into what can only be described as an isolated pig sty, and right from the off all the warning signs are there for them that all is not well in this part of town.

Story unravels in standard revenge from the grave formation, but the setting is very much in the film’s favour even if the core story is not. Creepy forest, crumbling abodes and the spectre of the mine disaster ready to unleash its secret. The kids themselves are actually ghosts who eat meat, human or animal, so it was a tenuous marketing strategy to be calling it a zombie film.

However, the kids themselves are splendidly ghoulish, pale faced and dark eyed, these very much are creepy kids. Low tone cinematography and gentle pacing help the mood considerably, and cast performances are fine given that the writing saddles them with weak dialogue exchanges and drawn out sequences obviously used to extend the running time. A teen romance strand involving the eldest daughter also just feels like filler.

A modest spooker but certainly watchable enough, atmosphere and location setting ensure this is the case. 4/10",4.0
10857,"“When The Wind Blows” is a heartbreaking, horrendous, portrayal of the fallout following a nuclear attack on the United Kingdom. Based on the book by “The Snowman” creator Raymond Briggs, this film manages to show the full horror of an elderly couples experiences once missiles have struck.

Opening with real Cold War era footage accompanied by David Bowie’s haunting theme song, “When The Wind Blows” follows similar animation style to that of Briggs other famous works. ( “The Snowman” , “The Snowman and the Snow Dog” ) Such dark narrative seems unfitting for this animation style but it works perfectly. The innocence of the two main characters as they desperately try to follow official advice while believing their idyllic village life will one day return to normal is heartbreaking. It’s impossible not to warm to Jim and Hilda as they slowly succumb to the effects of radiation sickness and the realisation of what has become of the World they knew. 

What is extremely clever is how the narrative incorporates the official United Kingdom protect and survive leaflet issued at the time by the government of the day. This adds realism to the proceedings as Jim and Hilda carry out the instructions in the leaflet, clearly unaware of the absurdity and horror of their situation.

Brilliantly written and heightened through the animation the story and premise is starkly worrying today as it was in 1986",9.0
10858,"Wow, this was a pretty fair movie wasn't it? And it came from Oliver Stone. One would almost expect it to be a paranoid mess, but it was done pretty well.

Hopkins did a great job too... except maybe looking a little too old for the role, but he captured a lot of Nixon's mannerisms, a lot of how he spoke and moved. It was far from uncanny, but he really did nail the essence of the character and that is almost better than cloning him.

Joan Allen fails though. She doesn't exactly ape Pat as well as she could and you are left with the impression that she doesn't understand who she was depicting.

And then you have little hints at the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories and, even though I supported them, I don't think that they had a place in a movie about Nixon. They felt alien and X-Files and you are left doubting that said conversation ever took place.

Aside from all of that, though, this seems like a great film that was fairly done, about someone that it would have been far too easy to stereotype as a drooling monster. Stone humanized him, and that took heart and talent.",10.0
10859,"""Stakeout"" is a perfectly packaged film which has been expertly crafted to successfully achieve maximum results. It has been aimed directly at the commercial market and this would ordinarily mean a somewhat cynical and by-the-numbers motion picture experience with lots of money thrown at it to accommodate the noisy action sequences with very little attention being paid to the rest of it. Of course a good deal of that also applies here, although with the significant difference being a lot more attention has been paid to making this entertaining above all else. What all this amounts to on this occasion is a very engaging and well paced film with considerably more depth of character and story than you would expect and it has a fair share of humorous and perilous surprises thrown into the mix for good measure.",10.0
10860,"You can tell from the start that this was adapted from the stage. The dialogue--for the most part--has the same earnest theatrics as your average play, and honestly it works fairly well in a knock-off Tennessee Williams kind of way.

And the stage adaptation becomes even more evident when it shows itself to be a comedy tear-jerker.

And, as I said, that's fine. It has pro-talent and it's always nice to bring the stage into your living room from time to time.",10.0
10863,"**_To kill and love during WW2 with Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan_**

A German spy in Britain (Sutherland) has strategic info on the D-Day landing in 1944. As he tries to elude the authorities, he stumbles on a couple living remotely near the coast (Nelligan and Christopher Cazenove). Will he make it out? Who will live and who will die?

""Eye of the Needle” (1981) is a war drama/thriller, but not a conventional war movie. The plot has similarities to “The Eagle Has Landed” (1976) with the same actor as the spy (Sutherland). It’s almost as if they’re the same character. The difference is that “Eagle” features military combat whereas this one is decidedly a spy-on-the-run flick with the thrills thereof.

Like “Eagle,” this is easily one of Sutherland’s top movies. The British scenery is awesome, the palette is colorful, the adventure is compelling, the drama/romance is good and the suspense is off-the-charts in the final act.

There are elements of “The Eagle Has Landed,” “The Heroes of Telemark” (1965) and the later “The House on Carroll Street” (1988). If you like these flicks, this is a must; it’s as good or better than any of ’em.

The film runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, which is located in southwest Scotland, including Oban, nearby Connel Bridge and the Isle of Mull. Studio stuff was done in England in the greater London area, as well as the airport scene filmed at Blackbushe Airport.

10865,"Excellent.

I had previously heard a fair bit of hype down the years regarding <em>'Atlantis: The Lost Empire'</em> and now, finally, I can understand why. It is very good. My favourite part of it is the animation which is exquisite, especially across acts one and two with the great amount of detail. The characters are cool, while the premise is pretty fascinating.

Michael J. Fox is a superb cast as Milo, he is fantastic in the lead role. Honestly, none of the other voices stand out to me but that's not always a bad thing - especially in this film. There are no huge individual performances, away from Fox, but they all bounce off each other nicely.

The plot is very interesting, brought to life brilliantly by James Newton Howard's terrific score. It's not near the top of my Disney animated favourites, just through process of elimination really, but it certainly isn't majorly far off. It's a fun experience, one I'd recommend you see for yourself if you haven't done so already.",8.0
10865,"We start off watching the destruction of the legendary city before advancing several thousand years to meet ""Milo"" - a rather geeky young man whose grandfather had been obsessed with the mystery surrounding the lost continent. Gazillionaire ""Preston Whitmore"" recruits him on a perilous expedition to try and find the truth - so equipped with a submarine and a crew you just know have another agenda, off they go. The first forty minutes of this over-long adventure is much more reminiscent of something from Jules Verne, only spent on elongated character establishment scenarios, some borderline slapstick humour and by the time the film gets anywhere near it's sharp end, I could already feel a sense of ennui setting in. Michael J. Fox does inject some character as the young lad, and James Garner has his tongue firmly in his cheek as the completely untrustworthy ""Rourke"", but that can't really inject enough to create any sense of pace into this competently, but unremarkably, animated feature. The style of the artistry, though colourful, is clearly computer generated. The animations lack depth or texture and coupled with a really average storyline leaves this in a sort of Disney limbo. It is certainly not as bad as some that were produced ten years earlier, but it is still factory-style output that lacks for imagination and any of the traditional uniqueness that this studio used to deliver. It is watchable enough, but pretty forgettable.",6.0

Paul Walker shines as Lewis, grounding the film with a solid performance, while Steve Zahn’s portrayal of Fuller occasionally feels over the top. The suspense and tension are well-executed for much of the film, keeping viewers on edge, but the final act doesn’t live up to the buildup. The ending feels rushed and lacks the punch needed to leave a lasting impression. While entertaining, the movie falls short of its full potential with a script that could have used a stronger conclusion.",6.0
10867,"This movie is a masterpiece of storytelling. It explores the themes of loss, grief, and growing up in a captivating way that resonates with anyone who has faced challenges in life. It balances the drama with moments of humor, especially in the interactions between the young boy and his father, who have a realistic and touching bond. The ending was satisfying and emotional. The movie also excels in its visual aspects, with stunning cinematography, art direction, and setting that create a vivid atmosphere of the Sicilian culture and lifestyle of the time period in which the movie is set. The casting was spot on, with the young actor and Monica Bellucci delivering outstanding performances. Bellucci in particular impressed me with her expressive eyes in the market scene, where she conveyed the character’s feelings without words. As a man, I related a lot to Giuseppe Sulfaro character and his coming of age. Honestly, I didn't think I was going to like this movie as much I did when it finished. Rarely do I ever bother writing reviews for a movie I liked but this one I loved. Definitely worth a watch.",10.0
10868,"We start this film with the image of a young woman, half dressed, running in the rain screaming for help. It turns out she is ""Sarah"" (Jodie Foster) and after a passer-by takes her to hospital we learn that she has been gang raped in the games room of a bar. Deputy DA ""Murphy"" (Kelly McGillis) is assigned to the case, and although she believes her client, she is reluctant to prosecute as she doesn't think she can win. Her DA boss ""Rudolph"" (Carmen Argenziano) insists that they must change the accused three men with something, so they settle on a lesser charge after some plea bargaining. Needless to say, ""Sarah"" is livid, and tempers really flare when one of the other men from the bar that night, goads her into ramming her car into his. This is the point when the ambitious lawyer has a bit of a volte-face and despite the objections this time of her boss, she initiates a prosecution of the others in the bar for egging on the rapists - criminal solicitation. Can she prove these men are guilty? If so, that will also ensure those who got off lightly will also end up serving full sentences and have the nature of their sexual assaults placed on their criminal records. Foster is impressive here. She offers us a compelling portrayal of a young woman who suffers an heinous assault and struggles for justice. McGillis also delivers well, as does Bernie Coulson - the young ""Ken"" upon whom much of the chances of conviction rest. The graphically violent scenes towards the end of the trial stages are harrowing, disturbing and effective, and they also provide for an unnervingly nauseating performance from the vocal architect of her assault ""Scorpion"" (Leo Rossi). The drama is tough to watch, and offers food for thought as to just how victims can ever receive fair treatment in a legal environment that all too frequently takes a ""was she asking for it?"" approach, and is so oft just automatically stacked against them.",7.0
10869,"_**Herbie’s back**_

Tennessee Steinmetz’ aunt (Helen Hayes) is the new owner of Herbie and lives in a firehouse in San Francisco. A notorious real estate magnate (Keenan Wynn) wants her property to build a huge complex, but she won’t sell. When he sends his green lawyer nephew (Ken Berry) to persuade her, the nephew meets her displaced neighbor (Stefanie Powers) and changes sides. Can Herbie & Co. overcome the schemes of the dastardly mogul?    

""Herbie Rides again"" (1969) brings back the lovable Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of its own and a whole new cast. I like the fact that they completely changed direction and it has its points of interest, like the creative dream sequences and Herbie’s army, not to mention Berry and Powers. It’s cute and fun, but it’s probably my second least favorite of the franchise.     

The best ones for me are “Herbie Goes Bananas” (1980), “The Love Bug” (1997) and “Herbie Fully Loaded” (2005) with the 1997 one arguably being my favorite because it has a compelling story and features the Dark Herbie and Alexandra Wentworth.

Battle lines are drawn and soon the wrecking balls are at the ready, the cleaning foam hoses are primed and we get ninety minutes of rather predictable slap-stick capers. It's not that this is a bad film, indeed both Hayes and the megalomanic Wynn are both quite good, it's just that there's nowhere near enough of our magical car, and what we do get is all just a bit routine. Berry is a relatively charm free foil for what limited humour there is and the story is all just a bit too thin and procedural. It comes across as a sequel for the sake of it, rather than because anyone involved had any passion for the project, and though perfectly watchable it is equally perfectly forgettable.",6.0
10871,"Cause he told the truth, and once you've heard the truth, everything else is just cheap whiskey.

Switchback is written and directed by Jeb Stuart. It stars Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover, Jared Leto, R. Lee Ermey, Ted Levine and William Fitchner. Music is by Basil Poledouris and cinematography by Oliver Wood.

FBI agent Frank LaCrosse (Quaid) is tracking a serial killer who he believes kidnapped his young son.

Switchback is a standard serial killer based thriller that flopped at the box office. It's not a bad film but it never delivers on its potential. The location travelogue of the story is most impressive, especially the last third once we get to the snowy mountains of Colorado, but it's the scenery that grips and holds the attention more than the plot.

The red herrings have interest value enough for us to stay with what is at just under two hours a long film, but resolutions are either anti climatic or too obvious. Cast are a mixed bag, with Quaid just okay as the perpetually bleak protag and Glover sadly winding out as miscast once film shows its hands. Thankfully Leto and Ermey are on hand to keep a rein on things, playing the intended thriller tone just right as per their respective characters.

It's perhaps unlucky to have followed far superior/intelligent serial killer based thrillers, rendering it then and now as weak offerings. It's not the dead on stinker the box office suggests, and trimmed of 20 minutes it would have been a decent time waster, but as it is it plays out as unoriginal and lacking in directorial focus. 5/10",5.0

In some ways it's a curate's egg of a film. It certainly helps if you are a lover of old classic film and have some knowledge of the source material at the film's core. It's a fabulous concept that the screenplay is based around, that the star of the film may actually be a real vampire, and the whole production is executed with consummate skill (Dafoe was deservedly Oscar nominated as were make-up artists Ann Buchanan & Amber Sibley).

She doesn't exactly look the part, but she has has a voice to die for and suddenly - after a seriously ropey start - their act starts to track a little better. Are things finally on the up? Thus far the film showcases some classy numbers peppered with the odd pithy one-liner and just about enough style to get it by. Now we have our little triumvirate, though, the romantic clutter starts to get in the way; the standard dysfunctional family soap suds start to froth and I just found the whole thing started to drag. Pfeiffer is the star of the show, and her versions of ""More Than You Know"" and ""My Funny Valentine"" are impressive, but the joke had worn far too thin for me by this point and I'd lost interest.

This movie is a lot of trash, fun trash, but trash none the less.  It makes sense that these actors would band together to do a comedic project, but I can't imagine why they did an ""idiot boys club"" trope with a ""gay as comedy"" twist.

I'm not a fan of Amanda Peet (but do watch ""A Lot Like Love"" and ""Brockmire"", oddly both baseball subjects), but she is the best actor in this by about a factor of 10.  She plays a highly intellectual character that just doesn't fit in the same world as these other characters (most likely by design), and even manages to do some action sequences with other people involved without them also doing the action sequences.

While I like Jason Biggs, Amanda Detmer, and R. Lee Ermey, I'm not a Steve Zahn fan, and this is not Jack Black's best work.  Being as the majority of the movie is the latter and Amanda Peet, there is a lot of ""this is kind of annoying"" as opposed to ""this is kind of funny"".

The structural writing is actually good, but the premise and the comedic writing is ludicrous, and it is pretty hit or miss.

I can't recommend it just because there are too many other options: just the number of abuse humor comedies starring Jason Biggs is enough to give you a list of suggestions for other movies.",5.0
10882,"Beautiful Disney Production Of A Wonderful Fairytale.

When an evil witch places a curse on an infant princess that will cause her to fall into eternal sleep on her 16th birthday, her three fairy godmothers whisk her away to a life of normality and ignorance of her birthright. But can they stave off the curse when the 16th year of age arrives?

It upped the ante in costing for Disney, also taking a decade to produce. The ambition was high as new techniques were being used such as rotoscoping, while the musical score is brilliantly devised from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty ballet. The story itself is a pure joy, based on Charles Perrault's ever enduring fairytale, it's awash with rich characters, led by the delightful three fairy godmothers - Flora - Fauna and Merryweather, all plumpy and sweet, while evil witch Maleficent is brilliantly produced, with a long pointy chin and devil horns on her head.

There's a whole bunch of charming fun on show, as the three ladies bring the magic and potter around while gently ribbing each other, but it's with the drama where Sleeping Beauty most soars. The nightmare sequence luring Briar Rose (Princess Aurora) to the dreaded spinning wheel is unnerving, and the battle between Prince Phillip and Maleficent is exhilarating and shows the animators at their best. As for the colour? Spanking!

10885,"A heavy burden.

American remakes of Asian horror films have mostly struggled to win grace and favour with horror fans. Shutter is no exception, it has been met with the usual howls of derision, claims of it being pointless, loosing the horror essence of the original and etc. But what for someone like me who hasn’t seen the original?

I found Shutter to be much like how I found The Ring, the Naomi Watts starrer from 2002, a very effective chiller with a solid mystery to be unravelled at the core. The ghost is creepy – as are the various photographic links, the scares handled professionally by the makers, and the finale pays off with a startlingly chilling revelation that freaked me out; and I’m a middle aged man!

It’s far from perfect, the pace is a bit haphazard, logic goes out the window often, and cast performances are only adequate in the absence of  “A” list stars to propel the story onwards. While it’s tough to hang your hat on the two principal players since the emotional empathy hasn’t been earned by them, courtesy of the writing. Yet with no frame of reference to raise expectation levels – or down them as well, this is a safe and sturdy spooker that does its job well enough. 7/10",7.0
10885,"Shutter takes Polaroid remnants of the original without the stunning flash. This is a peculiar remake. During the towering heights of Hollywood westernising world-renowned Asian horrors, mostly from Japan and South Korea, Japanese director Ochiai opted to alter the story of Thailand’s arguably most famous eponymous horror with American actors, set in Japan. Western audiences apparently wouldn’t be spooked if the ghost haunting the main characters wasn’t a pasty white Japanese girl with luscious black hair and masses amount of eye liner. It’s a cluster of cultures, and whilst the end result isn’t exactly terrible, it’s far from being tolerably good. Because much like ‘The Grudge’, ‘One Missed Call’ and ‘Pulse’, the underlying sense of pointlessness becomes an overburden for everyone involved.

A photographer and his new bride travel to Tokyo where they accidentally smash into a girl standing in the middle of the darkened misty road (bare foot, might I add!). And so, through the ominous power of spirit photography, they become haunted. Specks of mysterious white vapours and the glistening sunlight against the camera lenses, being interpreted as ghostly entities attempting to communicate with the living. “The dead latch onto the flesh”.

Without changing the essence of the overall story too much, just minor details here and there, Ochiai manages to produce various suspenseful moments through the usage of anonymity. The ethereal cries of a haunting girl, the innocent humming of an eerie song and the most intense tonguing since Toad got struck by lightning back in ‘00. The supernatural elements work best when nothing is showed on screen. The dark room sequence when Megumi entered the room, although initially presumed to be Jane, was executed with enough slow-paced tension to become effective. Dropping a splinter of wood into a solution that causes a tsunami into the eyes? Ineffective. Electrocuting one’s self in a desperate attempt to rid the latched ghost? Well, I don’t need to tell you how stupid that is.

Dawson’s script is less than impressive. Masses amount of exposition and one-dimensional development that forced characters to be nothing more than tourists and amateur photographers. Seriously, Jane is the worst tourist. Shouting in the faces of locals exclaiming “excuse me, where do I go!?”. Is she oblivious to native languages? Like, she failed to even attempt one word in Japanese. That’s not Taylor’s fault, who isn’t the most talented actress in existence, but managed to bring out some surprising emotionality towards the film’s conclusion. Jackson on the other hand? Ehhh. He’s the kind of guy you want to slap for acquiring no personality. Just bland. His character’s best friends are pointless and sadly resorted to expendable deaths that suffered from no build-up.

The central mystery that powers the narrative does captivate, even if Ochiai’s direction made certain twists obvious due to extensive foreshadowing, and that’s the primary element for preventing this remake from venturing into the realms that we do not speak of. I’m looking at you ‘One Missed Call’ and ‘Pulse’!

So yes, Shutter is fine. As a film, it functions by itself with enough flash for the uninitiated. However, for those who have watched the original, you’re bound to find disfigurement within the composition of this photographic remake.",4.0

The wonderful, Oscar winning, score is the best in the Disney repertoire and the characterisations are engaging. If it has any flaws: the dialogue - there is too much of it; it is possibly just a little too long and finally - I just didn't really like ""Pinocchio"" much as a little boy - a bit too thoughtless and selfish.

He is going to test the theory with his recently deceased mutt ""Zowie"" and this triggers a course of events that has poor old ""Jeff"" soon contemplating putting his mother in the same ground in the hope that she, too, might come back to life. This is actually quite comical to start with, but as it progresses it becomes little better than a cheap and cheerful zombie movie that is totally devoid of peril and suffers from a some very wooden acting and a very limited special effects budget.

A classic in beautiful Technicolor with iconic fencing scenes, dastardly villains, and the definitive Robin and Marian.

Errol Flynn leads as as the loyal, mischievous outlaw who defies and systematically robs the rich and redistributes to the poor, whilst he awaits the return of the kidnapped King Richard from his prison in Austria. Basil Rathbone, as ""Guy of Gisbourne"" steals this for me; he really does convey a degree of menace and I certainly would rather he had come out on top in the end!! Olivia de Havilland and Claude Rains are brilliant too - as is the underrated Melville Cooper as the hugely incompetent High Sheriff, and Alan Hale who reprises his role as ""Little John"" from the 1922 (Douglas Fairbanks) silent version of this legend.

10910,"Rushing to meet his returning father, the young Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec takes a tumble down their elegant marble staircase and that leaves him with broken legs that will stunt his growth. Struggling to come to terms with his disability, he (José Ferrer) turns to a more Bohemian life in Paris where he makes a decent living as an artist whilst frequenting the world famous ""Moulin Rouge"" where he feels entirely at home amongst the dancers, creative and debauched types. The story here doesn't so much feature on his artistic talents, but more on the two loves of his life. The first is ""Marie"" (Colette Marchand) who makes a living as a lady of the night, and with whom he has at best a rocky sort of relationship. The second is the more sophisticated but troubled ""Myriamme"" (Suzanne Flon). His life is now in a maelstrom of turmoil from which he (or we) can see no obvious path of escape. This is quite a showcase for the on-form Ferrer whose naturally understated style of performing works well here with both Marchand and Flon. The writing is succinct and allows the contrasting nature of his relationships - not just with the women in his life, but with his family too - to develop effectively, if at times a little too slowly. It's Zsa Zsa Gabor who rather let's the side down. I was never quite sure what her talents were - but singing and/or dancing can't really be said to be amongst them as her musical numbers fall pretty flat. Still, the costumier and production designers give a vibrancy and authenticity to the look of this film and Georges Auric goes to town on a score that complements the whole thing in a lively, even stirring, fashion. It's not an history so don't expect any sort of meaningful chronology of the man's life or work - it's more of a soap.

A team of army specialists are assembled with the task of infiltrating a German held Greek island. Then they have to destroy the mighty twin guns up in the hills that blight the British operations on the Aegean waters. 

Adapted from the Alistair MacLean novel, it's directed by J. Lee Thompson and stars Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Quayle, Stanley Baker and James Darren. Music is scored by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Oswald Morris. 

Watching it now it seems oh so very formulaic, but it was rarely the norm back than for war films to always follow this brand of high end adventure staples. The makers take a bunch of men from the various social spectrum and thrust them together for an impossible mission. We have the stiff backed guys with moral reasoning at their core, the rough and tumble men, all face fuzz and machismo seeping from every pore, and a young baby faced youngster blossoming into a man by the day. 

They will be put through the mangler at regular intervals, faced with scenarios to test their metal, all while the group view each other with suspicions of motives and reasonings. Here the character sub-plots, their hang-ups and frets, do not bog down the fun or the excitement, they enhance the narrative. We also get two ladies entering the group (Irene Papas/Gia Scala), and they too add some meat into an already beefy stew. 

Action is a plenty, suspense equally so. While of course there's twists and turns to input some mystery and pot boiling character dynamics. Elsewhere, Tiomkin provides a robust Golden Globe Winning score, and Bill Warrington & Chris Greenham's special effects won the Academy Award in that department - they look at times a bit weak now, but who cares right? The array of screen work, matte paintings and miniatures blend superbly with the outdoor location photography, which points us to a time when film makers worked their socks off to create the magic up there on the screen. Oh and the scripted dialogue is just wonderful and beating an intelligent heart.

10935,"Heaven’s Gate (1980)

Barbed wire and women are the two greatest civilising agents in the world.

Heaven’s Gate is written and directed by Michael Cimino and stars Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Isabelle Huppert, Jeff Bridges, John Hurt and Sam Waterston. Music is by David Mansfield and cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond.
Picture is based around the real-life Johnson County War in 1890 Wyoming, where here we have a Sheriff born into wealth  attempting to protect immigrant farmers from the rich Stockholders Association.

Lets begin by stating that for the clear facts about the financial disaster of Heaven’s Gate, and its impact on studios and film making in general, then research it so I don’t have to write two paragraphs about it. Also it should be known that this is hardly an historically accurate account of the so called Johnson County War (when are big epics ever truly accurate anyway?), so again research pays off there as well.

Heaven’s Gate, the film, was savaged by the critics upon release, especially given that the originally theatrical release they viewed was over an hour shorter than what Cimino intended for release. Thankfully now, if you are a fan or not of the pic, we can at least see the fully formed longer version (three and half hours worth). The charges of self indulgency by Cimino are fair enough, but his vision is clinically focused to the point of producing a potent and meditative (anti) Western epic.

Cimino is in no hurry to tell his story, and rightly so as he gets to grips with character building and methodically slow burning the tensions that led to the Johnson County blood bath. Before we even consider the technical smarts on show, there’s a strong emotional current swirling away in the narrative, an intimacy that’s beguiling and holds those fully invested in the first half of film – in readiness for the pay off in the superb second half. I do wonder just how many of the 1/10 reviewers actually made it to second half? The point when the gang of hired assassins ride over the hill and begin their terror of murder and sexual assault?

Visually (Zsigmond on top form) the pic blends elegiac tones for the hopes and dreams of the immigrants looking for a new life in the new world, with the grainy realism of the financial greed and oppression dished out by wealthy corporate stockholders. Cimino isn’t found wanting for quality of sequence construction either. Pic features community dances, the kind that John Ford himself would be tipping his hat to. Most notably is the immigrants roller derby dance gathering, a delightfully zestful experience showing a community in love with being a community. The main battle section was laughably trashed by a couple of those original critics, it’s a breath taking sequence of events, a thunderous whirl of dust and circular carnage (circles a thematic for Ciminio), “those god damned Romans” indeed.

Flaws? Absolutely, this is far from a flawless picture. The first half hour featuring Averill (Kristofferson) and Irvine’s (Hurt) Harvard Graduation is draggy and could easily have been cut by twenty minutes. Also scratchy is that both actors look way too old for such a scenario. Cast are mostly unfussy (perfectly so), but there’s an itch that although Huppert has simmering qualities for a bordello babe, she’s a touch miscast for the love triangle verve and the genre surrounds. The script sometimes lacks for 1890 chatter, while the screenplay needs the utmost attention or else you could easily lose the thread of things. True also to sadly reflect upon some obvious animal rights issues, thankfully Hollywood has moved on from such things since.

A flawed masterpiece? Yes I think that fits right when revisiting it nearly 40 years after the disaster of its initial release. It’s a lyrical and majestic piece of work, one that has seen its plus column reputation grow as it is re-evaluated by new critics and new age cinema lovers alike. The themes at work, with the debunking of American mythologizing et al, were too close to the knuckle for many back in 1980, but now it stands proud as a bold, beautiful and brutal film. Yes, even with the flaws. 8/10",8.0
10935,"***Cimino’s epic Western about the Johnson County War, unjustly lambasted by critics***

With the government’s blessing, cattle barons in Wyoming circa 1890 hire an army of mercenaries to kill claimed rustlers who, in many cases, are innocent settlers. A marshal born into wealth (Kris Kristofferson) sides with the poor immigrants in Johnson County; in his spare time he romances a French madam (Isabelle Huppert) who’s also pursued by a top enforcer of the stockmen (Christopher Walken). 

“Heaven’s Gate” (1980) is Michael Cimino’s notorious adult-oriented Western that brought down a studio. Cimino’s style is arty with a focus on mundane realism, similar to Francis Ford Coppola. I’m not a fan of Cimino’s previous film, the overrated “The Deer Hunter” (1978), because of the tedious opening hour and the disagreeable focus on Russian Roulette, although  I love his Tarantino-like “Thunderbolt and Lightfoot” (1974). Cimino wisely doesn’t allow the Harvard graduation sequence that opens “Heaven’s Gate” to go on forever like the wedding in “Deer Hunter,” not to mention it has aesthetic merit. 

There are two versions of the film: The premiere New York City cut runs 3 hours, 39 minutes while the edited version that hit theaters five months later is a little over an hour shorter (roughly 2.5 hours). Critics complain that the story makes no sense, but it’s actually really simple with only a handful of main characters. I was never confused about what was happening and I viewed the shorter version. The locations and photography are top-of-the-line. Whether or not you appreciate the story will depend on if you favor Cimino’s arty, mature and realistic style. In any case, everything leads to an action-packed climax.

When the movie was released there was a critical feeding frenzy, but much of the criticisms are disingenuous as critics conveniently jumped on the hate wagon. For instance, there’s the complaint that this is an ugly film due to an industrial pall, including dust and smoke. Actually, the visuals are awesome despite any dust, smoke or fog. Roger Ebert complained that a character in a burning cabin who is convinced that he’s going to die writes a note and signs his full name before breaking out and getting shot, but the real-life person in question kept a journal of his besieging and, in fact, signed it off before dying. Ebert also whined about a gunman breaking into a house and shooting three men who are raping a woman and yet she is unscathed. Actually the guy in question is a marshal by profession and therefore highly skilled at gunmanship. So what’s the problem? Yet another criticism is that the antagonists could’ve easily gotten to the attackers utilizing the armored wagon made of logs by going around or behind, but the settlers would’ve easily shot ’em down if they unwisely did this seeing as how they would’ve been out in the open. Aduh.         

The film was shot in Montana (Kalispell, Glacier National Park, Blackfeet Indian Reservation, etc.) with the Casper, Wyoming, sequence shot in Wallace, Idaho, and the Harvard segment filmed (obviously) in England.

10935,"Has any film undergone the level of critical turnaround afforded HEAVEN'S GATE (1980) since its initial banishment and failure? Nearly four decades removed from the vitriol and scorn heaped upon, not only the film, but the hubris of its director and the perceived wastefulness of an out-of-control production system, what did writer/director Michael Cimino ultimately leave his audience? Well, as with most (but certainly not all) polarizing works of art, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. At 219 minutes, there is certainly dross; unfortunately, the love triangle at the film's heart constitutes a great deal of it. I'll say it outright: The romance aspect is boring. The picture is much more successful when it focuses on the rancher/immigrant conflict. Even prior to that, the first 30 minutes or so are not only absorbing, they're downright dazzlingly written and performed. I find myself searching for Sam Waterston, John Hurt, Christopher Walken, Kris Kristofferson (away from the romance scenes), and Jeff Bridges and sort-of waiting for other elements to pass-by (almost 10 minutes of roller-skating, anyone?). Transamerica's panicked, short-sighted abandonment of United Artists initially burdened this film with a catastrophic reputation which it didn't deserve. Looked at alongside modern cinema, there is something exciting about the risk-it-all ethos which Cimino (and other directors) brought to the table in the heady '70s. Worth seeing at least once; not only for its sprawling, go-for-broke approach, but also for a look at the tail-end of an era of creative freedom in Hollywood which will almost certainly never be seen again.",6.0
10935,"""Averill"" (Kris Kristofferson) is from wealthy stock, a Harvard graduate, and a decent man who takes up a job as a sheriff in rural Wyoming. Most of the town's population have fled persecution and poverty in Europe, and want to start afresh with their families. They are not afraid of hard work, but that doesn't ease the chagrin of the local cattle ranchers who find them little better than fleas to be swatted. ""Averill"" tries to keep order as best he can, but when the landowners band together, convince the Governor of the merits of their expansionist plans and then draft in the support of the US army then it looks like the migrants are in for a bumpy ride. As tensions mount, he encounters school colleague-cum-gunslinger ""Champion"" (Christopher Walken) and their school valedictorian ""Irvine"" (John Hurt) as the battle lines are drawn not just on the field, but for the affections of ""Ella"" (Isabelle Huppert) too. This really lost me pretty much at the start with Kristofferson cutting an unlikely figure at a graduation ceremony presided over by the ""Reverend"" (Joseph Cotton's only, brief, appearence) and entertained by the intellectual and quite sarcastic ""Irvine"" - he really did look like a fish out of water. Thereafter, Michael Cimino just takes far too long to get the story to the sharp end. We get, quickly, the dynamic of conflict and the ambitiousness of the ranchers but are all to often taken on meandering (and sometimes romantic) side-tracks that don't really add much to the story aside from permitting both men to look moodier, meaner and prove how determined each is to get the same gal. It does come alive for the last thirty minutes as the pot finally boils over and loyalties face the ultimate test, and along the way it does convey an occasionally convincing critique on just how the fight for survival amongst those pioneering Americans was brutal, perilous and laced with bigotry and fear - but if you follow the genre in the slightest, then that won't really surprise you. The acting here is competent, nothing more, and it's certainly a great deal grittier than the more sanitised ""How the West Was Won"" (1962) type of adventure, but it laboured it's points too much and often for me. Maybe a (shorter) director's cut might focus the story better? More like the Gate to Hell, really.",6.0

10938,"**Yet another apologetic film about the assumption of homosexuality.**

I've had other occasions to say that I'm not a fan of apologetic and contestatory films. I am not against their existence, there is room for them and cinema is a legitimate form for the expression and defense of political, social or moral agendas, theories and ideas. It's simply not a type of cinema that I really like to consume, not least because it's a niche cinema, that is, that tends to please those who already defend those ideas, in addition to trying to convince us to accept them. This film does precisely that with homosexuality. There are more and more films that talk about the subject, some do it with skill and even a healthy neutrality, which leaves us room to think and doesn't try to teach us the opinions we should have. “Dallas Buyers Club”, “Philadelphia” or even “Milk” are good films about the theme and about people who defended well the sacred right of homosexuals (and of any citizen) to live their sex life without being the target of recriminations, as long as obey the laws like all citizens. This movie is not that good.

The script focuses on two young people from troubled families in the suburbs of London: after refusing to go home, where he suffers aggression, Steven is welcomed by Jamie's mother. The closeness between the two teenagers eventually leads them to become sexually involved, leading to major complications as their relationship becomes increasingly obvious to everyone who lives there. That is, the film is like so many others, except that it is about homosexuals who live in a kind of urban Babylon where crime, alcohol, drugs, sex and the end of moral values grow more easily than weeds. Supposedly, their relationship is the purest and most innocent thing that is born there... or that's what the film tries to convince us. I wouldn't have so many problems with the moral degradation of that social environment if the story was good, but it's not: it's too sugary, melodramatic, it's full of clichés, and it's approached in a dogmatic way, always around prejudice and shame in being homosexual. The film does not deviate from this tone and, using cheap sentimentality, wants to force us to think in a certain way.

Glenn Berry and Scot Neal are two actors I didn't know, and whose careers didn't take off. I don't know where they are today, but I can say that, from what I've seen, they don't seem to be working as actors anymore and haven't achieved any success. Perhaps this is due to the absolute lack of charisma that both suffer from, and that did not help them to sustain their role in this film. Linda Henry is much more effective and competent, even if she cannot save the film. On a technical level, and being an independent film with a limited budget, we can't fault it. The film does a good job with what it has. There just isn't anything that is really notable, or outstanding.",2.0

The lads start to bond and are soon firm friends whose relationship could be starting to burgeon into something more... This film has a distinct charm about it. Sure, maybe it's a wee bit stereotypical at times, but there are strong efforts from Neal, Berry, especially Henry and from Ben Daniels as her love interest ""Tony"" - who appears to be little better than a dope smoking idler initially, but who is actually rather more than that. It addresses issues of brutality, parenthood and pride - but somehow you just know that there is going to be light at the end of the tunnel and by choosing this ostensibly hostile location for the setting, that light becomes all the more potent as our story develops. It's clearly been done on a budget, the production is a bit on the basic side - but this is a story about character - the strengths and depth of it - and it moves along well and quite powerfully for an engaging ninety minutes.",7.0

10952,"New Jack City is convoluted, contrived, and heavy-handed, ending with a caption warning us to “confront the [drug] problem realistically, without empty slogans and promises”. Well, the characters in the movie certainly eschew empty slogans in favor of some of the most memorable catchphrases ever committed to film (“Sit your five-dollar ass down before I make change,” “I want to shoot you so bad, my d*ck's hard,” etc., etc.), but it might be a bit of a stretch to say that they deal with the problem realistically – and it’s actually the little things, such as our old friend the Red Digital Readout, that cast doubt over the proceedings; conversely, the elephant in the room – i.e., the taking over and conversion into a huge crack house of an entire apartment complex – is based on fact (the hardest things to believe are sometimes the most veridical; compare the upside down-flying commercial airplane in Flight).

The script is sometimes platitudinous, sometimes downright nonsensical, but always, as I hinted above, endlessly entertaining and quotable. Similarly, the plot and is underdeveloped but not shallow, and the film overall has its heart in the right place.

This is a vibrant movie, but it's not just for people who like bright colors; NJC knows the importance of looking beyond appearances. A scene of revelatory intertextuality has the antagonists watching Scarface and reaching the conclusion that the only thing Tony Montana ever did wrong was getting “careless.”

And yet, this eye-opening irony is inexplicably lost on rappers like Lil Wayne and Tyga (both of whom have referred to themselves as ‘Young Nino’; don't they remember or care that Nino Brown at one point literally uses a little girl as a human shield?), making them twice as dumb as the people who watch Scarface and leave with the impression that Tony Montana is a role model.

All things considered, NJC is a rather uneven effort whose weaker moments get by on sheer style, reaching a noirish state where what is said and done takes a backseat to how it is said and how it is done – and in that sense Wesley Snipes’s star-making performance (and what should have been a breakthrough role for Chris Rock), supported by a rock-solid (as well as eclectic, ranging from Judd Nelson to Bill Cobbs, who even then was playing the Old Man) ensemble cast and Mario Van Peebles's confident direction, is the glue that holds the film together.",6.0

Directed by Roy Ward Baker, A Night To Remember is adapted by Eric Ambler from the book written by Walter Lord. Though only met with a lukewarm response at the box office on release, the film has since received critical acclaim and is highly regarded by Titanic historians for its accuracy.

The story of the ill fated voyage of the RMS Titanic is here given a first rate telling by Baker and his crew. Kenneth Moore heads up the multiple cast list (there's over 200 speaking parts), but crucially they let the story be the star. This is about that desperate and distressing night, when people of all classes perished due to a number of circumstances. Circumstances that are all fully formed here. They largely stick to the source story, and by using research with actual survivors they have kept it straightforward and factual. There's also no sub-plots to bog it down, there's time spent with the principals of course, but only enough time to hold our interest when disaster strikes and decisions are to be made.

Psychological horror at its finest, Session 9, in the hands of Brad Anderson, pretty much gets everything right in this most skin itching of sub-genres. Like the ghost story splinter of horror, setting is absolutely everything, and few, if any? Horror settings are as imposing or eerie as the one time Danvers State Hospital. Sadly demolished in 2006/7 to make way for an apartment complex (bastard property developers have no respect outside of the purse), the place positively oozes unease throughout the movie. With Anderson choosing to shoot his film on videotape, this further aids the sense of realism and palpable dread, and although it isn't a stretch of the mind to think about some of the misery that played out in reality at Danvers, Anderson and his photographer Briesewitz ensure that it never leaves our conscious. Tone is set from the off as being slow burn, this is perfect as it allows us to get a grasp of the characters, their psychological make ups and narrative worth.

With the Danvers facility proving to be the extra character, all things come together seamlessly to gnaw away at the viewers. It's a devilishly odd thing to say, but as the story and characters are given room to breath, the audience who have immersed themselves in the picture will start to feel claustrophobic, and then for the night time sequences, even achluophobic. It's pitch perfect pacing by Anderson, who prior to unleashing the unnerving finale, has pulled us (and his excellent cast) slowly through a labyrinth of dank corridors, wards, treatment rooms, caged stairwells and a morgue. Even on the outside during daylight hours everything feels bleak, either with characters loomed over by the building, or on a roof chatting while Gothic turrets watch over them menacingly, the ghosts and bitterness of Danvers Hospital exist fully in Anderson's movie.

Story links a tape recording found by Mike (Gevedon) with that of the workers' unfolding plight. The tape tells of 9 sessions with a troubled patient named Mary Hobbes, to say anymore would be spoilerish, but for the record in this writers eyes it's the creepiest tape recording in horrorville. Add in the odd hospital prop such as a lone wheelchair, a hydrotherapy bath or an orbitoclast! Well you get the picture I'm sure. Climax Golden Twins provide a suitably jarring score, where disjointed noises and elongated tonal strains further enhance the pervading disquiet. Picture only falls down slightly with silly plot error involving a furnace, and for some folk the ending will inevitably be met with dissatisfaction. I liked it plenty but I also feel they could have gone another way with it. But it does work well and isn't a cop out, and certainly it's better than the alternate ending available in the extras section of home disc formats.

10973,"Creature from the Black Lagoon is a fairly straight-forward horror film, but even sixty-five years later, it still works. 

The movie plays on the fear of the unknown creature. Deep in the Amazon Rainforest, there might be some kind of ancient, half-fish-half-man horror that sets out to kill all humans who come into its territory. Maybe it even wants to steal away the women to continue living. That's a scary thought, in and of itself.

When you add that to the movie's best quality, the score, it makes for some truly chilling, truly tense scenes. The whole film is well done, especially for 1954. The set design is fully believable, and the acting is solid all around. Julie Adams specifically does a great job. Even gill-man's costume was relatively well done, especially for the time.",7.0
10973,"We didn't come here to fight monsters, we're not equipped for it.

Out of Universal Pictures, Creature from the Black Lagoon is directed by Jack Arnold, and stars Richard Carlson, Julia Adams, Richard Denning, Antonio Moreno, and Whit Bissell. The eponymous creature was played by Ben Chapman on land and Ricou Browning for the underwater scenes. The cinematography is by William E. Snyder and the score is composed by a trio of men, Henry Mancini, Hans J. Salter & Herman Stein. The story sees a scientific expedition at the top end of the Amazon encounter a Devonian Period amphibious creature. As the creature starts to defend its turf by attacking members of the expedition, in fighting begins to take a hold as the men argue about the best course of action to take. Should it be killed, or should it be captured for scientific research? Either way they need to act fast as the creature has taken a fancy to Kay, the sole female member of the expedition group.

One of the better creature features that surfaced in the 1950s, Creature from the Black Lagoon was one of the film's made as part of the 3D craze that filtered out of Hollywood in 53 & 54. However, unlike many of those film's that were made in the format over those two years, this one has rightly managed to break away from its gimmicky beginnings to become regarded as a genre classic. There are many reasons why it is still well regarded and taken in appreciatively by newcomers.

The story of course is nothing new, the old ""beauty & the beast"" theme can be traced back to the daddy himself, ""King Kong"". But much like Kong, Arnold's movie thrives within the endearing story by getting the audience to sympathise with the titular creature. He is after all only defending his territory, he was happy wallowing down in the depths, remaining undiscovered for many a moon. That he is fascinated by the considerable beauty of Kay Lawrence (Adams sexy and gorgeous), is no crime either. The amount of sympathy garnered for ""Gill-Man"" is helped enormously by the illogical actions of the humans; who in turn go diving and swimming where legend has it men get eaten! This coupled with their bickering about pro science or trophy hunting makes it easy to side with the amphibious one.

It also helps that the film is pretty brisk and only runs for 80 minutes, there's no sags or pointless filler. Too many similar film's of its ilk labour until the monster shows up and all hell then breaks loose. But under Arnold's (It Came From Outer Space/The Incredible Shrinking Man) astute direction, atmosphere and unease is built up by ominous talk and sightings of the Black Lagoon-and only initial glimpses of the creature's scaly webbed claw; accompanied by the attention grabbing theme music. And when the creature finally reveals itself it doesn't disappoint for its an impressive creation. A half-man/half-fish creature covered in scales, resplendent with gills and with cold, dark featureless eyes. It also has great characteristics with a distinctive swimming style in the water, and a lumbering Frankenstein thing going on when on the land. A definitive monster that would be merchandised for ever after.

There's also technical accomplishments away from the creature itself, notably with the memorable underwater photography by Snyder, who uses a portable camera to flow with the swimming sequences, while his shadow and light work down in the depths is memorably mood enhancing. The three tiered score is also one of the best to feature in a ""B"" movie schlocker, three different composers, three different emotional strands; nice. Then there's of course the definitive sequence, the sexy underwater flirting as ""Gill-Man"" swims below the shapely form of Kay, beguiled by her, it's love at first sight. He's not the only one beguiled, we all are, as was Steven Spileberg, who would homage the more dramatic part of the sequence in his opening for Jaws 21 years later. Whilst last but not least it should be mentioned that there are little asides to ecological issues in the piece, something Arnold was want to do. Two sequels would follow, Arnold would return for ""Revenge Of The Creature"" in 1955 and then the John Sherwood directed ""The Creature Walks Among Us"" would round off the trilogy in 1956.

It's the original that still holds up today. 8/10",8.0
10973,"<em>'Creature from the Black Lagoon'</em> is an entertaining flick from 1954.

For a film made so long ago, it really does age nicely. Sure some of the ways used to bring the creature to life look a little dorky in patches, but for the most part I felt the required creepiness - especially via the creature's face. It has the feel of a very well made production, which is little surprise given it's a Universal production of course. I also like how it has a sense of knowledge to it, who knows if it all adds up but it sounds the part at least.

I enjoyed the cast, they all work well together onscreen. Richard Carlson, Julie Adams and Richard Denning are naturally the standouts, though I also found Nestor Paiva to be decent. Interesting to note that two people played the Gillman, with Ben Chapman on land and Ricou Browning underwater.

10982,"> High quality narration, low standard production! Yet wins fairly.

I'm shocked, this is not a Disney's or the Pixer's, not even DreamWorks' or the Sony's, but a very good film. I meant only the story, though the animation was outdated, even for a film from the 2005. I had trouble watching it in the initial parts, because of the poor technical quality. Once the flashback began, I totally hooked to it and forgot the production standard. The film was saved because of the very good story.

You know retelling the same old tale is so old fashioned, telling a tale in the different angles and adding more flavour to it is the new thing. Like for example the recent 'Maleficent'. So other than those all the awesome qualities, the film is more a television type. But very enjoyable by all.

It has been a decade since it came out and I never tried it because someone told me that it's very bad, but I regret for believing that and ditching it. So believe me it is a wonderful film, except it's not a top notch presentation. It is too short and well worth spending your 80 minutes for it. There's a sequel to it, so I want to try it as well and let you know how it is in another review under that title.

In the San Francisco area, five girls in 6th Grade reject a boy’s polite offer to dance with one of them falsely accusing him of assaulting her. Thirteen years later, when they’re all about 25 years-old, the women start receiving macabre valentines before their gruesome deaths. Who’s killing them and why?

""Valentine"" (2001) was made by the director of “Urban Legend” (1998), which gives you an idea of what to expect. Like “Urban Legend” and the overrated “Scream” (1996), there’s a wink of parody, but it’s done better and is actually amusing, not to mention disappears by the second half. 

Unlike those flicks, “Valentine” wasn’t successful at the box office, but I like it better. Sure, it’s a standard slasher with the tropes thereof, but I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It’s similar in tone to “April Fool’s Day” (2008), just superior. 

The notable female cast includes: Marley Shelton (Kate), Jessica Capshaw (Dorothy), Katherine Heigl (Shelley), Jessica Cauffiel (Lily), Denise Richards (Paige) and Hedy Burress (Ruthie). On the other side of the gender spectrum there’s David Boreanaz (Adam), Fulvio Cecere (Detective Vaugn) and Daniel Cosgrove (Campbell).

Six years after Michael Myers previously terrorized Haddonfield, Illinois, ‘the Shape’ returns in pursuit of his niece, Jamie Lloyd, who has escaped some shadowy Druid cult with her newborn. Marianne Hagan and Paul Rudd play the main protagonists while Donald Pleasence returns for his last portrayal of Dr. Loomis. Mitchell Ryan and Kim Darby are also on hand. 

“Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995) is also known as “Halloween 6,” but it’s actually only the fifth movie featuring Michael Myers seeing as how “Halloween 3: Season of the Witch” (1982) is totally disconnected from the Michael Myers story arc.

I’m a fan of “Halloween 4” (1988) and “Halloween 5” (1989), especially the former, as it was actually better than the original movie (1978) and is one of the finest examples of 80’s slashers. Naturally I was expecting a quality sequel but, wow, this installment lacked any sense of cinematic finesse whatsoever.

The entire opening act is a tortuous mess and the story didn't even start to get interesting until past the 50-minute mark. Unfortunately, it failed to build on what little interest it mustered, trading it in for conventional horror thrills at a hospital à la “Halloween 2” (1981). But the characters are too weakly developed to care about; it’s like the ‘writer’ had no concept of how to establish characters or even tell a compelling story. Meanwhile the sudden-shock scares that kept surfacing were eye-rolling hackneyed and anything but scary.

Mulholland Falls is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Pete Dexter. It stars Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Melanie Griffith, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Jennifer Connelly, Treat Williams, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and Andrew McCarthy. Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler.

1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues...

It's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart.

It starts of so well, based on the infamous ""Hat Squad"" we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly.

As the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on.

It all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the ""big"" face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It's not an awful movie, but it is a very disappointing one. A film where a bit more thought given by the producers could have yielded so much more. 5/10",5.0

The detectives aren't really hard boiled, not even Madison who always seems to be hard boiled. The detectives also never really get around to doing much detecting.

It doesn't take long before they are having a fairly torrid affair, but things are difficult. He is older and a Chinese citizen, she a French girl in what was then French Indo-China. She is also a bit of a gold-digger and quite aware that if she plays her cards right, he can offer her a new, more prosperous, life than that she shares with her mother (Fréderique Meininger) and two brothers. The older brother (Arnaud Giovaninetti) is a bit puritanical when it comes to his sister, her younger (Melvil Poupaud) is more shy and usually content to keep his head down and play his piano. Despite the initially venal nature of her relationship, there gradually develops a bond that is both loving and turbulent as the political situation overtakes their love, with the French leaving Vietnam to local government. This is a well scored and stunning looking film but the story is remarkably thin and repetitive and once we've seen them have sex a few times, I began to wonder if Jean-Jacques Annaud was just a bit bereft of ideas as to how to develop either character beyond the physical or material. It's a slow burn and I'm afraid that I just didn't really engage with either as the story trundled along, narrated occasionally and rather melodramatically by Jeanne Moreau, to a conclusion that was quite a long time coming and not really worth the wait. It's watchable, and illustrates well the gap between rich and poor here in the 1920s, but is very much an example of style over substance.",6.0
10997,"**An excellent film.**

I was really curious to see this movie, because as far as I can remember it was the first Chinese movie I saw. Before I saw it, I read a little about it, and I was quite impressed to see how the film did well in the West, and managed to infuriate Chinese Communist censors. However, I fear that I was not fully prepared for what awaited me.

In fact, the film is truly brutal, in every sense of the word. Director Kaige Chen took a well-known and respected book for his film, but put all the focus on an almost visceral realism. The film is an epic that spans a large period of time, between 1924 and 1977, that is, very troubled years in Chinese history, which includes the entire period of war against Japan and the invasion of Manchuria, as well as the cultural revolution. Maoist.

At the same time, it reveals the backstage of Cantonese opera, a traditional Chinese cultural style. In the film, two young apprentices live a cruel and unhappy life at the opera school, with daily beatings and various abuses, including sexual abuse. One of them will play the female characters in the stories, like a transvestite, since women are not allowed on stage. Throughout the film, there is a lot of confusion between life and art, and we often feel that these actors are mixing things up, living their characters in real life and transposing their real life to the stage.

I don't know any of the actors in the cast, but I really liked their overall work, and the way they play opposite each other. The film also has extraordinary scenarios, full of realistic details, such as the construction of buildings, the lanterns. The actors' costumes also deserve applause, especially the characters in the opera, with all those fabrics and those strong face paints. Finally, a word for the wonderful cinematography, excellent opening credits and soundtrack.",8.0

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Seemingly happily married man, Dan Gallagher, gives in to the seductive charm of Alex Forrest and partakes in a night of wild sexual passion with her. Trouble is, is that Alex is a tad unhinged and a woman scorned can be the ultimate nightmare.

I have just revisited this monster smash hit from the 80s (highest grossing film of 1987), and it still packs the same punch as it did back in the late 80s when it not only became a big hit, it also became a cultural phenomenon and one of the most talked about films of the decade. I'm saddened by the relatively average rating here because its significance and bravery should always be highlighted instead of pointless allegations about it being only of its time. Just how many imitations did Fatal Attraction spawn I wonder? Fatal Attraction was a monster hit because it gave the audience something different, a monster flip flop of having the man stalked by an uncontrollable female loony. Much credit goes to screenwriter James Dearden for laying it on like a slowly tightening spring waiting to explode, for as the plot unfolds and Alex Forrest's Madame Butterfly fuelled revenge gathers apace, the audience starts to realise it has been doubly conflicted on the emotional character attachment front.

Dan has done the dirty on his beautiful wife and child, the bastard deserves what is coming to him for sure? Alex is right in that he's had his fun and now she can basically go and whistle at the moon, but the cheeky saver here from the makers is that Alex did the chasing knowing that Dan was happily married, she led the way fully armed with the facts. This makes for a wonderfully constructed thriller that ups the suspense quota to positively seal the deal with a heart stopping finale. I'm mightily relieved that American test audiences gave the thumbs down to the rather downbeat original ending that saw Alex committing suicide and thus framing Dan for her murder, the ending that stands may lose impact on repeat viewings, but boy it has still got a kick to it.

Glenn Close is fantastic as Alex, playing against type she manages to convince as a disturbed individual, a perfect blend of sadness and soul destroying stupidness. Michael Douglas is also giving a performance of depth, firmly in the shadow of Glen Close's film stealing show, he none the less plays it perfectly and is believable in all aspects of the character, and I'm sure the ladies watching were pleased to see no sign of the saggy bottom that scared them in Basic Instinct five years later! This film coupled with Wall Street in the same year would propel Douglas to major A list status, and he rightly deserved it in my opinion. Anne Archer is Beth Gallagher, the hurt wife of the piece, she looks stunning and sexy, but thoughts of her looks are quickly erased with a special two layered performance of note. Containing a great script and directed astutely by Adrian Lyne, Fatal Attraction remains one of the best thrillers of the 80s, it was talked about profusely back then, and here and now it should not be forgotten. 9/10",9.0

11002,"John, John, John of the jungle.

Upon release mixed notices greeted this attempt to get to the crux of Edgar Rice Burroughs' jungle man creation, The Lord of the Apes, Tarzan. It's a bold movie in many ways, one of those occasions when a fondly thought of character from days of yore is given the serious make - over treatment. Which as film history tells us is often very tricky.

Plot trajectory has a lost child of the British aristocracy reared by apes in the African jungle after his parents were shipwrecked there. Feral but wonderfully skilled with it, the child becomes a feral man of some substance, but when he is discovered by explorers he is taken to Britain and his ancestral home. Lord Greystoke becomes his title, but his loyalties, confusion and emotions continue to pull him in two directions.

The story as written obviously becomes a two-parter. The first part is the best as Greystoke is born into the jungle and we are up close and personal with the ape community. The action is very well marshalled, the effects work of a high quality, and the realisation of the situational dynamics is superb. Not forgetting, either, some mighty emotional thumps as the dangers of mother nature's creatures tugs away at the old heart strings, the rules and brutality of the jungle given weighty filmic thrust.

Shifting gear to the ""jungle man in aristocracy Britain"" thread, the pace slows down considerably as Greystoke dons a tux and gets the hots for Miss Jane Potter. It's this section of film that proves problematic. Narrative is bogged down by philosophical brain farts, further compounded by Andie MacDowell's (Jane) voice being dubbed by Glenn Close and the fake noises coming out of Christopher Lambert's (Greystoke) mouth, they are both very disconcerting issues. Thankfully Ralph Richardson (in his last film before he passed away) is on hand as Grandfather Greystoke to give the pic a warm and tender center.

Tech credits are a mixed bag, with John Alcott's photography impressive on both continents and Rick Baker & Paul Engelen's makeup work is from the high end. Sadly, John Scott's musical score is not nearly epic enough, while director Hugh Hudson is guilty as charged when it comes to not keeping seamless the transitional change over from jungle to mainland, more so as the great Ian Holm gets short shrift here. What a waste!

Meantime, his protégé is having a few issues of his own - not least because he accidentally shot the principal's dog and he is the object of the amorous attentions of the ambisextrous ""Terry"" too! There's quite a decent dynamic between Douglas and Maguire as both men have to come to terms with their own problems and with their growing reliance on and frustration of each other and there is plenty of witty dialogue that is more complexly structured and subtly potent at times. The narrative is quite tightly packed into just one weekend, and that helps keeps the momentum going as the characters develop in quite a plausible - and not always likeable - fashion. Luckily, the one-dimensional Katie Holmes appears only sparingly as the plot thickens to a nicely bubbling stew at the end. It's a decent reminder that Douglas could act, given a strong story and script, and he shows us that well here with this superior ensemble drama.",7.0
11005,"***A ‘hospital film’ with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, based on a true story***

A shy doctor (Robin Williams) gets a job at a Bronx hospital in 1969 where he attends to several patients in a catatonic state after the encephalitis epidemic of 1917–28. He experiments with a new drug that offers the hope of reviving them. Robert De Niro plays his key patient, Julie Kavner his nurse and John Heard his supervisor. Penelope Ann Miller is also on hand as a potential romantic interest.

""Awakenings” (1990) is based on Oliver Sacks' 1973 memoir of the same name, which chronicled the true event that occurred the summer of ’69. Being a hospital movie about ailing people trying to recover puts it in the same camp as “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” (1975) and “Instinct” (1999), but it’s not as compelling. 

There’s just not enough human interest beyond the viewer being sympathetic toward the patients’ plight and wanting them to get well. It’s also marred by some blatant predictableness, like Leonard’s name on the bench and the “cup of coffee” aspect. Still, this is a tale that needed to be told and I’m not sorry I watched it. It’s just overrated.  

The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, New York City.

Smokey and the Bandit is directed by Hal Needham and the screenplay is collectively written by James Lee Barrett, Charles Shyer and Alan Mandel; from a story by Needham and Robert L. Levy. It stars Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed and Mike Henry. Music is by Bill Justis and Jerry Reed and cinematography by Bobby Byrne.

He does what he does best-shows off.

Bo ""Bandit"" Darville (Reynolds) accepts a, illegal job/bet offer of delivering a truck load of Coors Beer from Texas across the states to Georgia. The job must be completed within 28 hours or he will not pick up the $80,000 payment for his services. Enlisting his buddy Snowman (Reed) to drive the truck, while he acts as a decoy in his Pontiac Trans Am, the Bandit must avoid capture by the Smokey (police). When he stops to pick up runaway bride Carrie (Fields), this makes him the target for one particularly vindictive laws enforcer, Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Gleason), whose son Junior Justice (Henry) is the jilted intended of Carrie.

You sumbitches couldn't close an umbrella!

The best of the ""CB Radio"" movies, Smokey and the Bandit makes up for what little it has in plot, with unadulterated fun via car pursuits, stunts and wonderfully colourful characters. Essentially one long chase movie, it was a massive box office success on it release, becoming the second biggest earner in 77 behind a certain Space Opera from George Lucas. Cashing in on Burt Reynolds popularity, and the new found interest in CB radio on the highways, film went on to influence similar films and TV shows further down the line. The memory of the poor sequels and the inferior similar films of its type has somewhat led to many people forgetting just what an entertaining movie it is.

There is no way, no way, that you could come from my loins. Soon as I get home, first thing I'm gonna do is punch your momma in the mouth.

Hal Needham uses his knowledge as an ex-stuntman to great effect, setting up a number of inspired sequences that sees cars jumping, crashing or going for a swim! Wisely letting his actors ad-lib where possible, film has a natural flow that's hard to dislike. The chemistry between Reynolds and Fields is warming, due to the fact that it was off screen real, while Gleason steals the movie with a hilarious portray as the manic, cussing and determined Buford. The bumpkin based music is perfectly in keeping with the mood, and the various locations used make for an appealing backdrop to the carnage and speedster thrills.

11009,"Great snapshot of the disco era with compelling characters and story 

RELEASED IN 1977 and directed by John Badham, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a drama/musical detailing events in Brooklyn where a group of Italian-American youths led by Tony Manero (John Travolta) work dead-end jobs, rumble with Hispanics and meet babes at the local discothèque where Tony is a champion dancer. Donna Pescow plays his needy wannabe girlfriend while Karen Lynn Gorney plays his dance partner for a big contest. 

This was a huge hit in its day and the catalyst for disco fever throughout the world. To this day you’ll see people mimic Travolta’s iconic dance stance with one arm pointing upward and the corresponding leg out. John was in the prime of his life at 22 during shooting (a great inspiration for guys to get in shape) and already popular due to TV’s Welcome Back Kotter. “Saturday Night Fever” shot him to stardom, making him a household name. 

The movie’s hit status was deserved because of its emphasis on the ordinary, but interesting protagonists and their entertaining drama, not to mention the dynamic dance sequences and popular soundtrack featuring the Bee Gees. There are several quality scenes, including one with the magnificent Brooklyn Bridge as a backdrop. Watch for 19 year-old Fran Drescher making her acting debut in a glorified cameo.

11009,"I was but ten years old when this was released, so never saw it at the cinema at the time - but boy was it big news. John Travolta was fêted all around the world as the white-suited hipster ""Tony Manero"" who almost glided around the city streets - and the dance floor. Determined to improve his lot, he enters a disco competition which he thinks will change his life and what ensues for about two hours is his story. Sadly, it's not much of a story. He's not a very engaging fellow; treats women badly, has a mouth on him that could strip paint and is constantly at loggerheads with his hard working, decent, old man. Things take a turn for the more complicated when the apple of everyone's eye - his priest brother ""Frank"" (Martin Shakar) returns home announcing his intention to give up the priesthood for a life that doesn't require celibacy. Luckily, ""Tony"" teams up on the dance floor with the spunky ""Stephanie"" (Karen Lynn Gorney) - a woman even more ambitious for a clean start than him - and that is where the film eventually takes off. On the dance floor, with the disco ball working it's magic and a collection of superb Bee Gees tracks that cannot fail to get your toes tapping. ""Night Fever""; ""Staying Alive""; If I Can't Have You"" and the more slow tempo'd ""How Deep Is Your Love"" make the soundtrack way, way, more memorable than this otherwise tawdry, tacky look at life in New York in the mid 1970s. Travolta is the star, his walk and his cocky style stand him apart from the rest of this rather depressingly anodyne story - but in the end it's a film about aspiration, dancing and the Bee Gees, and the latter elements are well worth watching.",6.0
11010,"**A beautiful Italian production.**

If there is something that manages to cause serious expression problems in the most flirtatious and fluent of men, it is the ardent gaze of the girl he loves. I know this from experience, and any man who has been in love, at least once, knows that it is not easy to choose the right moment and the right words to express the greatness and beauty of feelings. Things get worse, of course, if the man is shy or less experienced in Cupid's dealings. Then, yes, things get really complicated!

Contrary to what the film might make us think, it is not necessary to be a poet to tell a beautiful woman that we love her. Well, from the little that has happened to me, what often happens is that love itself transforms us into incidental, fortuitous poets. And if the first verses are given to us by the gods, the muse of our affection easily inspires the rest. And that's how poetry is made: through the adventures and misfortunes of the heart of those who write it!

This Italian production tackles these questions by facing two characters who, otherwise, might never meet: one is Mario Ruoppolo, a former fisherman who became a postman because he doesn't get along with seasickness, and who feels not being able to express how he feels about the girl he is in love with; the other is the famous Chilean communist poet Pablo Neruda, famous for his socialist verbiage and for the romantic sonnets that earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature. The contrast could not be greater: the simplicity and natural shyness of the popular man and the expressiveness and charisma of a consecrated public figure. And if one has ascendancy over the other, I cannot say that the popular man seems to have had great importance for the public figure, despite the fact that the film tries to instill it.

Massimo Troisi, in addition to assisting director Michael Redford, brilliantly secures the lead role, giving Ruoppolo a balanced dose of modesty, shyness and curiosity. The only negative criticism I can make of him is the way he fades and darkens whenever he has to play with Neruda, well played by Philippe Noiret. However, it cannot be denied that the best parts of the film are the dialogues and scenes in which both are together. And in fact, the dialogues deserve a special note, for the quality and the way they were done. Renato Scarpa is irritating due to the excessive politicization of his character, which is as tiresome and repetitive as the political discourse of most communist and socialist politicians. If we listen to one in a single speech, we listen to them all in everything they might want to say. Despite not appearing much and not really having much to do, Maria Grazia Cucinotta is a welcome addition to the plot, as well as being magnificent and so beautiful that any man in the street would turn his head to admire her for longer (something that happens much to the ragazze of Italy, on account of the great merit of their beauty).

Technically, the film has some merits: if the cinematography is not particularly remarkable and looks misty and aged, the scenic beauty of the filming locations and the film's sets compensates for them, with plenty of room and with an abundance of light, sun, sea, magnificent outdoor scenes and truly breathtaking landscapes. The melody also deserves a frankly positive note: in addition to fitting harmoniously with the film and each scene, it is beautiful, very well conceived and stays in the ear.",9.0
11010,"With things unstable in his native Chile, renowned poet ""Neruda"" (Philippe Noiret) takes refuge on a small Italian island where his arrival is greeted with little more than a realisation that they are going to need to hire an extra postman! Step forward ""Mario"" (Massimo Troisi). He can barely read or write but is determined to engage the visitor in conversation and to learn from him. Initially indifferent, ""Neruda"" begins to converse with him as he delivers the daily post and when he declares he needs some help to woo the charming ""Beatrice"" (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), he finds himself with a new mentor. Now it's fair to say that his first attempts are maybe just a little too rough and ready. Too many references to the shapeliness of her breasts and such like, but gradually ""Mario"" learns how to express himself more fully, more characterfully, and less earthily too. This education also opens his eyes to what has been going on around him for years. His island doesn't even have running water and with elections looming, he finds himself drawn to a communist cause as he watches the visiting politicians make promises he knows will never be delivered. His new found political awareness doesn't always go down so well with his compatriots who just want to get on with their simple, maritime, lives. This adaptation of Antonio Skármeta's book really does imbue the characters with a generous spirit and loads of charisma. It's all understated, and the evolution of ""Mario"" is really well handled by Troisi who sort of co-directed with Michael Radford and with a delicately honest effort from Noiret too. The cinematography benefits hugely from the natural island scenario which at times seems to mirror the emotions being played out by the people. This is also quite an effective analysis of what constitutes poetry itself. The subtlety of the structure of the words that don't rely on the all-too-familiar rhymes is used to good effect. Another film that befits hugely from a cinema screen to enjoy the brightness and Luis Bacalov score and is really worth a watch.",7.0

RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Steven Shainberg, ""Secretary"" is a romantic dramedy about a young woman (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who spent some time at a mental hospital for self-harm (e.g. cutting). She apprehends a job as a secretary to a quirky, arduous lawyer (James Spader) wherein their employer-employee bond turns increasingly sexual in a dominant/submissive way.

This is the first mainline film in America to breach the difficult topic of BDSM, walking the balance beam between being either too amusing or too offensive. For those not in the know, BDSM is an overlap of acronyms: BD stands for Bondage and Discipline; DS for Dominance and Submission; and SM for Sadism and Masochism. I didn’t really know the movie tackled BDSM before viewing it; I thought it was simply a romance-in-the-office type flick with maybe some kinky elements. 

The movie is polarizing, unsurprisingly. I read a few reviews by respectable critics and one was fascinated by it, giving it an incredible 10/10 Stars (Why Sure!), while another wrote it off as a film for sick people, granting it 1/10 Stars. Whilst I find the romance-at-the-office element interesting, I could care less about the BDSM angle. Regardless, the first half is amusing enough and Maggie is a winsome treat, but the second half gets a little too deviant and borders on porn. 

Yet the movie ends well with a well-intentioned message: This is a story about two people who have an affinity for DS that find each other and their relationship may or may not work (no spoilers). I suppose the movie is trying to get across that pain can be therapeutic as long as it's applied by the right hand with the right intention. Thus two people with an affinity for BDSM can develop a relationship that works, for them. But not me; no thanks.

11015,"Pot's a misdemeanour. Decapitation seems a bit severe.

The Relic is directed by Peter Hyams (also cinematographer) and based on the best-selling novel written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. The film stars Tom Sizemore, Penelope Ann Miller, James Whitmore and Linda Hunt. The music score is composed by John Debney. 

The Museum of Natural History in Chicago takes delivery of some crates from South America. Sent by an employee, John Whitney, one of the crates appears to be just full of leaves. However, just as the museum prepares to launch a major exhibition, where all the city's top brass will be present, a security guard is horrifically killed. Can superstitious cop Lt. Vincent D'Agosta (Sizemore) and evolutionary biologist Dr. Margo Green (Miller) get to the bottom of the mystery before it's too late?

From the bunch of creature feature movies that surfaced in the 1990s, The Relic may not win prizes for originality of plotting, but it scores high for tension and gloopy fun. Though the decent budget is evident ($70,000,000), the film has all the old fashioned values to make a creature feature work. Rank and file staples come thick and fast; boo jump moments, characters refusing to accept the un-normal, silly kids, silly coppers, a potential hero and heroine, possible romance, some sci-fi babble, a curse, and of course the creature itself - a big hybrid of god knows what! with the ""Kothoga"" being a snarling, slimy monstrosity that goes about the museum lopping heads off some inept human beings with carefree abandon. What's not to like there?

Though Hyams is no genius director, he is, as his CV suggests, more than capable at crafting a polished movie. Such is the case here, where the ""B"" movie story is given good technical treatment. The lighting (you may have to adjust your settings here) and editing serve the atmosphere well, while the sound work is of the required horror requisitional standard. More importantly, though, Hyams is aware of building up the tension by not unleashing the creature far too soon. We know it's the killer, and we get little snippets of it here and there, but it's not until all hell breaks loose at the big museum event that we get to see the monster, and it's not a let down. Part animatronic/part computer effect, the ""Kothoga"" is original and it is scarily great fun. So much so it (thankfully) steers the viewers away from the pedestrian performances of the cast. Not bad exactly, but just doing grizzled and spunky beauty (Sizemore & Miller respectively) doesn't really grab the attention. The best actor on show is Whitmore (tracing a lovely creature feature line from Them! in 1954 to here), but he is badly under written and under used.

Frank McCloud is in the Florida Keys to visit the widow and father in law of an old war buddy, whilst at the hotel they run, he finds it has been taken over by gangster Johnny Rocco and his thugs.

The cast, the performances, the screenplay, tight direction, the photography and on it goes to give us a bona fide entry into 1940s classics. It never ceases to amaze me how well Key Largo stands up on repeat viewings, each viewing bringing something new to my ever keen eye. This latest viewing brought me abundant joy in observing the background acting of the supporting players, not one of them looking on waiting for the director to shout CUT, each adding greatly with intense facial mannerisms - check out some of the background stuff Thomas Gomez does for example. Ah intense, what a truly befitting word to use as regards John Huston's direction here, perfectly capturing the stifling heat of Largo and coupling it with the sweltering tension inside this run down hotel.

Key Largo is often thought of as the lesser film from the Bogart/Bacall production line, which in fairness is against some pretty special opposition. Maybe we do lose the sexual chemistry of the mighty duo here? but in its place is a mano-mano face off teetering on the brink of explosion, Edward G Robinson's weasel Rocco in danger of becoming a loose cannon to McCloud's staid drifter, the atmosphere is palpable as this room full of hate and mistrust starts bubbling towards boiling point.

Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor (Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actress), Thomas Gomez and Harry Lewis are all excellent, all benefiting from master director Huston molding them together. Whilst Karl Freund's deep focus photography perfectly encapsulates the mood of the piece.

When the students & staff of a girl’s school outside Melbourne take an outing to Hanging Rock on Valentine’s Day in 1900, three girls and a teacher mysteriously go missing. What happened to them?  

Directed by Peter Weir and based on the 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, “Picnic at Hanging Rock” (1975) is an artsy psychological mystery that seems timeless. The style is akin to movies like “Days of Heaven” (1978), “The Secret Garden” (1993) and “The Virgin Suicides” (1999). If you like those movies you’ll appreciate this one. While not as compelling as Weir’s future “Dead Poets Society” (1989), there are some obvious parallels. Both movies deal with prep schools that represent the curious constraints of civilization; you play the game to survive and the only way to escape is through some kind of exile.

The first act is artistic, but rather dull with an increasing sense of foreboding. Things pick up during the haunting outing at Hanging Rock. Once the females go missing the movie becomes compelling because the viewer WANTS to know what happened. The fun of the movie is to speculate on the clues and come to a probable conclusion, as well as look for symbolic meaning.

I should add that I own the “The Secret of Hanging Rock,” published in 1987, which contains Lindsay’s supposedly missing 18th chapter. I strongly believe this was a scam by the publisher to sell more books after the author’s death due to the increasing interest in the story via the movie’s international success. There is zero factual evidence of this apocryphal 'last chapter' containing the 'explanation' to the original book. Lindsay had repeatedly stated that she did NOT write any solution and purposefully left the story a mystery, fiercely advocating the open-endedness of her tale. It doesn’t help that this curiously brief ‘last chapter’ doesn’t fit the style & content of the original novel; it’s awkwardly blunt with its peculiar ‘explanation.’ Still, it is ONE of the possible answers and certainly adds to the interesting mystery.

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, with another version running about 8 minutes longer. It was shot at Hanging Rock in the state of Victoria, about a 50-minute drive northwest of Melbourne in southeast Australia; the Appleyard College sequences were shot at Martindale Hall near Mintaro in South Australia, about a 7-hour drive northwest of Hanging Rock. Other scenes were shot in the studio at Adelaide, which is about an hour drive south of Martindale Hall.

Then to sea and the film becomes a standard series of maritime melodramas with loads of treachery, adultery and for many the impending iceberg may well have been welcome! The concluding scenes are actually quite tensely handled by Herbert Selpin but the exaggerated characterisations and clearly expressed anti-British sentiment, as well as scant attention to the known facts - even in 1943 - render the thing little better than a piece of clumsy propaganda that played a bit fast and loose with some real historical figures.

I picked this one out on a whim on Prime Video, having known absolutely zilch about it... even after I checked a few minor things about it (checking to see if it has a sequel or whatever, as I do for any film I watch) I was expecting a simple, cliché teen story. I did catch a glimpse of one of Prime's images for it and it looked dramatic, but I just imagined it was the character's overreaction to getting dumped or something silly like that. It wasn't!

Even so, across the opening chunk of the movie I was still anticipating the aforementioned. Yet, from just prior to the midway point really, things get deeper by the minute - not long later, I was genuinely hooked. It's a great film. I guess that's why you don't judge a book by its cover and all that, and why I don't read about flicks before watching them - I love being surprised!

The performances are truly excellent, none more so than that of Evan Rachel Wood - superb!

11028,"**_Good ol’ boys on the take in New Orleans with Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin_**

A new DA assistant (Barkin) arrives in town and zeroes-in on corruption in the force. While the head detective (Quaid) cozies up to her, they try to solve a curious mob-oriented slaying. Ned Beatty, John Goodman, Lisa Jane Persky and Ebbe Roe Smith are on hand as members in the agency. 

""The Big Easy"" (1987) has the office camaraderie of Burt Reynolds’ “Fuzz” from fourteen years prior meshed with the milieu and more serious tone of “Cat People,” Eastwood’s “Tightrope” and Gere’s “No Mercy,” the latter of which came out just months before this. “Cop Land” was obviously influenced by it a decade later. 

It’s rich with the ambiance of NOLA, including Cajun, zydeco, R&B, and gospel music in the soundtrack. Many praise Quaid’s thick Cajun accent while others view it as overdone. I side with the latter but, then, I tend not to care about accents in movies, so it’s all good (for me). It just seems Dennis’ head detective comes across too convivial, but this can be explained by the fact that Quaid later admitted to being coked-up during the shoot in which he was only sleeping one hour a night. Nevertheless, both Dennis and Ellen consider this the favorite of the many films they've made.

While it was overpraised at the time of release and I’d watch “Cat People” and “Cop Land” over it any day, it’s superior to “Fuzz” and certainly worth checking out for those interested. Aside from the amusing (and sometimes grisly) dramatics, not to mention Barkin’s beauty, I liked the insightful commentary on legalism: If you want to get technical about it, people break laws every day, like jaywalking. But what if you ARE the Law? Where do you draw the moral line? How much is too far? Where is the proverbial point of no return?

11030,A charming mockumentary about a fictional 1920s personality filmed as if cobbled together from old black-and-white footage.,6.0
11030,"Leonard Zelig is a ""human chameleon,"" but Zelig the film doesn't stop at mimicry. Indeed, this fictional documentary written, directed, and starring Woody Allen differentiates between imitation and parody the same way Hitchcock differentiated between action and suspense.

For example, the protagonist's parents used to punish him by locking him in a dark closet. If that were it, the film would simply be copying an aspect of Ingmar Bergman's childhood; Allen's genius lies in adding that when Zelig's parents are really mad, they ""get into the closet with him.""

Zelig's targets go beyond the filmmaker's family, and include the press (“in those days, you'd do anything to sell papers. To get a story, you'd jazz it up, exaggerate, even maybe play with the truth a little bit. But here was a story. It was a natural. You just told the truth and it sold papers. It never happened before""), politicians (""He was selling the same piece of property to a lot of the same people, and... Matter of fact, a congressman from Delaware bought it twice""), psychologists (“I worked with Freud in Vienna. Yes, we broke over the concept of penis envy. Freud felt that it should be limited to women”), and philosophers (“His performance endears him as well to many leading French intellectuals, who see in him a symbol for everything” ).

Set in the 1920s and 1930s, the film revolves around Leonard Zelig (Allen), an indistinct man who has the ability to alter his appearance and behavior to fit those of the people around him; e.g., “When two Frenchmen enter, Zelig assumes their characteristics and speaks reasonable French. In the company of a Chinese person, he begins to develop oriental traits;” etc etc.

This desire and ability to blend in ironically makes him an outcast; “Zelig's very existence is a non-existence. Devoid of personality, his human qualities long since lost in the confusion of life, he sits alone, silently staring into space, a figure, a non-person... The one who only wanted to fit in, to belong, to go unnoticed by his enemies and being loved, neither fits nor belongs, is supervised by enemies, and remains abandoned”. His protean nature also gives him access to a number of famous people and historical events. In this sense, Zelig is ahead of Forrest Gump, not only in that it precedes it, but also in that it surpasses it.

Zelig is disruptive in more ways than one; while Forrest finally fades into the background as a new, Zelig anarchically places his protagonist, much to his own dismay, front and center of the action; in the Vatican he creates commotion by interrupting a ritual that had not been celebrated in “63 years” (while “His Holiness Pope Pius XI tries to swat the intruder with a sacred decree”), and in Germany the greatest irony of all: his ""desired immersion in the mass and anonymity"" lead the Jew Zelig to join the Sturmabteilung — the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party — ruining Hitler’s speech at a Nazi rally (""We couldn't believe our eyes. Hitler's speech was ruined. He wanted to make a good joke about Poland, but just then, Zelig interfered and Hitler was extremely upset"").",6.0

Interspersed with some decently staged rock numbers that could easily have been seen on MTV, we are exposed to the extremes of venality and avarice, some completely bonkers lyrics and their gradual realisation that the grand stadium days are maybe long gone, now. The bickering always stays on the amiable side of toxic, but squabbles about their racy album cover being banned in Walmart, their shrinking appeal narrowed now to just to stoned-out students and their own peccadilloes deliver an enjoyably authentic looking and frequently quite funnily written analysis of life on the downward side of the showbiz mountain - and it's quite scathing of those who make a living out of it with little or no talent but a solid belief in what they see in the mirror.

11031,"**Interesting, remarkable for its subgenre, credible… but I didn't find it funny.**

I'm not a specific admirer of mockumentaries, but I recognize their value if they're funny. The film reports on the tour of a British rock band called Spinal Tap, and shows the enormous difficulties and crazy things they carry out on and off the stage. It's supposed to be a comedy... but, to be honest, it didn't make me laugh.

I recognize the value that this film had for the cinematographic subgenre it launched, and the interest that the film has for cinema students and others who deepen their knowledge of the seventh art in greater detail. For me, as I'm just a guy who watches films because he likes them, it's different: it's harder to convince me to watch this a second time because of the many technical arguments they might use. Being a comedy, it has to be funny. If it doesn't, it failed as a comedy (even considering the fact that I may not be the target audience, that would just be a sign that it's not a film for me).

Although it didn't make me laugh, I recognize that Rob Reiner does an interesting job and manages to give his film enormous authenticity on all levels. I wonder what fieldwork he did to prepare for the project, whether he spoke to journalists who follow the music industry, with bands or music artists, because in fact the film captures quite well the bizarre things that can happen on a rock tour. And the work of the main actors (Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest) is equally worthy if we consider that much of what they say is improvised at that moment, not previously written. The film looks cheap and this is perhaps even intentional: the cinematography resembles a “found-footage” film, with the image shaky, poorly calibrated, full of grain at times. The sets are very good and the soundtrack, made for the film, is absolutely believable.",6.0
11033,"Erotico Psycho

Dressed to Kill is directed and written by Brian De Palma. It stars Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon and Dennis Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Ralf D. Bode.

Brian De Palma continues his commitment to Hitchcock thrillers with this erotic and lurid slice of entertainment pie. Plot in short order finds a razor wielding blonde woman on the loose in the city. A high class prostitute, a psychiatrist and the son of a victim try to solve the mystery before they themselves fall to the blonde killer.

De Palma throws it all at the audience here, merrily pushing people's buttons as he goes. He uses all the tools and tricks of his trade for maximum impact, blending a number of genre staples and churning out a hyper stylised neo-noir that gleefully toys with audience expectations. Oh the plot is bonkers, deliriously so, but De Palma is a crafty pro who deftly marries up the excesses of the plot with virtuoso camera work, and not content with that he then brings Donaggio's musical score into play to ensure the viewer's senses are tingling.

Unsurprisingly for the director, Dressed to Kill is sexually charged and violent, from the steamy beginning that ruffled feathers in a number of quarters, to the outrageous coda at the end where De Palma homage's himself, it's a film revelling in its schlocky being. However, it still has time for dramatic suspense and dangerously sensual mysticism, reference an extended section of film that sees Allen's hooker pursued relentlessly through the perils of the subway system, and a sequence played out at an art gallery without dialogue as we become Dickinson's disoriented eyes. Then there is the key murder scene, a dizzying array of slashes and cartoonish blood, it's purposely excessive and followed by screw tightening suspense that sets up the rest of the movie.

De Palma and his on form principal cast members are having fun, how could they not with such trashy material to work from? Is Dressed to Kill phobic and misogynistic? Well plenty of people think so, in fact there was quite a fall out when the film was first released, when De Palma was subjected to the ire of a few minority groups. Judge for yourself is the only way to go really, but personally in amongst the schlock I feel there's comment on the dangers of fantasising beyond your realm, or of unfaithfulness, maybe even that America is itself irresponsible for its treatment of women on film? Of course it could just be De Palma at his most playful? Sitting there giggling to himself as others lose their cool… 8/10",8.0

This one turned out to be quite the rather enjoyable effort. A lot of the film’s great parts come from the manner in which this one deals with the expectations featured here of the film by following so close to its influences. As it follows so close to the main format here, as the general structure employed here comes directly with the structure of having the first half focus solely on the victim to get killed off and then morph over into the investigation into the incidents, that makes for a great deal of fun here as it deals with the few changes to be had with the storyline. That familiarity lends itself a great deal to the overall manner in which this one moves along as that keeps this one a lot more entertaining than it really should be without a whole lot of slashing action throughout here. With a big emphasis on the murder investigation and her involvement in the procedure, there’s a nice emphasis here to follow up the later adverts of that ones’ followers in a distinctly European manner by introducing not only the main investigation from the police but also going rather nicely into the amateur investigation by way of a piece of evidence only briefly glimpsed during the incident that becomes a central part of the investigation. These elements all give it a rather distinct and pronounced atmosphere to these brands of films which really lets it dwell in that type of sleaze far more comfortably than would be expected, not only from the type of nudity but also the rather stark sex scenes and frequently intoned psychosexual themes from the killer’s motivation which is straight out of that particular school of thriller which makes this one connect quite well there. Even with some incredibly well-done stalker scenes, including the opening attack in the elevator, the subway sequence or the finale at the office which give this some rather suspenseful stalking as well to balance it all with plenty to like. These don’t help the fact that there’s just not a whole lot of slasher action here, as the more thriller aspects here dominate this one so it doesn’t have a lot of stalking scenes and the body count itself is so low as to not really offer much in the way of bloodshed or gore. Those looking for a straight-up slasher won’t be interested in this one at all.

A sexually frustrated housewife in Manhattan (Angie Dickinson) does something foolish, which leads to a crime witnessed by an upscale prostitute (Nancy Allen). A therapist (Michael Caine), a detective (Dennis Franz) and a whiz kid (Keith Gordon) help try to solve the case.  

Helmed by Brian De Palma, ""Dressed to Kill"" (1980) is a psychological drama/thriller in the tradition of Hitchcock. You’ll see bits borrowed from “Rear Window,” “North by Northwest,” “Psycho” and De Palma’s own “Carrie.” Some of the subway sequences are reminiscent of “The Warriors” from the year prior. Speaking of which, there’s a cartoonish, over-the-top quality to the proceedings that smacks of “A Touch of Evil.” The theme revolves around sexual lust, such as the carnal need of some women to feel desired, as well as male arousal. If that turns you off, I suggest staying away.

This was made before the ADHD era and so the film takes its time in telling its story. For instance, the creative art museum sequence in the first act lasts 9 minutes and features zero dialogue, which arguably could have been done in less than half the time. While I didn’t personally mind it, most modern viewers will find it tedious and unnecessary. The same could be said of the curiously elongated ending which, again, I didn’t mind.

Nancy Allen was De Palma’s new wife during shooting in 1979, a marriage that would only last until 1983. He tastefully illustrates her beauty despite her character being a hooker, although some have criticized her scenes in black lingerie as “softcore porn.” She appears in the other De Palma films “Carrie,” “Home Movies” and “Blow Out.”

It’s best to go into this without knowing much else. The ending features a surprising twist that wouldn’t be done today for reasons of “political correctness” (rolling my eyes).

The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan with the art museum sequence done in Philadelphia.

It's supposed to be a love story, but the purported relationship between Redford and Farrow just doesn't resonate. I never really understood why she was so acclaimed in the first place - her performances were always rather hit or miss. The narration from Waterston also becomes a little too flat and the contrasting existences of the fabulously wealthy and the subsistence poor is hardly developed at all.

Directed by Brian G. Hutton and adapted to the screen from his own novel by Alistair MacLean, Where Eagles Dare stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. Music is scored by Ron Goodwin and cinematography is by Arthur Ibbetson.

A small group of allied agents are sent on a mission to rescue a Allied General from a Nazi castle stronghold. But there is more than what meets the eye here...

Boys own men on a mission in grandiose strokes, MacLean's complex story makes for riveting and exciting entertainment. The story twists and turns like a Python on acid, thus requiring full attention to conversational details is very much advised. And yet joyously it's the fun and kinetic action that holds the most attention, especially for what is quite an explosive and thrilling last third of picture. There are stunts galore amongst the Austrian Alps (beautifully photographed by Ibbetson), and as the espionage hokum reaches its crescendo status, so does the kinetic carnage, with the makers wasting no opportunity to blow everything up.

Burton is classy and enjoying himself, Eastwood laconic and cool, while good support comes from Mary Ure (great to have a well written spunky female lead), Patrick Wymark, Michael Hordern and Donald Houston. The running time is a touch too long as MacLean's prose is given weighty treatment for extended chatter, and some back projection work feels unnecessarily cheap for such a grand production, but this is good old machismo fuelled classic cinema regardless. 9/10",9.0
11046,"_**One of the greatest action/adventure films ever made**_

RELEASED IN 1968 and directed by Brian G. Hutton, ""Where Eagles Dare"" is a World War II adventure about handful of commandos parachuting into the wilderness surrounding a German castle-fortress high in the Bavarian Alps. Their mission is to rescue a captive general before the Germans can interrogate him. However, not everything is as it first appears.

The film is not a conventional World War II flick. Alistair Maclean wrote the script based on his novel and thus the movie is, unsurprisingly, a spy thriller just as much as it is a war picture. Keep in mind that spy flicks were super-hot when the film was released (e.g. James Bond). Are 60's spy films plausible? Realistic? No, they only have the veneer of plausibility and realism; underneath it's all escapist fantasy. So it is with ""Where Eagles Dare.""

The opening with the breathtaking Alps and Ron Goodwin's exhilerating score is one of the greatest cinematic openings in history. From there you get intrigue, thrilling action scenes, a magnificent castle, Richard Burton at his charismatic best, two beautiful women (Mary Ure and Ingrid Pitt), surprising plot twists, cable cars, a suspenseful escape and a don't-see-it-coming ending, not to mention Clint Eastwood.

Speaking of Eastwood, he plays a taciturn American lieutenant, second fiddle to Richard Burton, the British leader of the operation. Believe it or not, Burton's charisma is so out of the ball park that Eastwood pales by comparison. Of course, this has a lot to do with the way their roles were written, but you still have to give Burton credit for blowing Eastwood, who's no slouch, out of the water.

Some complain about the utter ruthlessness of the Allied commandos, particularly the characters played by Burton and Eastwood, but they're Special Forces on a secret mission, not conventional soldiers in infantry combat. They're professional killing machines, which is why they were given the job. There was no room for mercy in this operation at this stage in the war.

In any case, it's exciting to see Burton & Eastwood and their team mow down scores of Germans. The film's so well-done and compelling that you sorta don't realize how unbelievable it is while watching. This is because it lacks the cartoonish-ness of, say, ""Rambo 2"" and ""Rambo 3"" and maintains an air of realism throughout (which is different than saying it's realistic).

FINAL WORD: ""Where Eagles Dare"" is one of the greatest action/adventure films of all time and is as-good-or-better than any war flick you care to name. The exhilarating score itself is worth the price of admission, as is the opening. If you're in the mood for a World War II flick, ""Where Eagles Dare"" belongs near the top of the list.

11046,"When an American general's plane is forced down over Nazi Germany, it falls to ""Smith"" (Richard Burton) to lead a crack team into the depths of the Wehrmacht to get him out before a dose of scopalamine elicits the truth about the plans for an allied invasion of Europe. No sooner do they land, though, when things start to go wrong. With one of their number not even surviving the parachute drop into the snowy forest, ""Smith"" finds himself relying more heavily on American Ranger ""Schaffer"" (Clint Eastwood). The two have never met before this mission, and the latter man is frankly quite puzzled as to his inclusion on this British operation in the first place. The general is being held in the ""Schloß Adler"" high atop a rocky outcrop accessed only by helicopter or cable car - and there are thousands of troops stationed nearby. It's soon clear that someone in his team has dubious loyalties, and things becomes distinctly more perilous as they have to survive the hostile environment of the cold, avoid the pursuing soldiers and infiltrate the castle - where an even more deadly series of challenges await his dwindling group. Alistair MacLean was always quite good at adapting his novels for the screen in a way that alerts the audience to certain facts before the characters, and here that works effectively to create an action-packed adventure that is charismatically led by Burton and the engagingly laconic Eastwood and full of duplicity and betrayal with plenty of lovely pyrotechnics and a denouement that keeps us guessing right until the credits.

11050,"I hated the story, let's get that out of the way first. This film is about character acting at it's best, though, and Shirley MacLaine (""Aurora"") and Jack Nicholson (""Garrett"") bring us charisma and entertainment in spades which thankfully rescues the really pedestrian plot from abject mediocrity. Since her birth, ""Aurora"" has fussed over her daughter ""Emma"" (Debra Winger) and upon the death of her husband, settles down to a rather vicarious existence living life through her daughter, her husband ""Flap"" (Jeff Daniels) and their children. She is a strong willed woman, with love that can be gentle and kindly, or that can be rude and interfering with much of the frequently sardonic humour emanating from her disinclination to let them live their own lives. Next door we find ""Garrett"", a somewhat disreputable womaniser. A former astronaut who trades well on his erstwhile status, but who takes a bit of a shine to ""Aurora"" - and that's another source of lively comedy as the two clash with engaging regularity. The last hour descends rather quickly into melancholy, though, as the young ""Emma"" has to deal with her own problem husband, and an illness that starts to focus the attention from all concerned onto what really matters with their relationships. MacLaine is always good with these rough-round-the-edges roles and here there is plenty of chemistry on the sparing occasions in which she and Nicholson feature. Sadly, for me anyway, the rest of this hovers way too close to melodrama and though at its best it is really good, for the most part I was rather underwhelmed by the family antics that underpinned so much of the (over-long) story.",7.0
11051,"I come to this film as a bit of an agnostic, and so I rather appreciated the innovative take on the biblical events surrounding the life of Jesus Christ. It's an excellent Willem Dafoe who takes on that role as he roams the land of Palestine trying to spread a message of love. It's clear at the start that this is not Gospel-based, and that becomes evident as his closest ally is the sceptic ""Judas"" (Harvey Keitel) and by the fact that he makes a living making the cross-beams for the crucifixion crosses that the Romans use to execute his fellow citizens. As the story evolves, we are introduced to the characters who ended up being his apostles and we uncover more of a man who is constantly facing temptation - of the spirit and of the flesh - at the hands of a father who seems determined to test the very fabric of his son's essence. It largely follows the well trammelled path of previous ""King of Kings"" style chronologies but there are plenty of variations in the detail of the characterisations and some of the more memorable quotations and ""miracles"" are adapted. That doesn't always work and many of the most significant phrases from Christian literature are delivered a little underwhelmingly. A bit like saying ""Alas poor Yorick - he used to be a mate of mine..."" sort of thing, and that's where it feels a little uncomfortably akin to ""Life of Brian"" (1979). It's the last forty minutes that offers us much of the potency of the film (and it's title) and that's where the story becomes much more provocative - both intellectually and physically. In hindsight, given the way the life of Jesus is continually depicted as having/living, this offers us a perfectly rational continuation of his forty day ordeal in the desert and it also imbues the man with an innate degree of humanity and frailty that I found touching and plausible. It also quite openly postulates that ""God"" might be vengeful, might not be this benign entity and that perhaps deities in general are a creation of mankind's necessity for hierarchy and search for an understanding of the inexplicable rather than evidentially based on some miraculously benevolent being whose love of his children (us) is boundless. Barbara Hershey provides an emotionally engaging performance as the prostitute Mary Magdalene and there's the odd laugh in here too (especially if you are named Judith) to temper the accruing intensity of the story. I didn't really love the photography, and the occasional use of slo-motion seemed a bit incongruous, but that's nit picking. It's thought-provoking regardless of whether or not you have a religious frame of mind, and though a little on the slow side out of the starting gates, matures into something that challenges established and contrary perspectives and is well worth a watch.",7.0

Internal Affairs is directed by Mike Figgis and written by Henry Bean. It stars Richard Gere, Andy Garcia, Nancy Travis, William Baldwin and Laurie Metcalf. Music is jointly produced by Figgis, Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by John A. Alonzo.

Stylish neo-noir that has Gere as Dennis Peck, a crooked cop under investigation by IAD operatives Garcia and Metcalf.

Peck is a master manipulator, a devious bastard who has his fingers in so many mud pies he could start his own bakery. Gere is on fire with the role, imbuing Peck with a menacing nastiness that’s a constant throughout the entire play. 

Once Figgis and Bean have laid the character foundations, the plot turns into a psychological battle of wills and skills between Peck and Raymond Avila (Garcia), with Peck always one step ahead because he knows where Avila’s weakness is.

Figgis slow burns the tension with great aplomb, then unleashes the beasts for the thriller aspects of Bean’s screenplay. The look and feel of the piece is that of doom, deftly positing Peck’s vileness within a city awash with crooks, hookers and hitmen for hire. 8/10",8.0

When Andy Garcia is brought in to investigate goings on at his precinct, he quickly concludes that Gere's partner - the aptly named ""Van Stretch"" (William Baldwin) is a bit of a no good wife beater, and soon he and Gere are at loggerheads. The screenplay doesn't pull it's punches - this is an out and out depiction of domestic violence, thuggery and police corruption; and not just of one rogue officer, but of an internecine network that stretches far and wide. Gere is just OK - to be honest. He never was my favourite actor and playing the bad guy by the odd vaguely menacing glance whilst lobbing in the odd f-word didn't go anywhere near enough to remove that gentle goody-goody image. The only hair-raising thing Andy Garcia seemed likely to have ever done would have involved a heck of a lot of gel, and the whole thing has a certain professionalism about the production that neutralised, effectively, anything gritty or sordid about their behaviour.

The first half was decent and involving, but it kind of slid off the rails, interest-wise for me, the rest of the way and got too talky and uninspired.

I don't really know if the problem was with the script or its direction. I know I'm not the greatest John Cusack fan in the world (I find he's much better in comedy, like his sister Joan), but he had pretty good co-stars, whose talents were basically wasted, in Martin Landau, Anthony Franciosa and Danny Aiello (these guys were BORN for these roles and films, so on paper, this should have really worked out well). I had always wondered why this film had bombed so miserably, and now I know why. In cases like this, more should have been done to alter the story arc, just some basic tweaks, to make it more suspenseful and/or (though I usually balk at such 'Hollywood' tendencies) some romantic tension (a beauty such as Fonda's was misused--they may as well have hired someone else).

Two 20-something couples and others explore life & love during the advent of the grunge scene in Seattle. Dillon's character is the only one musically involved in the scene, as the vocalist of the band Citizen Dick. The two couples are played by Campbell Scott & Kyra Sedgwick and Bridget Fonda & Dillon while other cast members include Sheila Kelley and Bill Pullman.  

Although ""Singles"" was released in September 1992 it was actually shot in March-May, 1991, a full half a year _before_ the explosion of grunge music with the success of Nirvana's NEVERMIND. Writer/director Cameron Crowe originally wrote the script in 1984 with the setting of Phoenix in mind but rewrote it six years later inspired by how the burgeoning Seattle grunge community came together after the death of Mother Love Bone's singer in March, 1990.

The flick is a little reminiscent of 2001's ""Rock Star,"" but the latter is better IMHO simply because it focuses more on the music scene than romantic relationships. Not to mention the style of music in ""Rock Star"" is metal, which is preferable in my book (although Alice In Chain's song performed live for this movie definitely smacks of metal).

The very title ""Singles"" tips off that this is a romcom focusing on dating. As such, if you favor dating movies you'll probably like ""Singles,"" even if you don't particularly like grunge. Speaking of which, the soundtrack includes cuts by grunge luminaries Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Alice In Chains, Mother Love Bone, Jane's Addiction, Smashing Pumpkins and Screaming Trees, amongst others. In fact, quite a few grunge stars have cameos, such as Chris Cornell, Layne Staley, Eddie Vedder and Kim Thayil.

11069,"The Shriekers!

After the huge love and deserved critical praise for Ron Underwood’s 1990 film, Tremors, this in spite of poor box office and lead man Kevin Bacon disowning the film at the time, sequels were always likely. And so it proved.

Fred Ward and Michael Gross return from the first film and are joined by Christopher Gartin, Helen Shaver and Marcelo Tubert. Underwood hands over the directing reins to S.S. Wilson and co-produces instead, while music is by Jay Ferguson and cinematography by Virgil Harper.

In spite of adding some new beasties into the mix, it all feels very same old same old, only without the funny script and any sense of peril. What made Tremors so strong was that even as it had its tongue in its cheek, homaging 1950s creature features with a proud sense of being, it was still scary and suspenseful. The characters there gave a believable sense of danger and fright, here it’s just done for laughs, we never once think the principal players are remotely scared of the Graboids and their offspring.

Story has advanced for Earl (Ward) and Burt (Gross), where this time it’s Earl who is romancing (Shaver under used but lovely) and Burt is all on his lonesome as his Mrs (Heather played by Reba McEntire) has left him on account of his love of war and weapons, a joke which grows old very fast here. Still, when the action isn’t of the budget CGI kind, it’s well staged and good fun, though Wilson’s comic sequence shooting is flat, while Ward is a strong enough actor to carry the film to keep it above average.

Trouble escalates to the big city of Los Angeles when one of the giant queen ants escapes to L.A. and starts laying eggs that could lead to the end of mankind as we know it.

This is a cautionary tale about scientific tampering fused with a Cold War theme of destroying a threat to the country. Boasting some wonderful scenes such as the first desert encounter (cloaked in a sandstorm) and the final underground battle, Them! is a truly enjoyable viewing experience. It oozes the right amount of paranoia that became ever more prominent as the nuclear age began grow. The puppetry and special effects on show is of a very high standard for the time (well done Academy Award Nominee Ralph Ayres), and the direction from Gordon Douglas is one of the better efforts in the genre.

The tight story vanquishes any gripes about the plausibility factor, while the acting is, perhaps given the type of genre piece it is, of a surprisingly good standard. With James Whitmore, Edmund Gwenn, and Joan Weldon giving it a bit of oopmh. It went on to become Warner Brothers highest grossing film in 1954, and it's really not hard to see why.

Especially unique since I am Gen-X and there is that whole rejection of labels thing and her generation is obsessed with labels. And the not understanding satire or dark humor thing that plagues that generation. And, of course, the fact that my generation kind of raised ourselves and hers, well, I have to explain things like why you don't mix coloreds and whites when you do laundry.

Anyway, getting her and her besties to sit down and watch anything older than 4 years is an uphill battle... again a uniquely Millennial thing. This is odd to me since I was born after this came out, and, honestly, love a lot of movies even decades older than me.... it's the new ones I don't like.

So I begged, and I pleaded, and I finally got them to watch Blazing Saddles, on the basis that I actually forced my wife (at gun point, and knife point) to watch Young Frankenstein and she loved it.

Blazing Saddles lasted about 10 minutes before they got upset by the racism.

But they she and her best friend and her boyfriend sat it out anyway, and by the end of the movie they were throwing a fit about racism as if I sat them down to watch Birth of a Nation.

So I found myself with an angry wife and two very angry friends all pretty much accusing me of being William Luther Pierce.

Still not sure what happened there. Something went horribly wrong. This movie kind of mocks racism doesn't it? it turns it into a joke so people can't take it seriously any longer and makes the viewer think that anyone who wears a white robe is an idiot. An absolute moron.

And yet their collective reaction kind of assumed the opposite.

""Hedley Lamarr"" (Harvey Korman) is out to trash his own town so he can buy up the land cheaply for his railroad. What better way to drive folks away than to appoint an African-American sheriff? The shrewd ""Bart"" (Cleavon Little) knows full well that he has precisely no support from his community - not the sharpest tools in the box - so he signs up the mean ""Waco Kid"" (Gene Wilder) as his deputy. A gunslinger of ill-repute, he and his boss gradually convince the sheepish townsfolk that they can fight back against the scheming ""Lamarr"" and maybe even foil his not so cunning plan. My personal favourite scene has to be the wonderful imitation of Marlene Dietrich by Madeline Kahn singing ""I'm Tired"", but there are loads of other skits of everything from ""High Noon"" to ""Chisum"" with Slim Pickens and David Huddleston providing some genuine western credentials to the proceedings. Auteur Mel Brooks pops up once or twice, in differing guises, to add a bit of additional comedy to his already quite daft storyline that is respectful of cowboy movies but also quite potently critical of their stereotyping characters, their repetitive storylines and usually, their entirely predictable conclusions. This mixes all of that up with Little and Wilder gelling well, presenting us with a genuinely laugh out loud, occasionally slap-stick, critique of one hundred years of a theme of cinema that has probably not really evolved that much since 1874!",7.0
11074,"Comic book cop thriller in Pittsburgh with Bruce Willis and Sarah Jessica Parker

RELEASED IN 1993 and written/directed by Rowdy Herrington, “Striking Distance” stars Bruce Willis as Tom Hardy, a Pittsburgh detective who's demoted to river rescue. A serial killer returns after a two-year absence and bodies of beautiful women start turning up in the river, all women whom Hardy used to date! Sarah Jessica Parker is on hand as Hardy's partner on the river, Jo Christman.

The movie has a bad reputation. Roger Ebert tore it to pieces, basically saying it was too derivative and by-the-numbers, and Willis himself said he hated it. I can understand criticism to a point. The story has a melodramatic comic-book vibe, which is obvious in the opening act, almost like a TV production except with a superior cast and action scenes. But, and this is an important “but,” I found myself drawn into the story & the characters and greatly enjoyed the rare Pittsburgh locations, as well as the (melo)drama and thrills. In other words, the movie is entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.

This is a cop thriller in the manner of the Dirty Harry series, especially “The Dead Pool” (1988), except it’s more comic booky and taking place in Pittsburgh rather than San Francisco. It's also reminiscent of films like ""The General's Daughter"" (1999). Although not technically as good as the Dirty Harry movies or ""The General's Daughter"" due to its cartoonish-ness, ""Striking Distance"" nevertheless pulled me into the lives of the characters and, for the most part, furnished the requisite thrills.

The generically-named movie (also akin to the Dirty Harry franchise) was originally called ""Three Rivers,” a much better title simply because it's more specific, but was changed at the last minute because the marketing department feared people would think it was a sports movie due to Three Rivers Stadium, so they switched it to ""Striking Distance."" Why “Striking Distance”? The first hint is at the beginning of the movie when the title card shows two electrical bolts coming out from either side of the title. Later we observe the mysterious killer using a stun gun before killing his victims and, with a stun gun, you must of course be within... striking distance!

Speaking of the killer, one element of the plot I haven't mentioned is that this is a whodunit. Someone is charged with being the killer early on but Hardy knows it's the wrong guy; he and others are sure it's a cop or ex-cop doing the killings. There are a few suspects, including Hardy himself, but I honestly was unable to guess the right person. There's another twist late in the story that also took me by surprise.

""Striking Distance"" may not be exceptional and is marred by cartoonish exaggeration, but it entertains as a cop thriller and that's what's most important when it comes to these types of flicks. Plus it was shot in Pittsburgh, a refreshing change.

Right from the outset, we realise that Captain Bligh (Trevor Howard) is not a man to mess with. He is a brutal authoritarian who punishes the slightest of misdemeanours from his crew mercilessly. As the voyage proceeds, fresh water runs short and the food starts to move about the plate by itself, the men turn to Lt. Christian (Brando) for some sort of relief. The two officers are pretty much at odds from the start with the flamboyant subordinate quite a contrast to the ship's more hardened master. It's their arrival on the island that finally causes the men to reach breaking point and for Christian to execute the unthinkable in maritime law. The story is history, so we now what happens as Howard turns in a remarkably convincing effort - his deep and gravelly voice helps too - as the commander who would rather water the trees than his men. Richard Harris, Hugh Griffith and a face of recognisable Britons pad out the crew effectively and the aesthetics of the production, especially at sea, are powerfully illustrative of the dangers to the sailors of the sea and their taskmaster.

The production is maybe just a bit too pristine, too sterile, to sustain the sense of peril and the dialogue is just too wordy with scenarios taking too long to cook. Still, it's quite watchable film just one that I think has dated rather over the last thirty years into a mediocre television thriller.",7.0

Presumed Innocent is directed by Alan J. Pakula, who also co-adapts for the screen with Frank Pierson from the Scott Turow novel. It stars Harrison Ford, Brian Dennehy, Bonnie Bedelia, Raúl Juliá, Paul Winfield, John Spencer and Greta Scacchi. Music is scored by John Williams and Richard Wolf, and cinematography is by Gordon Willis.

Prosecuting attorney Rusty Sabich (Ford) suddenly finds himself a murder suspect after his one time lover, Carolyn Polhemus (Scacchi), is found raped and murdered in her home. As the evidence piles up against him, and his marriage comes under further strain, Rusty hires top lawyer Sandy Stern (Juliá) to represent him when the case goes to trial. Battling the system that he knows inside out, Rusty finds that there's a big can of worms about to be opened.

A tip top court room mystery drama that we could do with seeing more of these days. Expertly strung together by the director of All the Presidents Men and Sophie's Choice, Presumed Innocent isn't just a by the numbers legal who done it? The makers get in deep with the political machinations of a district attorney's office, the intricate steps of a police investigation, and of course the legal eagle operations of a court room. In to the mix is an horrendous crime, of which a lawyer himself is charged with committing, he may or may not be guilty of the crime, but wonderfully we are never sure until the astonishing finale plays out. The air of mystery hangs heavy throughout, nagging away like an itch you can't scratch, with Pakula neatly unfolding the drama in a collage of flashbacks, side-plots and present time intricacies. Mood is heightened by the photography of Gordon Willis, who along with Pakula's looming camera work, manages to convey a claustrophobic feel in keeping with an unstable marriage and a court room itself.

A great cast is assembled for the picture. Ford expertly plays it low key, brooding intently, he makes us unsure as to his guilt or innocence, and that's a testament to how good his performance is. Bedelia is excellent as the stoic wife, holding it together as the marital cracks begin to appear, and Juliá dominates the second half of the picture as we shift to the court room. Dennehy does a nice line in morally compromised smarm, and Scacchi wonderfully exudes a femme fatale sexuality. Winfield is a mighty presence as the judge presiding over such a tricky case, and Spencer is as reliable as ever. Only disappointments come with the performances of Joe Grifasi and Tom Mardirosian, who as the prosecutors come across as wimpy and hardly brick tight lawyers trying a high profile murder case.

An intense and intellectual adult drama, Presumed Innocent is one of the best of its type from the modern era. 8.5/10",8.0
11104,"A week has passed since I watched this film. I wanted to let it sit with me for a bit before watching it again and giving it a proper response.

Films like this, which are hyped to an unbelievable degree, end up sending an audience to end up watching it with elevated expectations, only to be ultimately disappointed afterwards. It’s a fact that many films suffer considerably from this aspect of our cinephile culture, I’ve experienced it with many films before.

_Chungking Express_ has a reputation that I think may be beyond what it intended, with it being an Out-of-Print title at Criterion, the prices for the Blu-ray being obnoxiously high, and the constant barrage of exuberant reactions from many who’ve seen the film. This kind of superficial intrigue alone can set me up with expectations that are likely to not be met. Every film that is being made does not intend to create this façade of a reputation, it’s just a film. Most creators are not there to make this kind of reaction happen out of their films, and yet, we somehow continue to do so…

I’m rambling, aren’t I? I think this is just my criticism with film culture regarding the hyping of certain films.

And yet, somehow, despite my attempts to condense these (potential) hyperbolic reactions, _Chungking Express_ may have exceeded my expectations. Perhaps that makes me a hypocrite regarding this issue, but then again, if I enjoyed the film to the extent at which it met my expectations (or surpassed them in this case), am I to be negatively looked at for criticizing these actions, but essentially having them work on me specifically with _Chungking Express_? If so, then let it be I guess. Regardless, this film was one of the best experiences I have had in a while.

It is surprisingly easy for me to connect with this film and its characters. All of them have a certain struggle they must deal with, whether it’d be relationship problems, not being able to move on, or even simply failing to accomplish a certain task. It’s all relatively simple if I think about it, there isn’t much in terms of characterization for many of the subjects in the film, and yet, I don’t believe there needs to be that much. Simply leaving it the way it is works extremely well, and I’m willing to believe that Wong Kar-Wai understood this.

There are statements that explain how Wong Kar-Wai essentially wrote scenarios for the film the morning of and shot the scenes later in the day. Easily, this could lead to a jumbled mess of separate ideas thrown together in the editing room at a feature length time. And yet, he stays consistent in the thematic ideas he proposes. Shot chronologically, the ideas set up through the first half of the film, have threads that continue onwards towards the second half.

One of my favorite directors, Krzysztof Kieślowski, uses the elements of interconnectedness within his films. Regardless of how different the stories might be, there is something there that connects each story together. In _Chungking Express_, that idea is essentially brought out brazenly, to the extent at which it initially shocked me. That one moment at the half-way mark of the film, comes at you so fast, that afterwards you’re left gasped for what the film turns into. It’s a brazen switch of narrative, and yet, it’s still leaves the film to be connected altogether.

The expectations for love are very much tricky in it of themselves, as is shown with each character that one sees in the film. It’s not simple, it isn’t black and white, but rather a spectrum that one must align itself with, and possibly adapt to if necessary. To deal with the aspects of love in a film can either be hokey and misguided, or it can be meticulous and interesting. _Chungking Express_ finds a middle ground between these two, not dealing too much towards the intellectual side of these issues, but not straying away too far towards the clichéd. Wong Kar-Wai doesn’t treat these characters as caricatures. Sure, there are some humorous; sometimes childish, moments with Faye, but it doesn’t take away from her character. As with every subject in the film, there is something to latch on to. All around the thematic ideas of love, or the lack thereof, worked together so well, that it leads to these characters feeling authentic. Not simply words on a script.

I really don’t know what else to say. I was awestruck the first time, and I feel even more so now. This is a film that really hit it home with me. More so than other films in the past.

I’ll say this, by the end of the film, I had similar vibes to when I finished _Lost in Translation_ for the first time. Soon afterwards, that film was my favorite of all time for years.

Film culture is fascinating, it may lead to disappointing outcomes based on hyperbolic expectations, or it may lead to a film experience that you never thought were possible.

I’m beginning to lean towards the latter with _Chungking Express_.


What a difference a day made, what a difference a film makes.

11104,"This is probably my favourite film from Kar-Wai Wong. It tells the stories of two Hong Kong Police officers. The former, the dashing Takeshi Kaneshiro, who is struggling to come to terms with his recently ended relationship of five years. By way of a means to closure, he purchases a tin of pineapple each day with the expiry date of May 1st (then he will be 25 years old). Either they will have reconciled by then, or he must look for a new love - and perhaps an enigmatic, somewhat shady, lady in a raincoat and wearing a blonde wig might offer a solution? The second features the slightly older regular with this director, Tony Leung, who has also split from his long-term partner only to find a new girl working at the stall he gets his meal from in the evening. She is equally enigmatic - and has a penchant for ""California Dreamin'"" played very loudly too. Both stories are throughly enjoyable to watch, the humour is plentiful and subtle - and we are never quite sure how anything is going to pan out, or even if the two stories are going to end up over-lapping - right until the end. The hand held photography helps the personalities develop well, offering us intimacy and also an opportunity to become more immersed in the two gently developing character studies that are imbued with the colours and culture of this bustling urban landscape.",7.0
11104,"Filmed into the post production of two years of filming the Wuxia epic ""Ashes of Time"", with low resources, this movie is another example that we don't need millions of USD to make a masterpiece.

Wong Kar-Wai have a personal style of using melancholic characters distorted stories, using elaborate soundtracks in the background. This movie show two drama and crime stories about two lovesick policeman and their search over his relationship with a woman, always in a 0,01cm encounter of distance between them. 

The first story stars Takeshi Kaneshiro as a cop obsessed by his breakup with a woman named May (replaced emotionally with letters and old pineapple cans), and his encounter with a mysterious drug smuggler. The second stars Tony Leung as a police officer roused from his gloom over the loss of his flight attendant girlfriend by the attentions of a quirky snack bar worker called Express - referred in the title (Faye Wong).

Both stories circles around Chungking Mansions, a 60's complex of buildings supposed to be residential, but that is made up of many independent low-budget hotels, shops and other services, filled with stores and stalls in the building cater to wholesalers shipping goods to Africa and South Asia, and amid the gigantic Central–Mid-Levels escalator with a length of 800m and one of the two highlights locations of the movie.

Both sequences have a unique visual approach sometimes intimate, sometimes frenetic with a beautiful use of color among the chaos that reminds me of the works of the photographer Saul Leiter.

On the unique soundtrack using ocidental musics we have the use for the first story is Dennis Brown's ""Things in Life"" and ""Baroque"", composed by Michael Galasso, can be heard twice during the first part of the movie.

On the second ""California Dreamin'"" by The Mamas & the Papas plays in the key scenes in the second story, which also features Faye Wong's Cantonese cover version of ""Dreams"" by The Cranberries.

In the plans of making there was a third movie but since it was too long it was released as a separate movie, Fallen Angels in 1995.

11109,"Imelda Staunton is great here as the middle-aged wife, merrily living her family life with husband ""Stan"" (Phil Davis) and her two grown up children and their partners. She is well respected by her peers and seems to be the epitome of the hardworking 1950s British housewife. Until, that is - a policeman arrives at her door and her world starts to cave in. Now we know from fairly early on that ""Vera"" likes to help girls out. To be fair - there are plenty of them who are eligible. Raising a family when rationing was still around, jobs thin on the ground and their men folks usually keen to run a mile (if they even knew/or cared) was a daunting prospect to many a young woman, bereft of familial or state support. She didn't take cash for her carbolic and syringe services, she just thinks she is doing the best for all concerned. Needless to say the morals of the time did not necessarily concur, the law certainly didn't - and so we are faced with a rather well presented and written analysis of the antiquated and illiberal situation in which many women found themselves. The film doesn't attempt to moralise - it allows each of us to observe her activities and to evaluate - almost on a case by case basis - the relative merits of her interventions and I think that is particularly effective when stimulating the debate that this film is bound to create. The supporting cast including a career defining contribution from Daniel Mays as her conflicted son ""Sid"", Eddie Marsan and Heather Craney allow the story to spread out covering not just the actions of ""Vera"" but also of the complicity - sympathetically and/or venally motivated - by those in the medical profession and those in the community who had less scruples in monetising the misfortune of others. Above all, this is thought provoking - there is no simple answer to what's going on here, and for that Staunton (and Mike Leigh) are to be commended. It's not for the fainted-hearted, but the most poignant of films never are.",7.0
11113,"The difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she is treated. 

Upper crust phonetics Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) agrees to a wager that he can make brash London speaking flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) presentable in high society. 

Lerner and Loewe's Broadway version of George Bernard Shaw's play ""Pygmalion"" comes to the big screen and is an utter joy. A winner of 8 well deserved Oscars, pic boasts top line performances, songs that either gladden or melt the heart, gorgeous costumes (Cecil Beaton) and in director George Cukor the venture had a man who knew how to blend together the theatrical with the core basics of human interactions. 

Julie Andrews had played Eliza Doolittle on the stage and it was something of a sore point to many that Hepburn got the gig for this filmic version. It really doesn't matter, Andrews went off and made another ode to joy in ""Mary Poppins"", while here Hepburn (dubbed by the wonderful Marni Nixon for the musical numbers) absolutely lights up the screen by being funny, heart warming and simply gorgeous in equal measures.

Not for everyone of course, it asks for a lot of patience since it runs at 170 minutes, while some back story issues (which I care not a jot to write about) irk others. Yet to me this is never one where I find myself looking at the clock, I'm too busy tapping my feet and being beguiled by it all.

11113,"**A film with a lot of quality, but also with some mistakes that are difficult to forgive.**

This is one of those films that I heard a lot about before I actually decided to sit down and watch it. It is considered by many to be one of the greatest musicals of all time, and I can agree that it is really very good and deserves this award. However, it was not entirely to my liking, as I will have the chance to explain.

Heavily inspired by the classic story of Pygmalion, the script takes us to the early years of the 20th century to meet a boastful linguist called Prof. Henry Higgins. He is an expert in languages and diction, and is fully convinced that the majority of British people do not know how to speak their language correctly (my question is whether there are, in any country, that many people who value their mother tongue). And to prove the usefulness of this domain, he decides to take a very simple and popular woman, the flower seller Eliza, into his own home and train her like a dog. When it's all over, he effectively achieved a big change in that girl, both in terms of speech and behavior, as well as in terms of mentality and life expectations.

This leads me to talk about what bothers me most: the way that annoying and presumptuous character decides to use another person for his purposes without thinking about that. Higgins is a selfish and egoic man, as well as being clearly misogynistic and thinking he has the power to mold people to his liking. In addition, the script confuses different things: knowing how to speak well and knowing how to behave in society. I can know how to speak my language in the most perfect way and not know the rules I should follow at a social ball or gala dinner. They are different things. The issue is addressed in the Ascott scenes, but we are left without knowing how Eliza learned to behave from then on.

On a technical level, the film is incredible. It seeks to adapt a Broadway musical, but it also draws a lot of inspiration from an older film, from the 30s. Thus, it has excellent melodies and songs, the same as the original musical. Unfortunately, the actors barely sing a syllable: they were sung by professionals off-stage, in a bad decision by the producers that greatly upset Audrey Hepburn herself. Another flaw is the confusion in the period conception: the film takes place in 1911 or 1912, but there is a wide range of later props and a moment in which the English king is not the one who actually reigned at the time. The film largely compensates for these flaws with excellent cinematography, very well framed and bright, full of vibrant and intense colors (note: I saw the restored version of the film), and with incredible costumes, particularly those made for Hepburn, and which still have a place today in private collections and museums: I think one of her costumes was auctioned off for a fortune a few years ago.

The cast has several important actors. Audrey Hepburn brilliantly assumes the role of Eliza, which had previously been played by Julie Andrews on Broadway, and takes advantage of this opportunity to clearly demonstrate her talent. However, I feel that the film doesn't take full advantage of the actress' potential and doesn't give her the space to give her all. Thus restrained, Hepburn does what she can, but fans will be able to see her in much better shape in other films. The one who dominates the scene the most is Rex Harrison: the actor exudes talent and seems perfectly suited for the character that, in fact, he had played on Broadway for a few years. We cannot forget the contributions of Stanley Holloway and Jeremy Brett, who do a very good job on underutilized characters.",8.0
11113,"A recent survey asserted that the English had the sexiest accents in the world. Perhaps not exactly the sort of recognition ""Prof. Henry Higgins"" (Rex Harrison) was seeking when, exasperated by the standards of his native language being spoken around London, he plucks poor ""Eliza"" (Audrey Hepburn"") from her flower-selling and promises his equally plummy friend ""Col. Pickering"" (Wilfred Hyde-White) that he can train her to pass in more refined society as a Duchess. Despite her initially raucous protestations - exemplifying his very point, the two lock in a battle of wills that ultimately challenges both of their opinions of each other, and dare we even suspect - engenders perhaps some respect... or more...? Oscar, BAFTA & Golden Globe winning Harrison is superb as the jovially pompous professor whose disdain for just about everything and everyone is writ large, Hepburn (with a lot of musical assistance from Marni Nixon) manages the transformation from ""gutter snipe"" to ""toff"" magnificently and there are some wonderfully characterful contributions from Stanley Holloway as her (rather venal) father; from Gladys Cooper as his rather astute mother and of course the arbiter of all things elocutionary - ""Prof. Karpathy"" (Theodore Bikel) who famously concludes that our poor ""Eliza"" is Hungarian! George Cukor has worked his magic well here with a superbly colourful, pithy and engaging adaptation of the original Shaw story and the score from Lerner and Loewe offers us some of the best rhyming lyrics ever put on paper: ""Why Can't The English"" and ""I could have Danced All Night"" being two particular favourites as well as Holloway's cracking ""I'm Getting Married in the Morning"". In a time of much more in-your-face politically correct dramatisations, I think folks could take a look at this cleverly constructed swipe at intellectual and sexual ""superiority"" and see the best man win - even if she isn't a man...",7.0
11121,"_**Bringing in the sheaves stuck between a demon and an angel**_ 

During the Long Depression of the 1870-80s in Blackmore Vale, southern England, a peasant family discovers that they are nobility and thus their oldest daughter, an extraordinarily beautiful woman (Nastassja Kinski), is sent to meet the well-to-do family. She is eventually pitted between the interest of two very different men (Leigh Lawson and Peter Firth).   

Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" (1979) is based on Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles."" Polanski was inspired to make the film because his late wife, Sharon Tate, gave him the book suggesting it would make a great film and she was interested in playing the title role. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the last time Roman saw his pregnant wife alive as she was heading back to the USA while he stayed in Europe to complete a picture. She was murdered by the Manson psychos on August 9th, 1969. This movie is dedicated to her during the opening credits.

The two male characters are basically two sides of the same bad coin: one is amoral while the other is excessively moral. There is a scene in the book where Alec shows up to talk to the workers at harvest time wearing a cape with an upturned collar and carrying a pitchfork. The symbolism is obvious. Meanwhile Angel's figurative character is plain from his name. What's the point? Just as it's possible to be excessively bad, a person can be too good. The bible makes this observation in Ecclesiastes 7:16-18. They are two extremes and both have the power to destroy the lives of those they influence. To be expected, Angel eventually seeks to make things right whereas Alec arrogantly continues in his nonchalant amorality, which ultimately ushers in doom. The immutability of this is symbolized by Stonehenge.

While a lot of people eventually swing to one extreme perspective/lifestyle or another, e.g. moralist, hedonist, atheist, most people are caught somewhere in the middle, uncertain and searching, like Tess.

To enjoy this piece you have to brace yourself for a movie that has the confidence to take its time and tell its tale. You'll discover Victorian curiosities, pastoral mundaneness, beauty, lust, love, idiocy, humility, penitence, arrogance and tragedy.

A catastrophic earthquake hits Southern California and begins to level Los Angeles...

""It's not a negative to have heart in the disaster genre of film""

Take yourself to 1974, are you there? Good, now maybe you can appreciate this film a little more? Maybe? Earthquake does suffer from old age, it's a statement we see and hear a lot, but it's a fact that some film's stand the test of time whilst others do not. In this desensitised computer age, it is easy to forget that not all the tools available in film making today were available back when film's like this were being made. So as is my want, I firmly judge this as a 1974 offering, to which it delivers enough entertainment to fully satisfy my genre leanings and entertainment persuasions.

The main complaint of many is the long build up of the characters, cries of boring can be read across internet forums and critics blogs. I just don't see it that way, yes we want the quake and the mayhem destruction that will follow it, because really this is a disaster film after all, but is it so bad that the film has heart to go with the crash bang wallop? After the build up of characters, where relationships and character traits are formed, the disaster strikes and it doesn't disappoint, utter destruction as effects and noise fill the eyes and ears, where those with a good home cinema system finding it literally does rock the house. We are then treated to a series of sequences that hold and engage our attention, upsetting passages of human sadness, punctured by heroic surges as Heston and the fabulous Kennedy set about saving life, hell! saving the town even. Then it's the film's fitting finale, where there are no cop outs, the makers choosing to go out with a darker edge than the detractors give it credit for.

Some can scoff at a blood splat effect, or rant about some of the acting on show, but Earthquake achieves two important things. One is that it entertains as a visual experience (quality model work), the other is that it doesn't soft soap the devastating effects of an earthquake. As the camera pulls away from a ravaged L.A. the impact is sombre, where reflection is needed and most assuredly surely gotten. 7/10",7.0

""Genovia"" is way more believable here, thanks to us actually getting to see it for real - as opposed to it just being referenced.

As noted, there are still a few cringey moments and it does run too long. There are some sweets parts, though. It's also kinda weird that, technically, Mia and Nicholas are related; a number of generations back sure, but still...

A sequel that (minorly) improves on its predecessor, that's always a positive in my book.",7.0

Ultimately this movie is fun: cheap teen girl drama fun, but fun.  Lindsey Lohan has some competent cast to share the load in this, particularly Alison Pill (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Cooties), an under rated actress, and Megan Fox (Jennifer's Body) playing the Rachel McAdams (Meangirls) of the movie.

I understand that location shooting can get expensive, but the movie looks over all well produced, and while the premise is rather annoying, the writing looks fairly solid, if character driven:  not a bad thing, but it usually makes for more interesting tidbits as opposed to an epic a plot line, which was....different depending upon what angle you take.

<em>'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen'</em> has a few things going in its favour. Lindsay Lohan is very good, she definitely makes her character more interesting than she probably would've been without Lohan. You also have Megan Fox in her first sizeable film role, it's actually kinda odd seeing those two together onscreen for some reason.

Away from them, I enjoyed the editing and cinematography for the most part. I'm not saying it's anything insane or memorable but it's better than I would've predicted. The premise isn't the most clearly defined, at least in terms of its execution; it starts to drag from the midway point. It hits a fair amount of clichés too, though does avoid a few also; Lola (Lohan) doesn't instantly befriend Carla (Fox), for one.

11152,"***Horror adventure in the Mayan jungle***

RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Carter Smith based on Scott B. Smith’s novel, ""The Ruins"" refuses to make the mistake of too many conventional horror flicks by NOT going over-the-top with the situation, the ""monster"" or the horrific thrills; films that do so are usually more goofy than horrifying. Take the ending of ""The Ruins,” which is different than the book and, in my opinion, better: In a typical horror movie there would've been a wild (i.e. thrilling but totally unbelievable) vehicle pursuit by the Mayans; not here. It's the BELIEVABILITY of ""The Ruins"" that makes it effective, which is reinforced by the acting of the five protagonists.

Speaking of whom, the main cast consists of Jonathan Tucker as Jeff, Laura Ramsey as Stacy, Jena Malone as Amy, Shawn Ashmore as Eric and Joe Anderson as Mathias, the German. The two girls and Tucker (Jeff) especially stand out. I found these protagonists likable and fairly fleshed-out for a 90-minute horror flick. For one, they're not the typical frat trash you see in so many horror flicks. Secondly, we see signs of character again and again, which I detail below.

Critics complain that the antagonists are decidedly un-scary, but that's one of the main points of the movie. Like 1963's ""The Birds,"" it takes something we see every day and are NOT scared of and turns it/them into a source of horror.

One memorable scene is when Stacy and Amy are in the dark bowels of the pyramid searching for a cell phone they keep hearing. What they discover is equal parts shocking, surreal and amazing (more on this below). Another memorable sequence is when Jeff & Eric are forced to perform a gruesome operation. The climax is also well-done and suspenseful.

While the story takes place on the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, it was surprisingly shot at Gold Coast and Tamborine Mountain, Australia, just south of Brisbane, which is on the East coast. In any case, the locations are spectacular.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Ruins"" surprised me in light of the inexplicable mediocre ratings and incessant panning. It's an adventure story mixed with psychological horror utilizing something common and un-scary as the ""monster."" It features quality gore, excellent locations & props, quality performances and proficient filmmaking in general. Plus it takes advantage of the presence of Laura Ramsey and eschews the overdone cartoony-ness of too many horror flicks, which are more funny than creepy or horrifying. In other words, ""The Ruins"" delivers the goods.

The theatrical version runs 90 minutes and the unrated version 93 minutes. I viewed the latter.

GRADE: B+/A-

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)

The plants that live on the pyramid and what they are able to do spur a fascinating point: The animal kingdom spans the spectrum of worms to human beings. What about plant life? The plants at the Mayan ruins are obviously from the higher-developed end of the plant kingdom – they work as a team to obtain sustenance and are able to mimic sounds, like human voices and the ringtone of a cell phone.

I've heard complaints about how the protagonists constantly make the wrong decisions. Answer: The foursome had befriended Mathias and therefore trusted him. They wanted to experience some Mayan history off the beaten track. When the Natives suddenly arrive on the scene and brutally shoot one of their members in the head the only place for them to safely flee is the pyramid. At that point they're stranded because the Natives have the ruins surrounded. How is any of this a wrong decision?

Someone complained that the youths never attempt to escape the pyramid until it is basically too late, which supposedly defies logic. Answer: They're only on the pyramid for two nights and were waiting for help to arrive. Their only other recourse was to make a run for the jungle, which was impossible because the pyramid was surrounded by Natives with deadly weapons who already proved they would kill without mercy anyone infected by the plants. As such, the most logical thing to do was to wait for help and only make a run for it (to the jungle) if they absolutely had to, which is what happens. It sounds logical to me.

Another criticism is that the protagonists are imbeciles with little character development. I found them likable, as noted above, and there are numerous examples of character: They desire to experience the culture of the area and not just utilize their exotic vacation to party, like the average one-dimensional spring-breakers. Also, they refuse to leave Mathias for dead in the pyramid and the girls risk going down the same dubious rope that resulted in his fall. Moreover, Jeff insists on performing the gruesome task of cutting off Mathias' legs and Eric agrees to help even while the primitive operation causes him to vomit. Lastly, Jeff willingly sacrifices himself so that Amy has a chance to escape and she makes a bold dash for freedom. All this sounds like character to me.

Needless to say, the criticisms leveled at the film are mostly invalid or easily explained.",8.0
11153,"<em>'National Lampoon’s Vacation'</em> is a little underwhelming, I thought it was going to be more amusing than it is, though I think there's enough to it that's worth watching. The fun ending with John Candy is what probably nudges this into the rating that I've given.

Chevy Chase is at the forefront of the humour, as anticipated. I would've liked him to a bit more of a bumbling mess than he is, a more dumbed down deadpan delivery would've been more funny. He is shown as an idiot, but not as much as one as the character actually is.

Beverly D'Angelo is good alongside Chase. The kid actors, which notably includes Anthony Michael Hall, are fairly solid in this movie too. The earlier mentioned Candy is alright, he has obviously done far better, and there is also an appearance from Eugene Levy, albeit a fairly tiny one.",7.0
11155,"<em>'Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie’s Island Adventure'</em>... terrible movie, straight up. It only lasts for 82 minutes, but boy is it a rather painful 82 minutes. It was, of course, to be expected, everything about this screams awful and it unfortunately doesn't let you down.

I am someone who didn't enjoy Randy Quaid as Eddie Johnson in the previous flicks, so given he goes from supporting cast to lead actor I was probably always going to dislike this. I'm always open-minded pre-watch though and have been proven wrong before, but not on this occasion.

Elsewhere on the cast, Dana Barron - the original Audrey from the 1983 film - makes a surprise reappearance as Audrey. I only realised after watching that aforementioned film that she was in 2013's <em>'Snow Bride'</em>, a personal favourite Xmas flick; in this I can see Doria in her.

Ed Asner, Fred Willard and Eric Idle - the only true glimmer of light in the very disappointing <em>'National Lampoon's European Vacation'</em> - also feature in this 2003 made-for-television movie. It isn't one I'd call for you to watch, it is this franchise's worst by some distance.",2.0
11156,"Audrey Tautou is actually quite impressive here as the legendary French designer, but the rest of this rather blandly photographed melodrama is really more about her love life than her career. She's born Gabrielle and having left the orphanage in which she was abandoned with sister Adrienne (Marie Gillain), takes a job as a seamstress and supplements that with some cabaret work. Clearly she has skill - at both, but it's her charms at the latter that interest the wealthy Baron Balsan (Benoît Poelvoorde). His name and association opens many doors for this aspiring woman but she tends to look upon him more, to his increasing chagrin, like a brother as she takes a shine to visiting British coal millionaire Arthur ""Boy"" Capel (Alessandro Nivola) who agrees to fund her first millinery enterprise. Like so many of these rags-to-riches biopics, we spend way too long on the childhood and family dynamic before almost accidentally ending up at the how she got her break stuff. We hardly build at all on just how she became the woman she was. Those elements are sparingly portrayed and rushed leaving us with large parts of this drama delivering more of a Merchant Ivory style love triangle, peppered with some ""House of Eliot"" that has more of the soap than the salon to it. That said, Tautou rarely puts a foot wrong and does go some way to convince - despite the over scripting and underwhelming screenplay, and there's an hint of chemistry with Nivola too. It's fine, but sadly - nothing more, and it does little justice to Chanel as a woman or a brand.",6.0

<em>'She-Devil'</em> offers up a pretty simple story but it's one that is portrayed in an amusing and interesting manner. Meryl Streep, Roseanne Barr and Ed Begley Jr. all give top performances, in a film that lasts a brisk 90 or so minutes.

Streep and Barr are the particular standouts, I enjoyed them from the beginning to the end. Begley plays an asshole character very well, much different to my only previous experience if him as a nice guy in television's <em>'Better Call Saul'</em> some 27 years after this. Also neat to see newbie-at-the-time Lori Tan Chinn appear, albeit minutely - always like seeing actors pop up randomly in their early movie roles.",9.0

How can they reduce him back to normal before the lights of Vegas attract him and even more chaos ensues? I suppose it's quite fun to look at things through the eyes of a small child - everything is bright, colourful and an intriguing plaything - but so much of the execution of this reminded me of a 1960s Godzilla film with really quite forced humour emanating from some cringeing performances and some seriously contrived attempts at keeping this from degenerating into a slapstick farce of a film. Moranis worked OK as the family-orientated geek last time around, here there is something almost desperate about his attempts to please. His bosses, his family, us... I think this genre works best when there's something natural to it, we smile or laugh because we want to, not because the director has left convenient moments where someone off-set would hold up a board. I'm not sure this ever really had any sequel value, but this is a feeble attempt I'm afraid and please let's keep ""Wayne"" away from any more gizmos.",5.0
11159,"SECRETS AND LIES is a 1996 film by Mike Leigh that, appropriately enough, is concerned with the things that members of a family conceal from each other.

Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a black woman in London who has made a successful career as an optician, knew from a young age that she was adopted, but only after her adopted mother's death does she decide to look up her birth mother. Hortense is shocked to find that it is Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), not just white but living in near-poverty and wallowing in regret. Cynthia has a tumultuous relationship with her acknowledged daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook), who she fears to be repeating her own youthful mistakes. Cynthia also finds its hard to relate to her brother Maurice (Timothy Spall) and his cold wife Monica (Phyllis Logan), who have done well from a photo shop business. Hortense's entry into this family ultimately shatters their miserable status quo, but not without some heartbreak on the way.

At this point in his career, Mike Leigh had perfected a filmmaking technique by which he had his actors live out their roles in everyday situations in the street for weeks before he started shooting. Consequently, by the time these actors were captured on film, they are totally convincing as their characters, and the characters are fleshed out through the little details that Leigh allowed to bring to them in improvising. The viewer feels that he knows these people deeply. Leigh also has a way of mixing pathos and humour. He not only will insert a comedic shot after a poignant one, but he'll then present ambiguous images where the viewer is unsure whether he should laugh or cry.

While the acting and that dash of humour is quite powerful, there are elements that hold me back from universally praising this film. I've never been impressed by Leigh's use of music, which feels cheap, and only one shot (a deftly timed outdoor barbecue) was truly impressive in its mis-en-scène. And I find Leigh's previous film Naked a slightly more successful application of his art. Still, the acting in SECRETS AND LIES is really something, and I would generally recommend this film.",8.0
11159,"If I ever get around to drawing up a list of my top 25 favorite non-blockbuster movies, Secrets and Lies would roll in very near the top. I have watched it a few times and expect I will continue to do so periodically.

The acting is phenomenal. It is an ensemble cast, for sure, no superstars, but three of the main actors: Timothy Spall, Brenda Blethyn and Claire Rushbrook, are among the best that Great Britain has produced. What I first saw this film, it was literally the first time I had seen those three perform, and I quickly learned to seek them out in other projects. I believe the movie won the top award at the Cannes festival, and Brenda Blethyn won a deserved Academy Oscar award.

The story is a powerful one, and allows for emotional growth in a few of the characters. A few Mike Leigh movies share more than just his favorite repeat performers: they also include a big emotional reveal at the end that really pack a wallop. This movie, Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle, and All or Nothing share that element. I have read that Leigh makes his cast aware of the story but allows them leeway in improvised dialogue, sometimes when he surprises them during filming, but I haven’t studied his technique in any detail.

11159,"**A good work, currently forgotten.**

Just when I think I've seen all sorts of movies about racism, issues of race or prejudice, there's something new that comes out of nowhere, or some meritorious, well-made effort that's worth seeing. This film, initially, seemed to me just a sweet and average drama in which a black woman, very successful, decides to discover the identity of her biological mother and discovers that she is white, and the difficulties and dramas of her family. It was nominated for six Oscars, losing them one by one, but without any demerits.

Observing the film very closely, we can easily verify that it is not a visual or effects spectacle. On a technical level, it's a lukewarm, not to say uninteresting, uninteresting film. Even the soundtrack, which is usually a technical device that even the most regular movies tend to improve on, is pretty forgettable.

Where the film really scores favorably is with regard to the script and direction. It's not a flashy movie, with a complicated or far-fetched story. Things are simple, direct and solid, and the story told is credible, effective. The script, which does not come from the North American milieu in which ethnicity, skin color and financial position seem inseparable, works well with these elements and puts in counterpoint the differences, quite strong, between the mother and the daughter, allowing the public to glimpse the intimacy of those lives. Mike Leigh is a solid director who gives us consistent and remarkable work, visible in a particular care with details, cinematography and work with the actors. And, in fact, the work of the actors is equally remarkable here: Brenda Blethyn gives us one of the most anthological works of his career, the same can be said of Timothy Spall. Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who could and should have more protagonism and attention, is not so lucky and goes much more unnoticed.",6.0

So many movies I'd seen that just deviates slightly from the same storyline and becomes a massive hit, mainly because of the actors or the filmmakers. This one was surprisingly a little fresher from the familiar theme.

It was a road-movie-drama which is very much for family audiences. About spending time together and handling grief. A little emotion, a little adventure, a little fun, gives the overall satisfaction of giving a try. I am glad for watching this little movie, which opens about the family value when you miss your loved one under your arm.

A very simple and sweet movie, merely one line story that expanded just over a 80 minute long. A fine piece of product for the tearjerker.

Emilio Estevez remains the only actor really worth mentioning, the children and villains are very forgettable in this one.

I was expecting an action filled war movie and what I got was a boring movie where the good guys got beaten up at the end. I do not think I even new anything about the real events in Pearl Harbor at the time.

Naturally I view this movie in a somewhat different light and now and when re-watching it yesterday evening I enjoyed it quite a lot. I cannot help but wondering at the historical accuracy though. If someone would have told me that this was nothing but a Hollywood script, and a predictable at that, I would probably not have doubted it.

Did all these blunders really take place? That the Japanese where not playing with all their cards on the table is clear but there where so many screw-ups all over the place. Sightings not being reported, communications a mess everywhere, people asking for confirmations in absurdum, lining up the planes like ducks on a shooting range etc. etc. If this is really what happened then some of those movie scripts that seems so ridiculous maybe are not as ridiculous as one might think?

Naturally the film has the drawback of being predictable. What else can you expect when it is supposed to depict actual, well known, events?

Peeping Tom is directed by Michael Powell and written by Leo Marks. It stars Carl Boehm, Moira Shearer, Anna Massey, Maxine Audley and Brenda Bruce. Music is by Brian Easdale and cinematography by Otto Heller.

A famous (infamous) film for a number of reasons, not least that the fall out from its release effectively finished the career of the great Michael Powell. Interestingly now, still some 50 plus years later, there are still people discovering the film for the first time and not being sure what they have just watched; much like many critics back in 1960 as it happens! While horror seekers quite often come away disappointed that they haven’t seen a Jack the Ripper bloodshed movie. Apparently they see the words serial killer and expect gore and terror on tap.

As fans of the film will attest, Peeping Tom isn’t that sort of serial killer film, it’s a fascinating piece of work. A cunningly crafted observation of a darkened mind, of voyeurism, loneliness and child abuse. From the opening strains of Easdale’s skin itching piano the mood is set, then the brilliantly lurid colour scheme comes into play as troubled Mark Lewis (Boehm) hones in on a victim, a lady of the night about to be filmed in the throes of death. It’s the start of Powell and Marks’ ploy to make us complicit in Lewis’ actions, and then the makers challenge us to sympathise with him as his back story is revealed and also as he struggles with his affections for Helen Stephens (Massey) in the present day.

There is also a sly aside to the movie industry running through the picture, something which no doubt irked critics and film distributors back in 1960. There could maybe be an argument that the trauma and psychological thematics at work that underpin the plot are a little dated now? But what is still relevant is the film making – voyeurism angle as we today are constantly fed reality TV for entertainment purpose. The production is across the board grade “A”, the performances highly effective, with the unfairly maligned Boehm perfect as Lewis, the actor even providing shadings of Peter Lorre at times. Heller’s bold colour photography is disgustingly atmospheric, Easdale’s music a stalking menace and the sound department really come up trumps. Perfect.

Then of course there is Powell himself, deeply hurt by the savaging he received when Tom was released, it’s nice to note that before he passed away in 1990 he would see the film become a highly regarded piece of film making. It and he deserves praise, his direction is conceptually daring, his framing of Lewis methodical, and of course his camera is our eyes and ears, uncomfortably so.

11167,"I can recall being genuinely scared when I first saw this film in the early 1970s. Young women are being found murdered. What makes their crimes especially heinous is the look of sheer terror found on their faces - and that is what is further perplexing the pursing Scotland Yard detective ""Gregg"" (Jack Watson). Meantime, actress ""Vivian"" (Moira Shearer) is filming her new movie and on the set is the camera-obsessed ""Mark"" (Karlheinz Böhm) who rents out the bottom part of his sprawling house to a group of youngsters. Usually keeping himself to himself, he is befriended by ""Helen"" (Anna Massey) and soon a relationship, of sorts, develops as she takes an interest in both him and his films. When tragedy occurs at the studio, the police investigation initially includes the sound stage crew, and gradually the plot unfolds in a dark and menacing fashion. Böhm and Massey are great here and under Michael Powell and Otto Heller's creative direction and photography, deliver us an intimate and well paced story that takes it's time, but does so in a cumulatively effective fashion. The dialogue is disarmingly potent too - there is something almost childlike about ""Mark"" and almost maternal about ""Massey"", illustrative of the underlying psychology of the story.

Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Fred J. Koenekamp.

Pic is a part biography of George S. Patton Jr. which follows his exploits in WWII until his retirement from service.

Released at the time of the Vietnam War, there's a certain bravado in the makers choosing this period to release a biopic about one of America's most famous - and controversial - military characters. Led by a tour de force performance by Scott as Patton, Shaffner and his team rightly portray the man as full of flag waving bluster, gigantic egotism and majestic tenderness. The complexity of the man in Scott's hands is what drives the film to greater heights.

Schaffner's (Planet of the Apes) shows a smart eye for battle scene construction (shot in 70 millimetre - Dimension 150), this puts us viewers right in amongst the horrors of warfare.

A US cavalry officer, he fought in the First World War and is one of the biggest names in the development of tanks and armored cars, both at the level of conception and strategy, where he valued rapid movements and aggressiveness. In World War II, he led Operation Torch, faced the German general Rommel and openly competed with Montgomery, who was more prudent in his approach. But he also blatantly ignored superior orders and assaulted soldiers who did not appear committed, so he was harshly censured and only recovered after the Battle of the Ardennes, when he supported the Allied forces.

I think I can join most people in saying that the strong point here is the very solid performance of George C. Scott: he was extraordinarily convincing in the role of the “Bandit” (one of the many barracks nicknames that Patton collected). He effortlessly steals all the attention and is a more than solid protagonist, to which we can add a consistent and competent supporting cast, featuring the worthy Karl Malden and Michael Bates.

Expertly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, the film features a magnificent script. I'm a historian, but I'm not an expert on the period in question and, therefore, I'm not the right person to evaluate the film's historical realism. However, I can say that I didn't see any glaring errors. The cinematography is very colorful and bright, making the most of the excellent sets, costumes and filming locations, which reproduce very well the settings and environments. However, if what you want is a war film with a lot of action, I have doubts about recommending this one: there isn't much here, except for some good fights. The film did well in the market, was profitable, and the critics were very receptive. In 1971, it won seven of the ten Oscars for which it was nominated, namely Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor (for Scott, who refused to accept it for not agreeing with the competition) and Best Film.",9.0

For 13 days these brave men hold the fort...

The Alamo is not the film it should be, even after the 2004 remake (a great film that takes a reflective and thoughtful stance) we find ourselves still waiting for a blood pumping and stirring take on the folklore tale of what happened at the small missionary known as The Alamo. It's San Antonio, 1836 and General Santa Anna is marching his mighty armies into the contested territory of Texas, all that stands in his way is a small band of heroes, Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett and their trusty men who are led by the inexperienced William Travis. They must buy time in order for General Sam Houston to get an army together in which to crush Santa Anna's imposing forces.

There really is no simpler way of putting it other than to say that The Alamo is an overlong misfire. Various cuts have been made to try and create an epic classic out of what was actually filmed, but neither of the cuts can succeed in making it the flowing genre piece it could have been. John Wayne directs and clearly cared about the project (with his own cash invested that was to be expected), but rumours have persisted that Cliff Lyons had to take up directing duties later in the picture, it's not hard to see why if that was the case, but various sources do poo poo this rumour, and is mostly believed to be Wayne's own work throughout the film. Wayne (having learnt from his mentor John Ford) had a great vision for the picture, and the scope is rather impressive, the recreation of The Alamo building in particular is first rate, whilst the formations of Santa Anna's armies finally rouse the picture out of its slumber.

However, the high points in the picture are few and far between, the acting leaves a lot to be desired, with Wayne himself unable to let the Crockett character be anything other than the John Wayne show. Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie steadily holds his own and manages to eek out a bit of bravado interplay with Wayne and Laurence Harvey (William Travers), but outside of that there is not much to write home about. The final third just about saves the film from being a stinker, with the Academy Award for best sound richly deserved, but sadly The Alamo remains to this day a plodding dinosaur that bores when it really should be igniting the spirit. 5/10",5.0

I saw this movie for the first time a good few years ago, but I only decided to talk about it now, after seeing it again. For me, it is one of the best Italian films ever made. It's like a modern fairy tale, showing us the fascinating side of cinema and reminding us why we love it. Of course, everything passes, and cinema has gone through many phases, it has undergone metamorphoses, and the end of the great classic movie theaters was one of them. And now? The pandemic has shown us that cinema can learn to survive without its theaters. And if we consider the manufacture of televisions and sound systems increasingly “cinematic” and economically viable? Will the living room one day be our own private movie theater, with all the comfort and quality of the big screen?

The future is anyone's guess, and it's as wonderful as it is frightening, but let's put these digressions aside. Anyone who likes cinema should see this film. It has a good dose of nostalgia, it can move the audience (it moves me) and makes us think about life. It's a little difficult to explain, I think it's one of those films that manages to touch something personal in whoever sees it, and that's not easy to translate onto paper because no two lives are alike. It is also worth going to see the various films that appear on the screens of Paradise, and which are very fair tributes to several well-known films.

The cast has very strong names. It is one of the best films of Phillippe Noiret's career, which offers us such a good job that he could well have been nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor that year. Young Salvatore Cascio also does an excellent job and is believable in his role. Enzo Cannavale and Marco Leonardi also do an excellent job. Tornatore's steering is virtually flawless.

Technically, the film is equally remarkable: in addition to accurately recreating the times in which everything takes place, it perfectly shows the technical evolution of cinema, and the way in which the place itself – Giancaldo – changes over time. The choice of filming locations was careful, all the work with props, costumes and sets was meticulous, and the cinematography is very beautiful. The edition does not deserve any repairs, especially if we are talking about the extended version of the film. Ennio Morricone, with his work in this film, gives us one of the best soundtracks of his career, every melody is worth listening to.",10.0

11220,"The complimentary movie to Chungking Express (1994), this is a neo-noir thriller that was shooted as a different movie because of the length of the total movie and differences between the two.

As in the first this one also tells two stories: of a hitman (Leon Lai Ming) that wants to detach from his activities and his partner, a woman that cleans his apartment while he is out, and have a secret love for him, while he meets another girl nicknamed blondie. 

The second one is from a ex-convict escaped from prison, Ho Chi-mo (Takeshi Kaneshiro) that is mute and works and lives with his father, also breaking into other works at night to sell their goods and services (here we have a meet with the Chungking Express with the first movie) and keeps finding another girl Charlie that lost his girlfriend for blondie), aside from a sequence that he meets another character from the first story in the end.

While having its themes along with Chungking, it differentiates from he first one by the use of cinematographer Christopher Doyle shooting mainly at night and using extreme wide-angle lenses, keeping the camera as close to the talents as possible to give a detached effect from the world around them, giving an wide-angle distortion of images creates an effect of distance-in-proximity, conveying the characters' solitude. 

The visuals are frantic, out-of-focus, and neon-lit. The camera also follows the characters and segments of B&W and heldcam camera also are used.

Another difference is the use of voice overs (as in thoughts) in the place of dialogues and pop songs this time mainly Cantonese versions of many musics, some of them also being ocidental (like the instrumental ""Speak My Language"" by American avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson and  Flying Pickets version of ""Only You"" by member Vince Clarke, while he was still with Depeche Mode).

The villains are meh, a little iffy but fine... far better than those from <em>'The Karate Kid Part III'</em>, that's for sure.

In my opinion, it's the best sequel to 1984's <em>'The Karate Kid'</em>. That's a big surprise, considering the downward trajectory of the preceding two.

11231,"**Despite the heavy reviews and the public's disinterest, it's not as bad a movie as they say, and it was able to end the franchise on a positive note.**

After three very interesting films, the “Karate Kid” franchise had to continue, and a fourth film was made, this time with a young girl in place of the apprentice (Ralph Macchio was too old for the character, and he had no interest in calling more his image and career to the universe of martial arts films). It was a risky move, but necessary if they wanted the franchise to continue... but the public didn't buy in, despite the movie itself not being as bad as they say. In fact, I even consider it to be better than its immediate predecessor. With a weak box office result, largely as a result of the public's loss of interest in karate films, the film killed the franchise for a few decades, but I have no doubt that it was able to end it on a positive note.

The script is simple, but not without its flaws: Miyagi attends a military ceremony honoring the dead of his military unit, and ends up meeting the daughter of an ex-comrade-in-arms, Julie. She is a withdrawn young woman, with problems and angry due to the death of her parents in an accident. He decides to take her as a karate apprentice, it being obvious that she has a series of problems with other violent teenagers and will have to use martial arts to defend herself, but predictability is an agenda present throughout the film, which is not brings anything substantially new to the franchise. The film basically contains the same ideas and structure as its predecessors. The end of the movie is pretty hard to believe.

Despite the problems, the film brings back Pat Morita, who has already won us over with the friendliness and good humor of his character, and with an always very committed interpretation. He has always been fundamental to the success of the films in this franchise, and his funny and charismatic presence is even more important here, in a film where he assumes even more presence and protagonism. Hillary Swank is still extremely young in this film and is a long way from the glory days she will live in years to come, but she shows charisma and presence, and a latent talent that needs to be polished. The film also has the participation of Michael Ironside and Michael Cavalieri, in the role of the two main villains, both of which are predictable, flat and underdeveloped, but still worthy of our dislike.

Technically, it is a very discreet film, which invests more in discreet effects and in a clear sound and image than in more flashy things. The movie's pacing is slower than its predecessors, and that takes some of the fun out of the movie, makes it more sleepy, but it's not a serious problem. The cinematography and editing are good enough, as are the choice of filming locations, the design of the sets (in particular the monastery) and the costumes. Finally, but just as importantly, the action and fight scenes were good enough and very well choreographed, and while some thought they were too sparse, I thought they were more interesting than the two preceding films in the franchise.",6.0
11231,"Well, let's be honest, this one does clean up the problematic white patriarchy exhibited in the three other films, but it still stereotypes Asian people as....

....I fooled you didn't I? Yeah, I'm not at all one of those people.

Whatever, no one is going to read this anyway.

I do, however, feel the need to give this two stars on principle. I mean, I did remember that they made this film when Part III was (possibly) blocked from my memory to save myself the horror of it all... but that I don't think it deserves that.

When I was a kid, actually a Freshman in High School, I kind of had the attitude that no Ralph Macchio meant it wasn't a real Karate Kid film. I'd rather not see it made and I went out of my way not to watch it until I caught it on cable.

I'd like to think I've matured since, but they are rebooting Blade and...no Snipes. The same attitude applies. I guess I haven't grown.

At any rate, it's not just the lack of Macchio, it's the addition of Ironside doing his absolutely best impersonation of Michael Ironside and over-acting to the point where I'm actually shocked the rest of the cast made it through without groaning. He's kind of like Nicholas Cage without the charisma isn't he?

Moving on, Swank does an OK job of selling it physically. I mean, I'm a pretty big guy, I was certainly a big guy in High School, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that she could kick my behind from here to kingdom come. Unfortunately, as much as she does sell the physicality of the role, it doesn't take a trained eye to see she doesn't know the fundamentals of even a basic street brawl.

She made up for it later in here career, but it still leaves you with the impression that she never threw a real punch in her life.

But once the story kicks on, the plot wears thin and drifts off into horror conventions purely as a means to up the entertainment value of the piece. 

It's also not helped by a quite ludicrous score from Ron Grainer, even allowing for the 70s nature of production, it's jaunty when it should be menacing and detracts from the darker moments of the story. Heston does fine, and easily carries the picture well enough to keep it from mundane average hell, but once the final credits role and the ending sinks in, you kind of feel you have been cheated out of a good movie, which is sad because it promised so very much early on. 6/10 (mainly for the first half).",6.0

But, it didn't age well and probably wasn't the highest budget to start with.

11234,"**_'Taylor' in a bad movie_**

There was something about Charlton Heston that made him perfect for the role of Taylor in ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes,"" two of the greatest sci-fi/adventure flicks of all time. So it's no wonder that the producers of 1971's ""Omega Man"" chose Heston for what is essentially the same role in this film about the supposedly last man on earth living in L.A. after a war waged with biological weapons (loosely based on a book by Richard Matheson). Unfortunately the third time's definitely not the charm and the film holds little interest beyond an early 70s period piece or nostalgia.

I remember catching ""Omega Man"" sometime several years ago and expecting a great early 70s sci-fi flick with a great protagonist and all I remember was being extremely disappointed and (I think) not even finishing it. Well, I decided to give it another chance, fully braced for an underwhelming experience, and my original impressions were pretty accurate.

The film starts off well with Taylor, I mean Neville (Heston,) wandering around a deserted Los Angeles, muttering to himself, watching ""Woodstock"" for the 100th time, etc. but the horribly dated 'hip' score is the first bad sign and then night comes down and these cloaked albino vampire-zombies appear, which is what turned me off the first time I caught the film. Just listen to their dialogue. I wanted to run away in horror, and not in the good way.

But, from there, I hoped, that the film would settle into its own groove, as long as I overlooked the bad music and corny villains or just accepted them as a part of this period oddity. ""Omega Man"" does settle into a groove, it's just that it's not all that engrossing. And what's up with Heston taking off his shirt every 8 minutes? The flashbacks to how this apocalyptic scenario originated were interesting, as well as Neville's run-ins with others, but the film never rises above the mediocre and heavily dated.

One might argue that ""dated"" is an unjust criticism given the film's age, but all good or great films are able to transcend their eras even while clearly being from their eras, like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""King Kong,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" ""Runaway Train"" and ""The Blue Max."" ""The Omega Man"" miserably fails to accomplish this.

Overall the film feels more like a mediocre made-for-TV flick than a theatrical release of its time. It almost has the look and feel of the original ""Star Trek"" series, but without the great writing and characters. The albino villains with their dark hoods and cloaks are reminiscent of the 'villains' in the episode ""The Return of the Archons."" The average Syfy flick is more interesting. But it has its points of interest: a black female protagonist (Rosalind Cash), a worthy sidekick of sorts (Paul Koslo) and the desolate scenes of L.A., but its main appeal is as a period piece.

This is one of those indie films that has won over a legion of self-confessed admirers. It's a film that everyone speaks highly of, as if it were a solid masterpiece. I didn't know that when I saw it for the first time, so I saw it without a lot of expectations. I'm glad I did it: despite recognizing some merits, I am convinced that the film has been well overrated. The proof is the way it fell into oblivion! If we exclude fans and movie nerds who know everything (and when they don't, they make it up) who really remembers this movie?

The film revolves around a story that is very simple: in the north of Scotland, there is a small bay with a beach and a sleepy village. When a rich oil entrepreneur decides to buy all that to build a huge refinery and a terminal for oil tankers, all those people are expectant, wanting to sell what they have for the best price. Only two people disagree: a marine biologist who want to preserve and study the local, and an old simpleton who owns a good part of that beach.

The film had some potential, but it lacks solidity and a good script. Time is spent in sterile dialogue, rambling about comets, constellations and flirting. It is also very unbelievable, as a project like this would never be so consensual, there are always those who oppose it for financial or ecological reasons, or mere nostalgia.

If director Bill Forsyth decided to close his eyes to the insipidity and fragility of the script, he was equally inept at using the actors. The cast is good, but he didn't know how to use it. Peter Riegert does what he can, but he has absolutely no charisma and is a forgettable protagonist, who seems more uncomfortable with his character than his character with fieldwork, far from the comforts of the office. Peter Capaldi doesn't do it better, and Jenny Seagrove is just a pretty face here. Fulton Mackay manages to give us something more substantial, but he has little screen time, and the same can be said of poor Burt Lancaster, who is removed from the screen for a good time.

A disjointed script, insipid dialogues purposely created to fill up time, characters without strength and ability to captivate us… could there be something in the technical aspects that saves this film? Yes. The cinematography is very good, making the best use of the beauties of the Highlands. The sets and costumes are quite good, and the soundtrack is atmospheric and pleasant.

To be honest, I remember seeing previews of this movie way back when it came out (in 1993) and thinking to myself, ""WHY would anyone want to see such a film and why would anyone make it?"" Well, about five years later it appeared on TV one night and I started watching, fully expecting to turn it off within 20 minutes or so. WOW -- was I ever wrong!

What I saw was beautiful and captivating, artistic and entrancing -- filmmaking of the highest order. ""The Secret Garden"" is a movie of such artistic quality that it ranks up there with the hallowed original ""Apocalypse Now"" (although they're totally different genres). It's no surprise that Francis Ford Coppola had his hand in both pics -- he was, of course, the director of ""Apocalypse Now"" and he's the executive producer of ""The Secret Garden.""

In any event, the cinematography is breathtaking and the score is awe-inspiring, ranking with the best in cinematic history.

***PLOT SPOILER***

The story's about a spoiled 10-year old English girl, orphaned in India, who comes home to live on her uncle's vast estate in the early 1900s. The girl, Mary, finds herself trapped in a mysterious, colossal manor -- almost a castle -- tyrannically managed by a life-stifling witch, Mrs. Medlock, in the frequent absence of her uncle, Lord Cravin. Because Mary is intelligent, independent and sly she is able to reconnoiter the manor and learn its forbidding secrets. The biggest secret is that her aunt died ten years earlier and her son, Colin, still lives there, albeit confined to a bed, sickly and unable to walk. Her uncle never healed from this heartbreak.

Mary discovers another secret in her explorations, a hidden garden, closed off and neglected since her aunt's death. After meeting the sickly and sad Colin, Mary inevitably finds a way to sneak him into the garden along with her pal Dickon. She senses that Colin isn't as sick as everyone is convinced; she knows the best thing would be to get him out of the dreary castle and the oppressive clutches of Mrs. Medlock. Mary and her secret garden are the keys to restoring health, life and freedom to Colin, Lord Cravin and the gloomy manor.

***END SPOILER***

""The Secret Garden"" is sort of a 1990's version of the outstanding ""Pollyanna"" with Hayley Mills (1960). Both pics involve a young girl restoring a spirit of joy and liberty to a lifeless community. The difference is that Mary is not even remotely the ""glad girl"" Pollyanna. In fact, look for the hilarious line from the old gardener who responds to Mary's puzzlement concerning her lack of friends.

""The Secret Garden"" is no doubt labeled a ""children's film,"" which is a shame because it transcends such a limiting category. The ending's too quaint for my tastes but, nevertheless, this is a beautiful work of wonder and deep mystery, which can be enjoyed by people of all ages -- children and adults.

11238,"""Aladdin and the King of Thieves"" serves as the third installment in the Aladdin franchise, predating the live-action adaptation. Despite my deep affection for Aladdin and Jasmine, this animated film falls short and undermines the franchise's outstanding qualities.

While the storyline introduces Aladdin's father, adding an interesting layer to the narrative, the animation quality leaves much to be desired. The visuals come across as subpar, reminiscent of content from the Disney Channel rather than a theatrical release.

Despite its flaws, I appreciate this chapter in Aladdin's story and the continuation of the characters' journeys. The inclusion of Aladdin's father and the development of other villains enrich the overall narrative. While I cherish the Aladdin story and its expansion, from a cinematic perspective, this particular installment falls short.

Shifting focus to the Aladdin television series, I find it remarkable that viewers were able to further explore the characters beyond the original films. The series provided an opportunity to delve into various storylines and adventures, offering a more in-depth look at the beloved characters.

11247,"""A Cinderella Story"" has become an iconic franchise, with the version starring Hilary Duff standing out as a standout favorite. While Duff's portrayal alongside Chad Michael Murray brought a modern twist to the classic tale of Cinderella, subsequent installments in the franchise have failed to live up to the same standard.

The franchise seems to be struggling to recapture the magic of the original film, instead resorting to unnecessary side stories and deviations from the core Cinderella narrative. It appears that attempts to replicate the success of the Walt Disney and Roger and Hammerstein versions have fallen short, leading to a sense of fatigue and irrelevance surrounding the franchise.

Despite the star power of Selena Gomez in ""Another Cinderella Story,"" the film failed to reach the heights set by Hilary Duff's portrayal. Similarly, Lucy Hale's ""A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song"" was criticized for its lackluster execution and departure from the essence of the Cinderella story.

""Sofia Carson's ""A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits"" attempted to capitalize on dance elements reminiscent of ""Grease,"" but ultimately fell flat, marking a low point in the franchise. Laura Marano's ""A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish"" was deemed the weakest link in the series, solidifying the downward trend in quality.

As the franchise continues with new installments, the lackluster reception of recent films has dampened enthusiasm for further entries in the series. Viewers may find it challenging to engage with future releases given the disappointing trajectory of the franchise.",5.0

Filmmakers have learned that just modernizing the original with a bigger budget takes no creativity and falls into tedium and redundancy which most horror fan's hate. Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake, where nearly every scene is ""copied exactly,"" is a perfect example of this.

It was simply BORING. Even for those that never saw this first, the pacing is just too slow for the high-octane generations of the 90's and beyond. For a re-make to resonate with an audience that knows the original by heart, it has to deliver a new and different version while staying within the bounds of the original framework. We should be thankful because no director will try this again. For the secret formula to successful horror re-makes, watch 2012's The Evil Dead, 2004's Dawn of the Dead or David Cronenberg's The Fly (1986).",2.0

11257,"**A film that seems to be more concerned with criticizing the manners of the 19th century than with telling us a good story.**

The film is set in the early years of the 20th century and is a romantic story that begins when a young British girl stays in a guesthouse in Florence among other English tourists. The room she received does not have a view over the River Arno, so she agrees to exchange with a young man, with progressive and daring ideas, who will win her heart. When they return to England, the get-together is inevitable. I haven't read the book this film is based on, but I believe those who say the adaptation is respectful. Written by James Ivory, it won three Oscars (Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction and Best Adapted Screenplay) and was also nominated for other awards (Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Film). However, if we think about it, almost no one remembers it nowadays, except for big cinema fans.

As a romantic film, it works and fits into that cliché of couples who break conventions to experience love, a utopia that leaves the majority of the female audience daydreaming. It's not a bad story, but we know where it will end. There is a profound anachrony underlying the film. It is not visible in the production itself, which is luxurious and expensive, with excellent sets, makeup, hairstyles, costumes and intelligently selected props. However, watching the film calmly, we detect the anachrony in the way in which British society at the time was portrayed: etiquette, good manners and social conventions appear as “castrating” love and passions, when in fact few people in that society overvalued love in the same way we do. This must be in the original book, of course, but it is still a “black and white” vision of a past that is judged in the light of our eyes. Despite this, it deserves clear praise for the sets, costumes and props, for its magnificent cinematography, where warm colors and the most touristic landscapes and places in Florence (one of the most beautiful in Europe) stand out, and for an excellent soundtrack, solidly based on classical and lyrical pieces that may, or may not, be recognized by the public.

However, what stands out in the film and gives it greater value is the extraordinary performance by a luxurious cast full of strong, talented and well-known names. A very particular ovation is justified by the work of Helena Bonham Carter, in her debut in the seventh art, marking the start of her great career in cinema. Equally incredible was the chameleonic Daniel Day-Lewis, who gave us an affected and pompous gentleman who gave soul and grace. Maggie Smith is always a safe bet, especially when she plays characters within her “comfort zone”, but I found her somewhat dull. Denholm Elliott is very good, but not incredible as Julian Sands, who has one of the central roles in the plot. He was one of those actors who would have done better by spending a little more time working in Europe before trying his luck in the USA. He was very good, but he lacked opportunities in the land where they supposedly appear. Allow me to make an aside: in one of those strange coincidences in life, I saw this film yesterday and just now saw, at the Oscars ceremony, this actor's name in memoriam by having passed away in 2023. What more can I say? Rest in peace.",5.0

11281,"**An honorable continuation, which respects the previous work without bringing anything new.**

I don't like Halloween, and I've had time to say it before, but I recognize that it's the best time for good horror films to be broadcast on television. These days, I saw this film as a follow-up to “Halloween”. I have no doubt that it is a worthy sequel, perhaps one of the best I have seen, in that it is strictly faithful to the original and is made with quality.

It is directed by Rick Rosenthal, but the team and cast remained the same, with the addition of specific names, and John Carpenter's inspiration continues in the script he wrote and in the attention he undoubtedly gave to the entire project. Pleasance is the actor who looks in the best shape here. He finally had better material and more time to show some value on stage. Jamie Lee Curtis has essentially stayed the same and retains much of what he did. It doesn't disappoint, but it doesn't bring any surprises either. The soundtrack also doesn't bring anything new, maintaining the essence of the first film's score, which is positive.

After its initial success, it is no wonder that this film's budget was more substantial than that of the first, and that the number of corpses that fall throughout the plot also increases. A plot that is not particularly brilliant, well written and elegant, and that falls into the most basic clichés of slasher horror without any shame, but that manages, at least, to respect coherence with the original film and give the villain an almost iconic aura, an invulnerability that makes him unstoppable and impossible to kill, and that turned him into a cinema icon. In addition to these points of relative quality, we also have good lighting and cinematography, good use of sets and filming locations, better quality effects that are as well executed and practical as those previously used. Everything comes together, therefore, to form the image of a film that is not surprising, but manages to respect and stand alongside its predecessor.",5.0

John Cho and Kal Penn work amazingly together, so much so that I'm honestly surprised there isn't a web series of ""Harold and Kumar"" skits (and if there are, then happy day) trying to wring blood from stone.

The story has a great structure: a clear antagonist, clear love interest, a goal, plenty of adversity, and lots of quality character interaction.

The problem with the content is that it's a series of ever increasing ridiculous events.  The continuity suffers a bit, but its done so well that it feels seemless in the moment.

11285,"**Lazy, laying in the shadow of the original film, doesn't have much merit in itself.**

Daniel Petrie decided to take a film that was successful and acquired a certain affection and make a poor sequel. I think almost everyone knows that a sequel to a good movie is almost never as good as the original movie... it could be a cliché, but the truth is that it is something so common that it has become something to watch. Besides, for studios, it's a good way to make money without considerable effort or a big capital draw.

What this film offers us is, in short, more of the same, but without any charm. The film leans against the shadow of the predecessor's success and peacefully slumbers in the belief that we will like it because we liked the first film. It didn't work for me. The only thing that makes this movie really worthwhile is the fact that it reunites most of its predecessor's cast. It's worth seeing some of the shenanigans of Don Ameche, Wilford Brimey, Maureen Stapleton and Jack Gilford. You can tell they're having a lot of fun with the project, and that the film, even if it's not brilliant, allowed them to revisit characters they enjoyed playing. The movie works reasonably well thanks to this, and the older cast almost have their own separate sub-plot, but the movie loses out by not going beyond that, thanks to a rather weak script. Steve Guttenberg, for example, is even more uninteresting here than he was in the original film, which is really something relevant. Technically, the film doesn't make any major mistakes or flaws, but it isn't particularly brilliant.",3.0

A synch, surely? They are not the only contestants, though, and Roger Moore is also intent on a bit of debonaire skulduggery with his very own Aston Martin - yep, that very one; whilst a couple of priests in a red Ferrari (Sammy Davis Jr. & Dean Martin) do their utmost to ""bless"" their way to the winning post. It's a star-studded affair with Peter Fonda; an entertaining, if fleetingly used, Jackie Chan and Farah Fawcett all in there too to complement some scene stealing scenes from permanently out of it doctor ""Van Helsing"" - Jack Elam, but the story soon starts to tire as it becomes a sort of live-action version of ""Whacky Races"" tinged with a few ""Carry On"" double-entendres. The ""Rat Pack"" contingent look like they are just along for the fee and Fawcett adds little but her usual degree of fluffiness as the damsel not really in distress. It's not a patch on ""Smokey and the Bandit"" (1977) though there are some fairly obvious cop-baiting similarities and by the end it has largely fizzled out.

It's 1943 and Baseball in the states has been decimated by all the men being called up to join the services. Enter the ladies who themselves help to kick start a womens league to keep the Baseball fires burning.

The first thing any prospective first time viewer of this piece should note, is that it's not actually a film about Baseball. It's about friendships, challenges and differing off shoots to the complications of war, it just so happens that it's the game of Baseball that brings it all together! 

Directed by Penny Marshall (Big), screenplay by Lowell Ganz & Babaloo Mandel (City Slickers/Parenthood) and featuring Tom Hanks (wonderful as drunken coach Dugan) as the leading male, it's no surprise that ""A League Of Their Own"" booms with sentiment and no little amount of comedy. It is to me a very rewarding picture, the sort that wants you to chuckle along with it whilst noting the need for human interaction during a troubled time. 

The lady actors do great impressions of bona fide athletes, asked to parade in short skirts and entertain the watching public, these gals, led by the always engaging Geena Davis, deliver a sparky picture that never veers into maudlin territory. There are of course some sombre moments, but they are placed nicely by Marshall in the context of the films' events, never trite, they serve more as tender vignettes to run alongside the frivolity on offer.

 Ultimately ""A League Of Their Own"" has achieved its aims come the final credits, its not taxing and its not purporting to be an intelligent look at a period in history.

Father and daughter Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, under Peter Bogdanovich's superlative direction, produce one of the most affectingly warm and cunningly sly movies of the 1970s. Set in depression era America and beautifully photographed in pristine monochrome by Laszlo Kovacs, it's a period piece that refuses to get old, such is the deft imagery and sharpness of the screenplay.

Story essentially comes down to conman Moses Pray (R. O'Neal) hooking up with orphan Addie Loggins (T. O'Neal), who may or may not be his actual daughter. Addie proves to be a precocious live wire, not easily fooled and she smokes, cusses and is more than capable of pulling a con herself. After initial indignation, Moses comes to court Addie's strengths and they form a dynamic partnership as they travel through Kansas, pulling cons left right and centre and piling the money up. But can it last forever?

The chemistry between father and daughter is obviously set in stone, with young Tatum an absolute revelation. The screenplay gives them both ample opportunities to enchant and amuse the viewer as they get up to all sorts of tricks and scrapes. Yet there's always that feeling hanging in the dusty air that something has to give, that we are treading firmly in bittersweet territory, the crafty couple having earned our complete investment in their well being keeping us concerned even as we laugh out loud.

In the name of good television, newswoman Karen White (Dee Wallace) forms a bond with serial killer Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo). But when the meeting of the two arrives, it nearly proves fatal and damages Karen psychologically. Her psychologist recommends that she spend some time with her husband out at a remote convalescence resort, but once there it appears all is not as it seems.

A truly great Werewolf movie, one of the best in fact, The Howling - in some eyes - has lost some of its bite over the years due to countless sequels and imitators, but its importance never dims. It often gets forgotten that The Howling changed the werewolf DNA for the better, it invented its own hairy beast as it were, refusing to copy past treasures from the olde classic era. But director Joe Dante shows the utmost respect to those who had previously eaten at the Lycan table, naming many of the characters in his film after directors of Werewolf movies. Nice.

Another thing forgotten, due in no part to the release of An American Werewolf in London later in the year, is that Dante's movie often has tongue in bloody cheek. It is happy to be a parody of the sub-genre of horror it loves, while some of the comedy visuals are deliciously and knowingly dry. But this is a horror film after all, and it so delivers in spades the frights and nervous tremors, even sexing things up as well. These Werewolves are completely bestial, and in human form enjoy having their secret other halves. This is just a colony at the moment but domination of all humans is most definitely appealing and on the agenda.

Horror fans will sometimes stumble across a debate about effects wizards Rob Bottin and Rick Baker, who is best? It really doesn't matter, both are geniuses of their craft. Bottin is in the chair here, while Baker served as a consultant before doing his thing on An American Werewolf in London. The transformation sequences are superb and still hold up today as brilliant craft work, no CGI cheap tactics here. No sir. The Howling is scary, sexy and funny, and knowing Dante - maybe even political. A joyous Werewolf film whose impact on horror should always be respected. 9/10",10.0

Venturing into the woods might offer her the only opportunity to finally put her fears to bed - but there is a risk, and that risk might still involve the man she knows to be already dead! The story here is quite good - and the audio effects department do well to develop and sustain quite a decent sense of menace as ""Karen"" finds herself in her new, remote and creepy, home. The acting, though - well Wallace just isn't very good, nor is ""Avengers"" regular, and not terribly versatile, Patrick Macnee who comes across very much as a fish out of water as the supernatural elements take over and the quality of the film falls away. The use of dialogue in the latter part of the film is sparing, and that is more effective as the darkness, shadowing and Pino Donaggio score do engender some sense of peril but I just wanted a better, more engaged, cast.

I've heard of this film as a documentary, but I honestly don't know if Godfrey Reggio really wanted to document anything. This was the director's debut, and for a first work we can say that there is quality, even though it is a somewhat strange film because it has nothing more than a soundtrack and successive images, which do not seem to have a relationship with each other.

If this is an experimental film, I also can't understand what this director really wanted to experiment with. Making a film without a script and without a story? Honestly, this film looks a lot like those successive images that are sometimes shown in waiting rooms, for whoever is sitting there. And what about the film's title? I honestly thought it was some Croatian or Balkan film before I read something about the film and ventured out to see it. Only then did I discover that it was a term from the Hopi language, and that it means living in an unbalanced way.

Without a defined script, without any actor, without a spoken word (the title is sung in a threatening Gregorian tone at the beginning and at the end, but I consider this part of the soundtrack pure and simple), we just see all the images and the sound of the music. In short, the film seems like a mute critique of the modern way of life, in contrast to what was lived in the past, before industrialization. It's what I think. And a good movie? It will be good as an introduction to the environmental debate, as a reflection film. For the general public who are not interested in debating these issues, it is not worth it.",1.0

From some of the most impressive features nature created over millennia to some almost as remarkable creations mankind has erected in a tiny percentage of that time.

At times it borders on the soporific, but for the most part it goes hand in hand with some cleverly edited imagery depicting how we can be complementary to our planet and how we can be downright hostile to it. A great deal of creative care has gone into the chronology and the photography here as light, shadow, clouds, glass and some effective time-lapse cinematography shows an evolution of the natural, the industrial and the destructive. You do have to wonder if we’d only take greater care of what we have created and live in  a less disposable society, then so much of what we see here that is excessive could be eradicated and our place within the environment of the planet less devastating. It’s a surprisingly effortless watch for ninety minutes and maybe if more saw it, it’s powerful message of striving for greater compatibility might have more impact.

11322,"**Dillinger, an iconic bandit in a respectful and well-made film.**

There is no shortage of quality films about Prohibition and the many notable criminals of this era in American history: Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel and others form a kind of “golden age” of organized crime. John Dillinger is among them, occupying a top place on the list of great criminals of this era.

After a rebellious and delinquent youth, Dillinger deserted the Navy and ended up being sentenced to almost twenty years in prison after a grocery store robbery. The sentence was considered excessively heavy and left Dillinger resentful. From then on, he made the Indiana State Penitentiary his school of crime until he was released in 1933. With his freedom, he formed his first gang and began the bank robberies that made him famous. In 1934, he was arrested in Arizona and sent to Crown Point, Indiana, from where he made a spectacular escape, using a fake pistol made from a bar of soap or wood. His escape, the notoriety he had already acquired and the interstate nature of his crimes led to the involvement of the recently founded FBI. Meanwhile, Dillinger formed a second group of criminals which included the equally famous “Baby-Face” Nelson, and resumed his robberies, while trying to elude the authorities. Months later, and after almost being arrested on several occasions, he was betrayed and denounced, and murdered outside a cinema.

The film is quite good. It is faithful enough to the events and to Dillinger's life, but mixes things up a bit, changing the order of events in order to increase dramatic tension (for example, the death of “Pretty Boy” Floyd is shown well before Dillinger's death , but it happened months later, in a corn field). Furthermore, the film exaggerates things. However, these are concessions that I accept because the film, in addition to being a fictional piece, is reasonably respectful of historical facts. I don't accept the poorly explanatory narrative so easily: anyone who doesn't know Dillinger and his life well will have some difficulty following the film. This may help to understand why this film was a failure outside the US, where John Dillinger is little known.

Michael Mann is a very competent director, thorough and respectful of the past. We saw these characteristics in “Last of the Mohicans” and “Collateral”, among other quality films. The director does a very good job in this film, which follows well the adventures of the criminal's life and his tricks to elude the police. The cinematography is magnificent and makes wonderful use of light and color, especially in scenes filmed at night, and the filming locations, props, vehicles, costumes and sets are convincing and quite realistic. The film's biggest flaw, for me, is the dispassionate way it approaches everything. Considering that the protagonist is an outlaw and that nothing he did was acceptable, having managed to like him would have been a bonus. In fact, what stood out to me the most was the extremely thin line that separated the agents of the law and the criminals they pursued: think about it, Dillinger was not detained to be present at a trial, he was executed in a public square and surrounded by hundreds of people who could have been injured if things had gone out of control. Who is hero or villain? The waters are murky, in the film as in life itself.

All I can do is talk about the cast, which is confidently led by Johnny Depp, an actor who has a special talent for complicated and unusual characters, and who gives us a very competent interpretation. Christian Bale, another talented actor for impactful characters, played the federal agent in charge of arresting Dillinger, and he is extraordinary in his effort. Marion Cotillard does what she can in the role of Dillinger's girlfriend, but the truth is that the film did not need any attempt at romance, even though the character was necessary to understand the life of the heartthrob criminal, and that's why she doesn't add much to the product. Final. There are also notable additions to the cast, including Stephen Graham, David Wenham and James Russo.",9.0

US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become.

Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone""). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane's novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there's no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be. 

From the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don't exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn't enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty's want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he's trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times...

Yet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there's still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker's cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play. 

Then there's the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but ""Zodiac"" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson's photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is up to the usual tight standard.

It's always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There's also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that's me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10",7.0

11324,"**_Leonardo DiCaprio’s trip to Fantasy Island_**

In 1954, two US Marshals (DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) are sent to an island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the disappearance of a patient from the asylum for the criminally insane located there. The lead detective suspects something really fishy going on.

""Shutter Island"" (2010) is like a combination of “The Shawshank Redemption” and “A Beautiful Mind” with a little “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” Being helmed by Scorsese, it’s a top-notch production with a stellar cast, including the likes of Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley.

The first three quarters are quite good as a slow-burn eerie investigation with the milieu of post-WW2 America and interesting flashbacks to Dachau Concentration Camp. Unfortunately, the last quarter ruins the movie for me. Don’t get me wrong, the ‘twist’ could’ve been done in a compelling, streamlined way, such as in “The Sixth Sense,” but instead everything’s unnecessarily drawn out. For instance, the final sequence between DiCaprio and Michelle Williams is dreadfully dull.

Still, it’s a matter of taste. So, if what I described above intrigues you, give it a watch. Many cinephiles hail it.

Fittingly, the title, “Shutter Island,” is an anagram of ""truths and lies"" or ""truths/denials.”

The film runs 2 hour, 18 minutes, and was shot mostly in Massachusetts, but some stuff in Los Angeles and northeast of there at Hearst Ranch, San Simeon.

GRADE: B-",6.0
11324,"Shutter Island deserves all the praise for being one of those films that stays with you long after the credits roll. Martin Scorsese dives into the psychological thriller genre with precision, creating an atmosphere that’s equal parts eerie and thought-provoking.

Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely nails it as Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal investigating the disappearance of a patient from Ashecliffe Hospital. His performance is raw, vulnerable, and perfectly captures the gradual unraveling of Teddy’s psyche. Mark Ruffalo as his partner Chuck adds a subtle balance to the chaos, making their partnership intriguing to watch. And let’s not forget Ben Kingsley, his calm, enigmatic portrayal of Dr. Cawley gives the film its chilling edge.

Visually, the movie is a masterpiece. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is hauntingly beautiful, capturing the oppressive isolation of the island and the labyrinthine corridors of the asylum. The storm scenes are particularly memorable, heightening the tension and pulling you deeper into the mystery. And that score, Scorsese’s choice of music hits all the right notes to amplify the unease and suspense.

What sets Shutter Island apart, though, is the narrative. It’s a layered puzzle that keeps you second-guessing everything you see. The twists and revelations are not just there for shock value; they’re carefully woven into the story, making the rewatch value sky-high. That final line, “Which would be worse: to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?”, absolutely gut-wrenching.

Thematically, the film explores trauma, guilt, and the fragile nature of reality. It’s a deep dive into the human mind and the lengths we go to protect ourselves from the truth. Whether you see the ending as a tragedy or a twisted form of redemption, Shutter Island challenges you to confront the darker corners of your own understanding.

11326,"""Tommy"" (Barry Winch) is a young lad who lives an almost zombified existence with his mother ""Nora"" (Ann-Margret) and her second husband ""Frank"" (Oliver Reed). Flashback tells us that her first husband (Robert Powell) was a gallant flier during the second world war who didn't make it through, and so born on VE Day, the young baby might have been forgiven for thinking that all the flags and fanfare was for him! The kid wasn't born like this, but a trauma somewhere along the line appears to have short-circuited his brain, and so now he doesn't see, speak or hear. Despite their best efforts - and those of a few rather curious family ""friends"" he remains steadfastly in his own world until a pinball game. He's an ace at the thing and soon the fortunes of his family see his mother rolling around in diamonds on a white carpet or attending gala night at the opera. ""Nora"" gets a bit frustrated one evening with her now grown up son (Roger Daltrey) and an altercation ensues that brings him, once more, to life - and a life in which he recalls the drama that sent him silent in the first place. Mirrors are quite central to the plot here, and it's one of them that convinces ""Tommy"" he has an almost Messianic role in life - and so the family start to enjoy an evangelical life that would put ""Elmer Gantry"" to shame. Wealth, fame, acclaim - but ""Tommy"" still needs one more thing - fulfilment! Fat chance, here, but what Ken Russell does do is offer us a roller-coaster of a ride as the characters that touch his life range from benign to perverse. Tina Turner is great as the slightly deranged ""Acid Queen"" and Elton John's ""Pinball Wizard"" is probably the highlight of this whole rock opera that leaves no aspects of this man's life untouched. Along the way, we also takes great swipes at the sentimentality and venality of life - and Reed takes up that cudgel with a natural aplomb. The star? Well that's got to be Ann-Margret who quite literally throws herself in to part, holding a note and a dance with the best of them. I didn't love the last twenty minutes, but I suppose however this ended was never going to be entirely satisfactory and I never really appreciated Daltrey as a sex-symbol before, but as this gathers pace and he loses his shirt, it's not hard to see why he shone here - physically and metaphorically.

11328,"<em>'Pusher II'</em> improves upon its predecessor, if only by a little.

I found this 2004 flick to be comparatively more pleasant to watch, not in terms of a lack of violence or anything (there's plenty!) but more so just as a film in general - it feels more well made and a bit more progressive story-wise. It's still nothing perfect or anything that enthralled me at all, but I definitely class it highly (albeit minorly) than <em>'Pusher'</em>.

I would've preferred a sequel that followed up with Kim Bodnia's Frank, at least character-wise anyway as actor-wise Mads Mikkelsen is the one I'd prefer to watch instead. Mikkelsen puts in a good performance, 8 years on from his acting debut in the original. Away from Mads, Leif Sylvester Petersen is probably the standout - though all the support cast are pretty much level with each other to be honest.

I'm interested to see where the third and final flick from this series goes, given Mads Mikkelsen's absence and, from what I gather from the tiniest of look-ups out of pure nosiness, Kim Bodnia's continued disappearance. Viaplay recommended <em>'Pusher 3'</em> at the end of this film and their promo image features Zlatko Burić, so I know he makes it a hat-trick of appearances at least.",7.0
11329,"This offers quite an interesting look at just how seriously big business takes the selection of a jury, when large amounts of money are at stake. Gene Hackman is ""Fitch"", a man who makes a very good living acting on behalf of these organisations. His job is to probe into the private lives of prospective jurors, of their loves, peccadillos, politics - looking for weaknesses or reasons not to select them. This case involves one of the most contentious in the US pantheon of criminal law - the right to bear arms, and it falls to ""Rohr"" (Dustin Hoffman) to bring an action against a weapons manufacturer that is going to be tough. As the case proceeds, we are introduced to the less honourable nature of one of the jurors, and his girlfriend who have a plan of their own - and, as you'd expect, there is money and pressure being applied to ensure that the jury reach the ""correct"" verdict. Intriguing as the plot is, though, the film itself stutters along without much innovation. The courtroom scenes are a bit dreary and once we have established the premiss, Hackman's efforts are all rather repetitive and become less and less menacing and sophisticated as the story slips into a rather mediocre melodrama of private life shenanigans. Hoffman is adequate, no more, as are Rachel Weisz and John Cusack as the eagerly duplicitous but not awfully bright ""Easter"". Based on one of John Grisham's more inventive stories - nobody ever actually wants to be on a jury - this loses much in it's translation to film and by the mid-point I was really pretty turned off by the whole thing. It's watchable, but becomes more preposterous as it proceeds to a conclusion that, though not quite what you might expect, is still a bit flat.",6.0
11330,"Weakest of the three, for me.

For large portions of <em>'Pusher 3'</em> I was not truly feeling it as it was giving major 6/10 vibes, yet by the time it's gut-wrenching (pardon the pun?) final few scenes had concluded I actually wasn't unhappy with what I had just sat through. As noted, I do believe it's below the original two flicks but it kinda works still.

The major reason for that is Zlatko Burić. I'm not sure what it is about his (relatively low-key) acting but I just really enjoy watching him perform. He's solid enough in the 1996 and 2004 flicks and I like him in <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">2012</a>, so finally getting to see him in a lead role I was actually unsure if he was lead worthy - but he is, just about.

I see - and appreciate - what they were going for, it just doesn't come off in my opinion. It's all very pedestrian.

The characters around Popeye are annoying, as are the very forgettable musical numbers which don't fit in. I had high hopes for this, given I had heard good things of the titular character (not necessarily from this, just overall) as well as the fact of Mr. Williams appears. For me, in terms of his films that I've currently seen, this is closer to <em>'Hook'</em> than (the awesome) <em>'Bicentennial Man'</em>.

Robert Altman's Popeye isn't going to change anyone's weltanschauung. But good grief, is it delightful. A loving, slightly mad translation of the comic strip to screen, the film is a triumph of pure, unapologetic whimsy.

Harry Nilsson's musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre - strange, singable tunes that capture the film's cartoonish spirit. Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall don't just play Popeye and Olive Oyl; they become living, breathing cartoon characters. Their physical comedy is so precise, so exaggerated, that each movement feels like a panel from E.C. Segar's original comic strip.

The visual style is extraordinary. Sweethaven, built entirely on location in Malta, looks like a three-dimensional cartoon - all tilted angles, saturated colors, and impossible architectural perspectives. It's a world that exists somewhere between reality and illustration.

11345,"The most infamous serial killer of our time... is still out there.

The Zodiac is directed by Alexander Bulkley who also co-writes the screenplay with his brother Kelley Bulkley. It stars Justin Chambers, Robin Tunney, Rory Culkin, Philip Baker Hall, Brad Henke, Marty Lindsey, Rex Linn and William Mapother. Music is by Michael Suby and cinematography by Denis Maloney. Story is based on the true events involving a serial killer known as The Zodiac who terrorised the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1960s. He was never captured.

There's a lot of scorn poured on Bulkley's movie, which on the surface is understandable given that it's neither an in-depth examination of the actual case or a terrifying serial killer thriller. It's cause isn't helped, either, by David Fincher's meticulous version that followed in 2007. Yet there's value in The Zodiac, even if it's difficult to recommend with confidence.

The Bulkley's choose to focus primarily on one policeman and his family and how they are deeply affected by The Zodiac case. This involves Detective Matt Parish (Chambers) coming under increasing pressure at work, where his superiors are demanding a result, and at home, where his wife Laura (Tunney) grows frantic/frustrated by the day and his young son Johnny (Culkin) becomes unhealthily fascinated by the case.

The director paints a very good period backdrop whilst deftly filling the narrative with a sense of paranoia that surely enveloped the Bay Area as The Zodiac enacted his crimes. The killer's face is rightly never seen, though we get POV shots from the killer and glimpses from afar or from behind him. While interestingly there's a link between The Zodiac and young Johnny as each go about their respective ways.

The colour schemes used at various points of the story are well thought out, providing the film with a documentary feel for the exteriors and a saturated neo-noir universe for interiors. There's a spareness to the production that really aids the subject matter. Cast performances are fine, with Tunney really getting to grips with her character, and Suby's score rumbles along ominously.

Not to be sought out by blood hounds or Zodiac historians, this is still a better than average picture that holds some interest as it rises above its modest budget limitations. 6/10",6.0
11347,"***Quirky, amusing, sometimes surreal horror about a snake cult in England***

Directed & written by Ken Russell and loosely based on Bram Stoker’s novel, “The Lair of the White Worm” (1988) chronicles events in England when a young archeologist (Peter Capaldi) uncovers a skull of some unknown beast near a bed & breakfast run by two sisters (Sammi Davis & Catherine Oxenberg). These three and Eve’s beau (Hugh Grant) soon stumble upon an ancient snake cult led by the eccentric Lady Sylvia Marsh (Amanda Donohoe), who dwells at a lavish estate nearby.

The movie is a creative and entertaining creature feature reminiscent in tone & theme of “Squirm” (1976), but with Russell’s well-known offbeat excesses. The “creatures” are vampire-like snake people plus a gigantic serpent at the close, both of which recall the snake worshipers & giant serpents from “Conan the Barbarian” (1982).

There are some iconic cinematic images, like Donohoe as the vampiric snake lady, not to mention a few well done horror scenes, like a snake woman who’s cut in half, but still wiggles with furious intent. 

The snake cult is diabolical in an anti-Christ way and I can see why some viewers might find the movie shocking and offensive, like the weird nun-raping flashback. Yet everything's so exaggerated and sometimes cheesy with a bit o' humor thrown in that the film can't be taken very seriously, which negates it from being shocking or disturbing. Fun in a horrific way? Yes. Disturbing? No. Also, keep in mind that horror villains/monsters are SUPPOSED to drip with ee-vil and be shocking. The question is, do they win or do the noble protagonists win?

On the female front, the chief snake lady thinks she’s hotter than she really is as Donohoe amusingly hams it up. Meanwhile Catherine Oxenberg as Eve is a semi-highlight, particularly in the last act.

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot entirely in England (Hertfordshire; Manifold Valley, Staffordshire; Peak District National Park; and Derbyshire). Thor's Cave in Manifold Valley is magnificent.

Brilliant villainy, unnerving story and suspense pouring from every frame, Cape Fear is an abject lesson in how to produce a quality thriller that's borderline horror. Based on a novel called ""The Executioners"" written by John D. MacDonald, the piece is bolstered by some perfect casting decisions and by having a director able to pace with precision, thus it stands tall and proud as a highlight in a tough old genre. Robert Mitchum is Cady, a big hulking man with an immoral face, he terrifies purely by his undaunted objectives, with Mitchum clearly revelling in such a role. As Bowden we have Gregory Peck, playing it right as the uptight and stiff lawyer forced to find toughness from within.

What lifts this above many of its thriller peers is that the dialogue is firmly accentuated by the character portrayals, watch as Cady calmly digresses about how he learnt the law in prison, or how he seeps with deviant sexual aggression when confronting the Bowden women, it's badness personified and literally a force of evil, so much so that the breaking of an egg is metaphorically a portent of pain unbound. Director J. Lee Thompson's career shows him to have been a steady if unspectacular director at times, but he directs this with no amount of zip and he deftly reins it in for a stifling last quarter at the Cape Fear bayou (his interview on the disc releases is full of love and insights). Along with his cinematographer, Sam Leavitt, Thompson expertly uses shadow and light to consistently keep the feeling of dread looming as much of a hostile presence as Bobby Mitchum is throughout the play. 

By the time the finale reveals the denouement, it's hoped that you are as living on your nerves as this particular viewer always is when viewing this clinically sharp piece of thriller cinema. 9/10",9.0

There are films that are unfairly forgotten after the release of their respective contemporary remakes, and I have no doubt that this one can be included in that list. It was a film produced and starred by Gregory Peck, one of the movie stars of the 60s, and it has a great cast and a good script, with elements that remind us a little of the aesthetics of “noir” or some Hitchcock films. Unfortunately, most people have only seen the 1991 remake, which we'll talk about in due course. Perhaps this is, partly, due to the film's huge financial failure, which would dictate the end of Peck's production company.

The script is very good and is based on a novel called “The Executioners”. It tells the story of a lawyer, Sam Bowden, who lives in a coastal region of Georgia or North Florida, who begins to be harassed and pursued, in a discreet but threatening way, by Max Cady, an ex-convict who, eight years earlier, was convicted thanks to Bowden's testimony, earning him a visceral hatred that he now intends to satisfy with revenge. At Cady's insistence, who does nothing more than show up wherever Bowden and his family choose to roam, the Police cannot act beyond close surveillance. However, he knows that it is only a matter of time before something really happens.

The script is very good, but I confess that I found some flaws. I don't know the laws of the USA, but in my country, it is possible for the laws to force two people away if one of them feels consistently intimidated or threatened by the mere presence or proximity of the other. Of course, the premise that this is not possible under American law ends up allowing the film to reach the conclusion it has, with the final confrontation of the two men. In any case, the film works and is effective in creating suspense and giving us a real sense of tension and threat.

Skillfully directed by J. Lee Thompson, the film stars Gregory Peck, who does a very good job, albeit not particularly remarkable, and is well assisted by Polly Bergen and Lori Martin. In fact, it's the great performance of Robert Mitchum, who brought us the villain, that enchants us and steals our attention. He is naturally menacing, with his seemingly peaceful presence always sounding tense and deceptive. The film has some good supporting actors, such as Telly Savalas and Martin Balsam.

Technically, it's not a pretentious or overpriced film. The cinematography is not particularly remarkable, but it makes the most of what it has and gives us some very well-executed close-ups, as well as some scenes with lighting and style that show the influence of ""noir"" and Alfred Hitchcock. The highlight is undoubtedly the visual and sound effects and the excellent and iconic soundtrack, composed by Bernard Herrmann, and later reused for the remake film.",7.0
11351,"We are trapped in a broken down school bus out on East 9. And something is going to kill us if we don't get help out here right away!

Plot finds the demon known as The Creeper (Jonathan Breck), still having a little time left for feeding and harvesting human parts before his 23 year hibernation. A buffet bar of high school kids on a bus returning from a basketball match are now in his sights. But an avenging father played by Ray Wise is willing to take the fight to the monster. 

It's a simple as it sounds, really. Creeper picks off various members of the bus, which is the usual array of annoyingly obnoxious teenagers. The tension comes from wondering who is next in line, all while the fractured group (racial/sexuality tensions) try to come up with some sort of plan to survive until help arrives. Logically it's a laughable nightmare and goofs aplenty are within, but there's a neat gory ""B"" movie vibe about it driving it forward. Plus there's more of Creeper in flying mode and a bad ass Ray Wise to root for.

After the success of the first Jeepers Creepers film it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. With a little sadness we find that this sequel fails to capture the strengths that made the first film a refreshing horror joltathon. But regardless it still has some merits for a fun horror time waster. 6/10",6.0

""Jeepers Creepers 2"" (2003) is the best of the trilogy with the highlight being the creative and creepy monster, called the Creeper, which is reminiscent of the chief gargoyle in “Gargoyles” (1972), but more demonic and wholly evil. This is basically a confined location horror flick with the setting being the remote golden fields of Southern Cal (and the school bus).

The first film (2001) was hindered by its limited cast while this one tries to make up for it with a whole busload of kids and three school employees (two coaches and a bus driver). But the film generally drops the ball in the female department and, worse, focuses a little too much on shirtless jocks, which can be explained by the writer/director’s orientation (get real). There’s also zero depth; this is a movie about an evil winged creature that attacks a busload of youths and little else. But it’s very well done for what it is.

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Tejon Ranch and Long Beach).

Never Been Kissed sees Drew Barrymore's copy editor, Josie Geller, yearn to be a reporter. Something that comes her way when by way of a fluke, she's selected for an undercover mission at High School. Trouble is, is that she's got to be 17 again, and that's something that brings back all of those horrible moments from her high school days. The time of having no friends, the butt of the jokes and ignored by the boys (all told in cringe inducing flashbacks).

Cue much fun as the 25 year old Josie not only tries to bluff everyone that she's 17, but tries to fit in with the youth who have considerably changed from back in her days. Enter cool as ice brother Rob (David Arquette) who decides to lend a helping hand, with some funny and excellently scripted results. Not only this but we of course have the obligatory love interest, only this is a kicker as it concerns Josie's teacher Sam (a sickeningly handsome Michael Vartan). Cue Sam on mind overload as his feelings lead him onto what he thinks is morally dubious ground...

It's as frothy as can be is this one, perhaps in the running for the 90s most chickiest ckick flick? But, and I say this as a middle aged guy, the jokes are spot on, it's endearing as heck and it boasts a quite marvellous turn from Barrymore. It's the sort of performance that could light up the most turgid of comedy movies. It's a threefold character portrayal of some depth and no little charm. She's well supported by the always likable Arquette, while notable turns also come from John C Reilly, the ever reliable Molly Shannon and Leelee Sobieski. While the sharp eyed will spot future Green Goblin James Franco and Susan Storm herself, Jessica Alba, nestling in amongst the teen performers.

Look, I have some fairly negative memories of this movie over the years, and I'm not saying it is the best, but for all its flaws, it holds up surprisingly well.

The idea of Drew Barrymore (even in 1999) being able to pass for a high school student is nonsense.  I'm not that big a fan of hers, but she nails this role even if she's clearly an adult at high school, but what the movie is about, and what she expresses wonderfully is the emotion of being in the traumatic experience of high school when you're not part of the ruling class.

I feel like they casted well enough: David Arquette, Molly Shannon, J.C. Reilly, Leelee Sobieski, and Cress Williams (Black Lightning) all do great support roles, and Jessica Alba, Mary Shelton, Jordan Ladd, and  all do great antagonist roles.

The writing of writing about a story, in a story of one character hiding herself in another story is oddly meta on a few levels, but it remains complex without being overly complicated, is still funny, and has plenty of substance.

Their friendship is about to be severely tested, though, when the former man announced that he has split up with his wife. ""Oscar"" rides to the rescue with an offer for him to move in with him, and what now ensues are a cleverly written, and generally entertaining, series of domestic scenarios in which these two men must learn to cohabit. It's pretty clear from the outset that ""Oscar"" is not exactly house-proud and as the story develops their relationship starts to creak. Neil Simon has created a wonderfully witty, pithy and humorous dialogue which both men deliver with a great deal of natural timing; they immerse themselves in the roles - an unusual narrative for two men - and deliver quite an engaging observation on how these two friends simply cannot cope with each other full time. Aside from a few scenes from their card-playing buddies and a rather difficult double date with posh Brits ""Gwendolyn"" (Carole Shelley) and ""Cecily"" (Monica Evans) - which follows a scene of domestic petulance over some tardiness and meatloaf that is instantly recognisable to most of us, this is a fine example of two actors who gel really well on screen.

11357,"Apocalypse, End of the World, Armageddon. It's always got a face and a name.

After Halloween III veered in a new direction without Michael Myers, the indestructible killing machine of the franchise, the rights to the series changed hands and so it came to pass that part 4 (though part 3 in essence) brought Myers back. After being in a coma for ten years Myers is up for a transfer to a sanitarium, but wouldn't you know it, he wakes up and upon hearing he has a niece back in Haddonfield, he sets off on a murderous rampage back to where it all began.

It's one of the Halloween sequels that causes much debate among the series' fans, there are those who decry its lack of blood and its ordinary screenplay (both viable complaints), and those such as myself who like that it reverts back to what made the series start so brilliantly. Including a superbly devilish nod to the start of the 78 film.

Haddonfield becomes a town under siege, this the work of one monster, or as Donald Pleasence's scar faced doctor says - ""evil on two legs"". Myers once again is just glimpsed here and there, adding that unearthly suspense factor, until he hones in on his niece and her foster sister and the pursuit begins. Some of the interim characterisations are padding out the run time, the usual teen angst romantic flannel, but Pleasence's determined Dr. Loomis is never far away to remind us that everyone is doomed! Then of course there's the ending, which is an absolute beaut.

There's no brains on offer here, but it's a worthy sequel and a good tracer line for its iconic bogeyman. The story has moved on to another level and leaves the fans hankering for more. 7/10",7.0

11357,"Better than the original; and one of the best 80’s slashers

Ten years after the events of “Halloween” and “Halloween II” (which both took place on Halloween night, 1978), Michael Myers escapes captivity a second time and again returns to his hometown in Illinois with a direly concerned Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) hot on his trail. Myers goes after his sister’s daughter, Jamie, and is willing to take down the whole town of Haddonfield if necessary.

“Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers” (1988) ranks with the best 80’s slasher flicks and is actually superior to the somewhat overrated progenitor of the genre, “Halloween” (1978). Whereas the original “Halloween” was an effective low-key but classy slasher and deserves credit for starting the craze, it wasn’t without flaws and “Halloween 4” (1.) fixes those issues and (2.) improves upon its strengths.

For instance, while the original movie takes place during Halloween in Illinois, you certainly wouldn’t know this by the footage since it clearly looks like summer. This movie, by contrast, definitely looks like it takes place during the fall and has an all-around superior Halloween ambiance with trick-or-treaters and so forth. Another example is the original’s lack of drive and the fact that Michael only kills a few teenagers and doesn’t seem all that formidable whilst this film features a mounting build-up of suspense and potently conveys Michael’s deadly formidableness while upping the ante in the body count.

Other advances includes the lack of lame dialogue (like in the original when the girls were walking home) and Dr. Loomis has much more interesting things to do than lurk in the bushes by the Myer’s dilapidated abode speaking ridiculously ominous words. When Loomis speaks portentously in this entry there’s great reason to believe him (take, for instance, what happens to the Police Station).

Yet another (arguable) improvement is the women: Although Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Kyes (Loomis) and PJ Soles were fine in the original, “Halloween 4” has winsome Ellie Cornell as Rachel and hottie Kathleen Kinmont as Kelly and the movie wisely takes advantage of their presence in a classy way. Rachel may not strike you as anything special at first, but as the story progresses she emerges as an attractive and noble final girl.

The “Friday the 13th” franchise debuted two years after “Halloween” in 1980; and by October, 1988, when this film was released, the “Friday” franchise had no less than seven films under its belt. Meanwhile, “Halloween 4” was only the third Michael Myers movie (keeping in mind that “Halloween 3” was curiously disconnected from the Michael Myers mythos).

“Friday the 13th” of course ripped-off “Halloween,” but simultaneously added original components to the genre (e.g. summer camp and everything revolving around it, easily the best females in the slasher genre, as well as an increasingly devolving supernatural killing machine). “Halloween 4” sort of gets its revenge by borrowing from the “Friday” films; for instance, the character of Jamie Lloyd and what happens to her mirrors Tommy Jarvis’ story arc from 3-4 years earlier. Perhaps the greatest revenge is that “Halloween 4” is better than any of the “Friday” sequels after “Part 2” and is at least as effective as “Part 2.”

The original “Halloween” was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena & Hollywood) while this one was filmed in the Salt Lake City, Utah, region. Like the first film, it’s streamlined and doesn’t overstay its welcome.

Our hero, Dwayne Johnson, is doing a decent job of being a hero. The actions scenes, which is really why you are watching this movie after all, are reasonably well done. Of course they are more of TV-movie quality than anything else but good enough in the context of this movie.

Michael Myers survives his descent into a mind shaft from the previous movie and holds up with a hermit for a year before returning to his hometown in Illinois to attack his niece during Halloween and any trick-or-treaters who get in the way. As usual, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is on his trail.

“Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers” (1989) has the best sense of Halloween up to this point in the Michael Myers story arc with a considerable amount of the runtime involving the entertaining shenanigans of trick-or-treaters. While it’s not great like the previous entry it’s pretty much on par with the original 1978 movie and I actually prefer it even though it’s less classy/arty and more blunt.

This is the first movie in the series to throw in a little camp and comic booky-ness like the “Friday the 13th” franchise did with “Part III” (1982) and subsequent installments. The campiness has to do with the two goofy deputies and the comic booky-ness relates to the mysterious man-in-black and the corresponding twist at the end, which is supposed to segue into “Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995). Like “Friday the 13th Part III,” there’s a long sequence involving a similar-looking barn.

Every once in a while, when Hollywood is stuck for new swashbuckling ideas, they turn to the writer of ""The Three Musketeers"", ""The Man In The Iron Mask"" and ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"", one Alexandre Dumas père. Which of course is no bad thing as long as the adaptation is given care and consideration - which hasn't always been the case. So when it was announced that the director of Waterworld, Kevin Reynolds, was to direct the latest version of ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"", many feared the worst. Made for around $35 million, Reynolds' film fared OK at the Worldwide box office, taking in around $76 million. Yet although far from being a flop, it upped and vanished rather quickly and was barely given a mention come the arrival of 2003. Thankfully the film gathered momentum with the rental releases and is now firmly established as a much loved genre piece.

On the two big hitting movie internet sites, Rotten Tomatoes & IMDb, the film scores 75% and 7.5 respectively, that's about right I would say. Reynolds' film doesn't bring anything new to the table as regards the story, but if it isn't broke then why fix it? Staying safe and true to the spirit of the source, Reynolds has simply crafted a rip roaring movie about betrayal, torture, faith, revenge and love. The makers have costumed it up and added the necessary sword play ingredient. All that was needed was for his cast to deliver performances worthy of such period shenanigans. And he got them.

James Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes. Two years away from playing Jesus Christ, the role that would make his name known, Caviezel had prior to Cristo looked anything but a leading man. But here he finds a role to get his teeth into and it's a comfortable fit, and crucially he seems to be having a good time with it. No such point to prove for Guy Pearce (Fernand Mondego) though, for he already had ""L.A. Confidential"" & ""Memento"" under his belt. Here he gives it the full pompous villain act and struts around like some dandy spoiled brat. It's a film stealing performance that shows that the guy who played Mike Young in Aussie soaper Neighbours, has indeed come a long way. Richard Harris adds a touch of class as Abbé Faria, gravel voiced Michael Wincott does a nice line in sadistic bastard as the Château D'If governor, Armand Dorleac. While Luis Guzmán as Jacopo is fun comic relief and Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedès Iguanada is both sensual and heartfelt.

Never over camping the movie, Reynolds keeps it pacey and dots it with smart set pieces and memorable scenes. Backed up by an on form cast and a sure fire source story to work from, ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" turns out to be period winner. So see it if you haven't done so already. 8/10",8.0

His vengeance is cleverly structured, he determines to allow each of these people to turn on each other - using their own greed and mistrust to destroy the other. Alexandre Dumas wrote a great story, with loads of intrigue - yet somehow this iteration doesn't really get going. Too much of the build up is abridged (or just not there at all) and that makes the rest of the story weaker and less engaging. The production is adequate, the costumes and look of the film are good, but the pace and performances are both about box office than about characterisations. I felt indifferent about all of them - even the naive young ""Albert"" (Henry Cavill) whose character is actually quite pivotal in the book, helping remind ""Edmond"" of the humanity he once had before incarceration.

This is also kind of why I want to be able to review individual actors, just so I can write a memo to Guy Peirce and tell him that he needs to stop doing period literary pieces and go back to making films that don't require ascots and puffs.

And this brings me to the point in the review where I question why I know what the difference between an ascot and a puff are.

Anyway, self-reflection aside, the problem is that it doesn't know if it wants to be a thrilling adventure novel that is best epitomized by the writings of Dumas in all his pulp adventure glory... or if the story lasted in popularity for a century or so too long and now has to be regarded as a drama and treated with all the seriousness of a mature literary classic.

It teases with both and never settles on either. It kind of comes across that Wolpert, the writer, understood that Dumas was a pulp adventure writer but Reynolds, the director, thought Dumas was as serious as Dante.

It makes you feel like you are sitting in two different worlds. It kind of feels like you are watching a movie that wants to be a fun adventure yarn about revenge and prison breaks but every time that beast tries to escaped, it's forced back into it's cage by directorial gods of pretentious pompery.

11372,"_**Unconventional WW2 flick from 1977**_

Michael Caine is outstanding as Colonel Steiner, an untamed German paratroop commander, who's covert mission is to go to Britain and kidnap Winston Churchill whilst on a retreat. The Germans are helped by Irishman Liam Devlin, played by Donald Sutherland, who essentially paves the way for their operation at a coastal hamlet (shot in Cornwall and Berkshire, England). Jenny Agutter plays Devlin's near-jailbait romantic interest in the quaint village, while Larry Hagman and Treat Williams play American officers, the former foolishly gung-ho. Robert Duvall and Donald Pleasence are also on hand as Nazi officers.

As you can see from the plot, this is an unconventional WW2 picture. It doesn't feature the typical major battles or stereotypical characters and situations of most war flicks. Both Caine and Sutherland shine in their roles, especially Caine as the fearless Steiner. Memorable moments abound.

The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes, but feels shorter.

11372,"Following an animated staff meeting with Hitler, there's a suggestion put forward that the Nazis try to kidnap Winston Churchill. Spymaster Admiral Canaris (Anthony Quayle) thinks it's a dangerous idea, but Himmler (Donald Pleasence) wants it investigated. To that end, the admiral recruits ""Radl"" (Robert Duvall) to find a man who might be able to lead a team to get the job done. We've already met ""Col. Steiner"" (Michael Caine) and know he's a bit of a maverick, so ""Radl"" does a deal with him that will accomplish the task and save ""Steiner"" from a lively firing squad. It seems the Prime Minister is soon to visit a quiet country manor house near the Norfolk coast so this is their chance. The soldiers adopt the identity of British soldiers and work with the nearby villagers whilst laying the groundworks for their plot. A chance accident, though, reveals their identity to the villagers and things turn decidedly dangerous. Can the villagers find a way to warn the outside world? Caine does fine with this drama, and Donald Sutherland also delivers quite well as the IRA man who will do just about anything to see the British lose the war, but the rest of the cast rather underwhelm - especially the rather soporific ""Molly"" (Jenny Agutter) and curiously cast Jean Marsh. Quayle, Duvall and Pleasence barely feature at all and the denouement, though not quite what we were expecting, still can't quite enliven this rather over-scripted and far-fetched story. It's watchable enough, though, Caine sees to that - but just not quite the sum of it's parts.",6.0

Ultimately you have to think that those who have wanted to see Hollywood Homicide would have done so by now, certainly fans of the generational divided lead actors (Josh Hartnett and Harrison Ford) would have long since tuned in to see what it's like. It's fair to say that its reputation is most divisive, with some critics proving to be most ferocious in their summations. Personally I find it to be an enjoyable spin on the buddy buddy cop formula, where director Ron Shelton isn't afraid to put emphasis on characters instead of just filling out the pic with high octane bangs and crashes. The wry portrayal of the police system in a bustling Los Angeles is nicely etched into the froth, with the sidebar of coppers having two jobs being a deft poke in the ribs.

Good fun with well crafted action scenes, but the main strength is in the writing and to see once again that Ford has been very undervalued as a comedy actor of the years. 6.5/10",6.5

The best 'hip hop horror' out there, and yes there are actually quite a few. But I think that this one can be liked by fans that aren't big fans of hip hop either because it boasts of such great quality and director Ernest Dickerson definitly knows his horrors with plenty of homages to old Italian horror, as well as serving as sort of a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET in an urban setting.

Snoop Dogg plays the 'boogeyman' and he does so really well, it was written with Snoop Dogg in mind so it works really well.

Never aging Khalil Kain has one of the leads, he was also one of the leads in Dickerson's 1992 movie JUICE starring Kain, as well as Tupac Shakur and Omar Epps.

11382,"Despite his obvious enthusiasm, ""Shayne"" (John Cusack) can't convince producer (Jack Warden) to raise the cash to put on his latest play. There's just no demand for it, especially as his first two efforts didn't exactly set the heather on fire. Then an opportunity presents itself. It's one with compromise, though. He can have the thing fully funded if he agrees to cast ""Olive"" (Jennfer Tilly). Snag? Well she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag and has one of those squeaky voices that killed so many a silent-film star! Her boyfriend, ""Nick"" (Joe Viterelli) is the local kingpin so it's a straight choice - cast her or no cash. Much to the chagrin of the uber-theatrical ""Helen"" (Dianne Wiest) he decides to sacrifice his honour for his art, and what now ensues sees this mix of thespians, crooks, amateurs and temper-tantrums try to get the play on the stage. Just to make sure she's OK, her boyfriend has sent his enforcer ""Cheech"" (Chazz Palminteri) as a bit of security for ""Olive"" and his no-nonsense approach to the production histrionics of the whole thing initially brings him into conflict with the director, but gradually ""Shayne"" begins to realise that ""Cheech"" has a bit of an aptitude for writing, and so a collaboration of sorts emerges that against all the odds might just give this thing a fighting chance. Wiest is at her best here delivering a sort of ""Streisand"" meets ""Norma Desmond"" character that epitomises that generation of film star who really did believe their own publicity machine. Cusack also does well, as does Palminteri and there's an engagingly (and annoyingly) lively effort from Tilly who plays the rather witless moll to a T. It's funny at times, especially if you've ever worked in the theatre and packs quite a lot of entertainment, and swipes at that very industry, into a ninety minutes that hits the ground running and rarely stops for breath. One of Woody Allen's more original concepts that takes him away from his routine man-with-neuroses comfort, is stylishly put together, and is well worth a watch.",7.0

The Hard Way is directed by John Badham and collectively written by Lem Dobbs, Michael Kozoll and Daniel Pyne. It stars James Woods, Michael J. Fox, Stephen Lang, Annabella Sciorra, Luis Guzman, LL Cool J and Delroy Lindo. Music is by Arthur B. Rubinstein and cinematography is by Don McAlpine and Robert Primes.

An action movie star researching a role is allowed to tag along with a hardboiled New York City policeman, who is less than enamoured with his company as he looks to stop the serial killer known as ""The Party Crasher"".

Given John Badham's CV, The Hard Way looked to be right up his street, his career containing solid if unspectacular buddy buddy action comedy pictures. This is just above average thanks to the Woods and Fox pairing and some nifty dialogue one liners. The concept of a Hollywood star tagging along with a grizzled real copper is smart, but the pic ends up over stuffed, even if the action and comedy - courtesy of some high energy set-pieces - rewards enough to stop tedium setting in.

Lang's maniacal villain is over the top, though he seems to be enjoying himself, while such is the brisk pace for the most part, when it sags into its quieter periods it strains the patience - the blend uneasy. Yet the finale rewards on basic action terms, with suspense intact, to ultimately give us a just above average pic of its type. 6/10",6.0
11387,"_**Lawrence of the Jungle**_

In the late 1800s, a gallant officer in the English merchant service (Peter O'Toole) falls prey to cowardice in a weak moment and is ousted to drift from job to job until he is inspired to help a Southeast Asian village purge a cruel general (Eli Wallach), hoping for redemption. The peripheral cast includes Paul Lukas, Jack Hawkins, Curd Jürgens, Daliah Lavi and James Mason.   

Richard Brooks’ “Lord Jim” (1965) is heavily boiled-down from the superfluous prose of Joseph Conrad's 1900 novel and comes across as overly sentimental and melodramatic. The fictitious village of Patusan is located in Malaysia in the book where the population is largely Muslim while in the movie, which was made in 1964 when the Vietnam situation was escalating, Patusan is deftly moved several hundred miles north to mainland Southeast Asia where the population is Buddhist.

At its heart, this is an exploration of the negative effects of fear and the thin line between cowardice and heroism, which is reminiscent of “They Came to Cordora” (1959), but with the setting and general tone of “The Ugly American” (1963), albeit 60+ years in the past. 

With O’Toole playing a character that helps a ragtag group of idealist indigenous people you can’t help but think of “Lawrence of Arabia” (1962) transferred to the jungle. But “Lord Jim” comes across awkward and boring by comparison, not to mention more old-fashioned even though it’s newer by a few years. The ending is questionably done and leaves a bad taste.

On the positive side, some elements are well done, even artistic, and clearly influenced Coppola’s outstanding “Apocalypse Now” (1979).  

The movie runs 2 hours, 34 minutes, and was shot in Lantau Island, Hong Kong; Angkor Wat, Cambodia; and Malacca, Malaysia. Studio work was done at Shepperton Studios, Surrey, England.

Richard Brooks keeps this film moving along quickly with plenty of attention to the gist (if not always the detail) of the book. The episodic nature of the narrative allows the other characters - including Jack Hawkins' ""Marlow"" - to play their parts for twenty or minutes or so before the plot moves on to pastures a bit new and so it is rarely dull.

The Natural is a wistful sports movie, one that asks every person who views it to buy into the whimsy and mythologising on show. If able to do that then it's a film of beguiling beauty, awash with strength of the human spirit and of luscious technical credits. The Arthurian core to Roy Hobbs' (Redford a superb presence yet calmness personified) second chance ensures we always know this is fanciful stuff, but that's just fine, we are in Field of Dreams territory here and fans of such fare are rewarded royally. Period art design, photography and musical score are grade ""A"", snuggling up nicely with a support cast to Redford that is of high end proportions.

But of course, this movie is based on a novel by Bernard Malamud, though there are hints of actual events here and there.

It is an entertaining movie, presenting baseball as America’s game and therefore, ultimately, above corruption. It has an old timey feel, perhaps even older than the 1939 setting that is presented.

11400,"**_Arty, draggy historical romance_**

I've seen four of Terrence Malick's movies -- ""The New World"" (2005) and his three previous efforts, ""Badlands"" (1973), ""Days of Heaven"" (1978) and ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998). He's an arty filmmaker who isn't interested in making conventional ""blockbusters."" His three earlier efforts are all well-done and in some ways great. For instance, his pictures are always beautiful and imaginative, but there's also an airy, leisurely quality that will turn off some viewers. My favorite, by far, is ""The Thin Red Line,"" a flawed masterpiece about the taking of a hill during the Guadalcanal Campaign in WWII. It successfully transcended it's storyline to seek answers to life's most profound questions. I guess Malick does this in all his films to some degree, but he was particularly effective with ""The Thin Red Line.""

I mention this to stress that I'm familiar with Malick's films and understand his approach. I was really looking forward to ""The New World,"" a historical drama detailing the establishment of the 1607 Jamestown, Virginia, colony with Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and others (Christopher Plummer, Wes Studi, etc.).

Shot near the actual locations on the Chickahominy River, Virginia, the film -- to be expected -- is beautiful to look at and the costumes, casting, etc. are all top-of-the-line. Unfortunately, for me, the pace is tedious and the themes aren't compelling enough to keep me spellbound. It's more than a tale of discovering a new world or new culture (for both sides); it's mostly a romance, which doesn't do much for me. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe because the pace was too draggy or possibly because I don't find Kilcher as Pocahontas all that captivating. Don't get me wrong, she's excellent in the role; I just don't find her anything to go ga-ga over, as Smith and Rolfe do in the story.

One problem I have with the movie is the ridiculous romanticizing of the Natives as super-virtuous. Exhibit A is when Smith reflects in a voice-over: ""They are gentle, loving, faithful, lacking in all guile and trickery. The words denoting lying, deceit, greed, envy, slander, and forgiveness have never been heard. They have no jealousy, no sense of possession.""

_Why sure!_

If the Indians had no sense of possession why did they attack the settlement when the Englanders failed to leave the next Spring? Why were tribes in regular warfare all over the Americas? Are we to believe not one of the Natives knew what a lie was? Or jealousy, envy, greed and slander? I get that the naturals weren't yet defiled by European-styled urbanization, but to suggest the above is pretty absurd. You can't tell me there wasn't a brave or two who had his eyes on young Pocahontas and felt a ""smidgen"" of jealousy when Smith stirred her romantic interests.

The only way I can get past such nonsense and enjoy the movie is the fact that the voice-over in question was SMITH's idealized, romanticized perspective of a people with which he was enamored. In other words, it wasn't reality; it was his temporarily clouded opinion.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The New World"" will be more appreciated by those who enjoy arty romantic films. For me, I'm in the middle: I see the good of the film -- even the greatness -- and value it, but I can't deny the film's shortcomings as far as a viewing experience goes. Regardless, it's great to be able to go back in time and visualize how it was when the Jamestown colony was established, highly romanticized as it is portrayed here.

The film runs 136 minutes (long enough) and the extended cut 172 minutes.

GRADE: C+",5.0
11400,"So, The New World… where do I start? It’s visually great. The way Malick captures the connection between the tribes, nature, and the land makes it easy to get lost in the world he’s building. But the story? Yeah, it could’ve used some serious work.

The first act kicks things off strong. You get this detailed look at the tribes and their initial encounters with the English colonists. There’s this whole adventurous vibe, like you’re about to watch an epic exploration story unfold. But then the movie pivots hard into the second act and starts focusing on Captain John Smith and Pocahontas. Okay, I get it, their relationship is important, but it feels like the broader story gets pushed to the side. And then halfway through that act, Captain Smith is out, and suddenly it’s all about Pocahontas and her new romance with John Rolfe. By the time we hit the final act, it’s entirely about Pocahontas, her life in England, and her trying to find her place in this new world. The whole movie feels like it keeps changing its mind about what it wants to be.

That’s where it lost me a bit. What started as this epic about cultures clashing and survival turns into a love story, and then into a drama about identity and loss. Don’t get me wrong, the individual pieces are interesting, but together? It’s messy. It feels like Malick didn’t know what direction to take the story, so he just went with all of them. The plot kind of fizzles out—like, what’s the point of it all? The English colonize the land, force the indigenous people to adapt, and then it ends with Pocahontas raising a kid with an Englishman in England.

Now, to be fair, the production is stunning. The costumes, the set design, the overall atmosphere... Even though I’m no expert on the tribes or their customs, the emotional connection is there. You can tell a lot of care went into making this world feel real. The cinematography is next-level. Malick knows how to make every shot look like a painting, and that’s something I appreciated even when the story wasn’t holding my attention.

But ultimately, while the movie’s storytelling style works, it’s dreamy and poetic, the overall plot just needed more focus. It starts as one thing, shifts to another, and ends as something else entirely. It’s like it can’t decide what it wants to say, and that’s frustrating because it had so much potential.",7.0

Inspired by the cartoon drawings of Ronald Searle, The Belles of St. Trinian’s is the first part of a franchise that still thrives even today. With 7 films currently under the Trinian’s banner, the roguish behaviour of the girls and their manner of dress sense passed into pop culture and is still going strong today. Either for sexual titillation (the St Trinian’s look has always been popular at fancy dress parties) or as a tag for unruly girls in British schools, it’s hard to believe that Searle envisaged the ever lasting appeal of his creations. Unfortunately the films are a mixed bunch, with a couple of them just plain bad. This however is not a problem with The Belles, the best of the bunch by some margin.

The Barchester Bedlam.

Pic is fronted by Sim in a dual role of brother and sister. The art of drag has been tarnished over the years by some of the more stuffy members of the human race, but in the right hands it often works so well, as evidence by the wonderful Sim here. The plot involves a gambling sting at the big horserace on the horizon, with Flash Harry (Cole) aided and abetted by the terrors of St. Trinian’s. It’s all very chaotic and horsey, both in the equine sense and in horseplay terms. Grenfell is the policewoman who goes under cover as a teacher in the school, where the staff roster is populated by British stars of the future like Beryl Reid, Joan Sims and Irene Handl.

The girls, of various stages of their schooling, smoke, toke, drink and take every opportunity to cause mischief. Their reputation precedes them, as the train that carries them inward bound for the new term approaches, the town citizens start to board the place up, even the chickens run off into hibernation! This is the on going joke that works right to the film’s conclusion, sadly it would run out of steam by the time The Great St Trinian’s Train Robbery pulled into the station in 1966. But Belles is great fun, very British of course and very clever. From Sim being dry as the Sahara and Grenfell’s Duracell Bunny performance, to those rascal girls, the school is open for frolics and energised bedlam. Enjoy. 8/10",8.0

The story is a little cringe-making at times, but the fact that all of the naughtiness comes from these devious and extremely innovative girls makes for a fun ninety minutes of escapades and japes. Plenty of flour fights and who's ever seen an instrument of torture adapted from a laundry wringer?

Meanwhile a tycoon & his daughter take over The Daily Planet (Sam Wanamaker & and Mariel Hemingway).

“Superman IV: The Quest for Peace” (1987) is the weakest of the quadrilogy because the Salkind family sold the franchise to a Grade B production company, Cannon, and so instead of the healthy $39 million budget of “Superman III” (1983) it was slashed to $17 million (although it was originally supposed to be $36 million), which is apparent in the low-rent opening credits and the non-special effects throughout.

Christopher Reeve stars as Superman for the final time, to as decent effect as you'd expect.

11412,"**A good action and suspense film, although with several flaws to point out.**

This is a pleasant thriller, which presents us with a story that does not seem original or unusual, but that works perfectly and pleasantly entertains the audience. It all starts when a young suburban teacher, married and mother of a girl, begins to have particularly violent flashes of memory. She has amnesia, she doesn't know who she is, and the increasingly palpable prospect of a dark past leads her to investigate things further, fearing the consequences that could come to her family. In order to carry out her inquiries, she hires a private detective, who appears to be just trying to charge her as much money as possible.

I prefer not to reveal much more about the script, in order not to spoil it, but the truth is that I felt, when I saw the film, that the ideas were not at all original and that I have seen some films that sound similar. Of course, considering the number of films made per year, it is a reasonably minor problem and the most important thing is whether things work as they should. In this case, the film is effective and offers the audience what it promises.

Director Renny Harlin is competent enough for the job at hand, and ensures capable direction, but not without flaws. For example, he was unable to realize that the plot sounded excessively far-fetched, after a certain point, and that the film was a little long for its genre, making it advisable to make some surgical cuts in the editing room to remove fifteen or twenty minutes without notable damage. Somewhat as a result, the film has an uneven pace and sometimes wastes too much time, immobilizing the action and damaging the build-up of suspense.

Considering that it is a film with a lot of action, I believe it is fair to give special praise to the work of the stunts and also the makeup, special and sound effects teams. They are the ones who help create the chases, the shootouts, the explosions and all the other incredible scenes that put the audience on the edge of their seats. Without originality, but with effectiveness and professionalism, these artists made a magnificent contribution to the film, and it must be said. Without much original material (just one or two melodies), the soundtrack includes a series of quality themes that include Muddy Waters, Patti & Labelle and other artists, as well as a beautiful song by Neneh Cherry as the final theme.

Geena Davis heads a cast full of good actors. She is a creditable protagonist and a good bet, giving us a consistent interpretation. However, she is much more insecure when the plot enters the romance. She is not a good romantic actress, and does not seem to have established a very good partnership with Samuel L. Jackson. This actor, who has no difficulty with action scenes, also seems like a fish out of water if things take a turn for romance. Luckily, the film doesn't require much of that, and the actor does an essentially positive job. Craig Bierko is a competent villain, and David Morse is a good addition, even if he has little time to do anything. Brian Cox didn't have time for anything, and I honestly think he was wasted.",6.0

Seeing a chance, and despite the fact that they pretty much loathe each other, they abscond and plan to jump a train to escape. As they flee, they gradually learn to respect - even like - each other before arriving at a smallholding where they befriend the woman (Cara Williams) who lives there with her young son ""Billy"" (Kevin Coughlin). After a few days, it becomes clear that she and ""Joker"" have taken a bit of a shine to each other, and so she concocts a plan to drive the now separated ""Joker"" and her son in one direction whilst ""Cullen"" heads off separately into the swamp and towards the railway. All sounds good, but when ""Joker"" discovers that the plan has some perilous flaws for his erstwhile buddy, he has choices to make - with ramifications for all concerned, especially as the well-meaning but dogged Sherriff ""Muller"" (Theodore Bikel) and the less scrupulous ""Capt. Gibbons"" (Charles McGraw) are also in hot pursuit. Essentially this is a two hander between two actors who work well together, who use a potent - and sometimes humorous - story and script to offer us an insight into an evolution of the need for the survival into one enhanced by an increasing mutual affection. They both have their flaws, their bigotries - but when it comes down to it, their adventures illustrate the very pointlessness of these traits and that message is clearly augmented by the attitude of the decent ""Muller"" and also by many others whom they encounter on their trek for freedom. The story addresses political and racist issues with a punch, we are never faced with pontification here, just with an opportunity to realise for ourselves how petty and stupid some of our irrational attitudes are.

When his aunt suddenly dies, a grieving horror writer and Vietnam vet (Katt) moves into her manor wherein he experience strange and frightening things. What’s going on? Wendt plays his neighbor, Kay Lenz his ex-wife and Richard Moll a soldier pal in Vietnam. 

""House"" (1985) takes the done-to-death haunted house genre and adds creativity and humor along with the expected frights. It’s an entertaining horror/comedy where everything ‘clicks,’ mixing elements of “Poltergeist” (1982), “Basket Case” (1982) and “Ghostbusters” (1984). The Vietnam sequences are odd for the genre, but the pieces of the puzzle fit by the last act. 

Mary Stavin (Tanya) stands out on the feminine front with a couple quality scenes.

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot in Monrovia, California (house exteriors), which is just northeast of Los Angeles, as well as Doheny Mansion at Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles (interiors).

Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo do return and are as they were before. The most interesting bits in regards to the cast, for me anyway, are the appearances of Robbie Coltrane and Eric Idle. The running gag with the latter actor is probably the best part of this movie, to be honest.

These (first two, at least) films are at least short at 90 minutes and it is cool see to see them travel and film on location throughout all the different places shown. As for the nitty-gritty, though, I can't say I'd recommend this one. It misses a fun ending, which the original had.",6.0

It does go through peaks and troughs, there are some uninteresting moments but by and large what I was viewing was passable entertainment. The Vegas setting and shenanigans keep it watchable, the dam scenes are good too.

Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are back yet again, as is Randy Quaid. I still don't really rate the latter's character all that much, pretty annoying in fact (and not in the intended sense); Chase's Clark is supposed to be <i>the</i> idiot here, so always feels odd to have an even bigger idiot.

The more sentimental conclusion doesn't totally land, at least in terms of how it's portrayed. It felt watching that it was attempting to be super sensitive about family and love for each other, but these aren't the sort of movies where that fits. The Griswolds are dysfunctional, not lovable or relatable.

Today there is a clear shift and we aren't seeing that much of it, Nike hasn't changed their practices of out-sourcing and sweatshops and are now an iconic brand on one side of the divide. Outsourcing is now supported by the left where ""the jobs aren't coming back, deal with it"" is a commonly heard phrase there. It wasn't back in 2003.

So, watching it in 2003 as opposed to 2018 it's interesting to see a lot of the same faces that once opposed it speaking on the news in favor of how the corporations work today.

If memory serves, Noam Chomsky is the only political voice that hasn't made an abrupt shift or dialed it back in the decade plus since it's release.

Despite the shift in some of the voices heard in the documentary, it does do an excellent job tracking the evolution of the corporation in the United States, how it started in our earliest days, straight through how it became an individual entity politically, and onto how that identity as a ""person"" effected our politics.

And, at times, it was moving, given that it did treat people who work for corporations very well, even interviewing them so that they can express that, yes, they too had the same concerns as the people protesting them, but were bound by the law to pursue policies that would generate the most profit for their shareholders, which illustrates an interesting problem that is often ignored with discussing the topic.

It remains educational today, even if there has been a distinct shift on how the topic and some of the corporations highlighted are handled by the people interviewed for the documentary.",10.0

A critical part of WWII gets the big epic cinematic treatment, with all star casting and lots of noise. Though purporting to be exactly how things were during this particular battle, a pinch of salt is also needed. Much of the film is taken up with laying foundations for the air-sea engagement of the title, political posturing and military machinations are joined by needless sub-plots. The dialogue is often cheese laden, some characterisations equally so, while the splicing of real life footage and other war movie moments start to detract.

Kang-ho Song, Sang-kyung Kim and Roe-ha Kim don't exactly see eye to eye as they set about their task, adopting some scientific and not-so scientific approaches to their detection. The stylish and witty writing allows the characters to develop at a slow, but steady and interesting pace - using humour, pathos and violence - and at times it is the methods and attitudes of the police that appear under more scrutiny than the perpetrator of the crimes! Sadly, though, it does sag towards the end. The sharp pace of the writing and the intensity of the performances having reached a pretty high plateau, comes off the boil a bit and I found the ending annoyingly self-defeating: the identity of the criminal being less important to me than the collapsing integrity of those charged with his discovery. We never quite get back to that high standard of storytelling achieved in the first 90 minutes and as the quirkiness of the plot becomes more subsumed into the increasing frustrations of the investigators, the film becomes more and more a generic crime thriller losing much of its uniqueness.

11431,"There are a lot of sub-genres in movies: spaghetti Westerns, Police Procedural Mysteries, and Epic Fantasy - like Lord of the Rings. You can usually find a lot of room within these sub-genres for imaginative examples. They can be wildly different. Romantic Comedies seem to have less leeway. You have a formula that is often used, with minor changes here and there. The characters usually seem to have little in common at first glance, one of the characters usually gets sidetracked by another love interest (in Fever Pitch the love interest is the Boston Red Sox), there is a breakup where one or both becomes miserable, and the one who is ""at fault"" usually has to make a grand gesture at the end to mend the split. And of course there are jokes and romance.

I think Fever Pitch is an excellent example of the genre. The two main characters are witty and charming and provide a lot of laughs. They are caring people and there is  great chemistry between them. You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy it (though perhaps Yankee fans should steer clear), but like with most romantic comedies, you might want to set your cynicism aside for the duration, especially if you are a guy watching it with your favorite lady. If she is okay with the sports theme, you can let the romantic moments wash over you.

Several college youths agree to be part of a reality TV show where they stay in the dilapidated Myers’ residence in Haddonfield, Illinois. Unbeknownst to them, Michael is still alive and has returned to his home town after stopping by the asylum to visit Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis). 

""Halloween Resurrection"" (2002) is the seventh installment of the Michael Myers saga (not counting the unrelated “Season of the Witch”) and is the final film in the series until the remakes. It gets a lot of hate because of what happens in the opening act and the inclusion of Busta Rhymes, but it’s serviceable and definitely superior to the lousy “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995). It’s just kinda unimaginative and cartoonish with several bits being hackneyed or predictable by this point.  

The feminine department includes Daisy McCrackin (Donna), Katee Sackhoff (Jen), Bianca Kajlich (Sara), and Tyra Banks (Nora). The beautiful women wandering around a rundown domicile and dying one-by-one is reminiscent of “Death Tunnel” (2005) but without the amazing cinematic artistry (even though it cost $11.5 million MORE), not to mention “Death Tunnel” has better women.

The pic very much harks back to the glory days of film noir in the 40s and 50s, where some talented film makers began to tell stories of returning war veterans finding what they left behind is now alien to them - with some characters, as is the case here - deeply scarred by their experiences. Add in some gangster elements and the coup de grâce that is the scintillating heist, and clearly the brothers have seen many an old classic film. That the narrative is tried and tested stops the piece hitting greater heights, this in spite of some super acting (especially Tate and the always value for money Keith David) and the hard hitting violence that pierces the senses.

She presents us with a vulnerable character whom you would expect to spend her entire life overlooked, living in the same town for a life unhappily married to a local plumber. Sexton is also quite engaging as the outwardly aggressive and brutish character whom, as we get to know him, is actually not in a wildly dissimilar boat to ""Dawn"".

“Mighty Aphrodite” (1995) is a quirky comedy set in Manhattan, which is unsurprising with Woody at the helm. The heart of the plot, described in my title blurb above, is reminiscent of “Hardcore” (1979) minus the gravity.

Allen always just seems the same to me, and here is no different, but Sorvino really does deliver the goods as the well-meaning woman who has an honesty streak a mile wide. Of course, there's the obligatory age gap between the two, and between him and his wife (she's thirty years his junior) which again serves to fuel the frustrations of a man who seems determined never to be satisfied - but hey, isn't that true of most Woody Allen films.

A newlywed couple moves into a shoreline house on Long Island with their three little kids. The house was the scene of a mass killing a year earlier but the parents (James Brolin & Margot Kidder) didn’t think it mattered and, besides, it enabled them to purchase the homestead at a much reduced price. Then strange things start happening.  

""The Amityville Horror"" (1979) was arguably the best haunted house movie up to that point in time and was hugely successful at the box office, inspiring a gazillion sequels, remakes and documentaries. There are similarities to ""The Shining"" (1980): Both movies were based on books published in 1977, but the film version of ""The Amityville Horror"" was released a year prior to “The Shining” and was based on the supposedly true story of what happened to the Lutz family whereas Stephen King’s novel was purely fictional.

The 2005 remake with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George deviates even further from the book and is a brisker, more modern version of the story. Yet this classic version still works as a moody and mysterious drama with horrific touches. Unlike the remake, the movie takes its time to establish and develop the characters and I appreciated this; for instance, Mr. Lutz's employee (Michael Sacks) and his spiritually curious girlfriend (Helen Shaver), as well as the two priests (Rod Steiger and Don Stroud).

Gene Siskel criticized it on the grounds that it wasn’t enjoyable. Seriously? Since when are horror flicks supposed to be enjoyable? This is a realistic drama with some creepy paranormal things thrown on top, based on an allegedly true account. I don’t think the filmmakers were shooting for “enjoyable.” That said, underneath the darkness the picture has a good, warm heart.

Was the actual Lutz’s account true or not? They seemed to have experienced some troubling things at the house during their month-long stay and passed a Polygraph by two top polygraph experts but, assuming their story wasn’t concocted for profit (which many believe was the case), the events were certainly amped-up for the book & movie for the purpose of an entertaining tale. By the way, the large Dutch Colonial house still stands in Amityville, albeit the exterior was remodeled and hence the two distinctive windows appear standard.

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes and was mostly shot in New Jersey as follows: Toms River (house), Point Pleasant (church), Georgian Court University in Lakewood (meeting with the hooded priest), Ocean County and Scotch Plains; as well as indoor scenes done at MGM Studios in Culver City, California; plus some shots done in Long Island, Connecticut and Glendale, California.

Visually, thematically and narratively it remains a clinical piece of cinema, a probing study of madness that dares to put a serial killer and the man hunting him in the same psychological body, asking us, as well as William Petersen's FBI agent Will Graham, to empathise with Tom Noonan's troubled Tooth Fairy killer. Here's a thing, too, Francis Dolarhyde (The Tooth Fairy) is a functioning member of society, he is quite frankly a man who could be working in a shop near you!

Mann and his team are not about over the top or camp performances, gore is kept to a premium, the real horror is shown in aftermath sequences, conversations and harmless photographs, but still it's a nightmarish world. Suspense is wrung out slowly by way of the characterisations. Will has to become the killer, and it's dangerous, he knows so because he has done it before, when capturing Dr. Hannibal Lecktor. Needing to pick up the scent again, to recover the mindset, Will has to go see the good doctor who has a penchant for fine wines and human offal. These scenes showcase Mann at his deadliest, a bright white cell filmed off kilter, each frame switch showing either Lecktor or Graham behind bars, they are one. When Lecktor taunts Will about them being alike, Mann understands this and visually brings it out. Dolarhyde's living abode is murky in colour tones and furnished garishly, and with mirrors, paintings and a lunar landscape, yet when Dolarhyde is accompanied by Joan Allen's blind Reba, where he feels he is finally finding acceptance, this house is seen at ease because of the characterisations. Switch to the finale and it's a walled monstrosity matching that of a killer tipped back over the edge. Brilliant stuff.

If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.

Lecktor, soon to be back as the source material Lecter in the film versions that follow, is actually not in the film that much. Brian Cox (chilling, calculating, frightening and intelligent) as Lecktor gets under ten minutes of screen time, but that's enough, the character's presence is felt throughout the picture in a number of ways. The Lecktor angle is very relative to film's success, but very much it's one strand of a compelling whole, I realise now that Mann has deliberately kept us wanting more of him visually. Noonan is truly scary, he lived away from the rest of the cast during filming, with Mann's joyous encouragement, the end result is one of the best and most complex serial killer characterisations ever. Lang scores high as weasel paparazzi, Allen is heart achingly effective without patronising blind people and Farina is a huge presence as Jack Crawford, Will's friend and boss who coaxes Will back into the fray knowing full well that Will's mind might not make it back with him. But it's Petersen's movie all the way. His subsequent non film career has given ammunition to his knockers that he is no great actor. Rubbish, with this and To Live and Die in L.A. he gave two of the best crime film portrayals of the 80s. He immerses himself in Will Graham, so much so he wasn't able to shake the character off long after filming had wrapped. There's a scene in a supermarket where Will is explaining to his son about his dark place, where ""the ugliest thoughts in the world"" live, a stunning sequence of acting and a showcase for Petersen's undoubted talents.

Newcomers to the film and Mann's work in general, could do no worse than spend the ten minutes it takes to watch the Dante Spinotti feature on the disc. Apart from saving me the time to write about Mann's visual flourishes, it gives one an idea of just how key a director and cinematographer partnership is in a film such as this. The audio is crisp, which keeps alive the perfect in tone soundtrack and eerie scoring strains of Rubini and The Reds. Some say that the music of Manhunter is dated? I say that if it sits at one with the tonal shifts and thematics of a story then that surely can never be viewed as dated. And that's the case here in Manhunter. The director's cut is included as part of the package but the transfer is appalling, and for the sake of one cut scene that happens post the Dolarhyde/Graham face off, there's really not much to the DC version anyway. The theatrical cut is perfect, brilliantly realised on Blu-ray to birth a true visual neo-noir masterpiece. 10/10",10.0
11454,"With ""Hannibal Lecktor"" (Brian Cox) now safely behind bars, the traumatised profiler ""Graham"" (William Petersen) might be looking forward to a well earned-retirement. Thing is, the ""Tooth Fairy"" has other plans as he embarks on a killing spree that causes his erstwhile FBI boss ""Crawford"" (Dennis Farina) to seek his help. These murders are truly gruesome with entire families killed, inside their own homes, on nights with a full moon. With the next one of those due very soon, ""Graham"" has to enlist the help of his former tormentor - whose help is never as straightforward as he might like - to see if they can establish some patterns and preempt more slaughter. Meantime, we are introduced to ""Dollarhyde"" (Tom Noonan) who's about eight foot tall and maybe not the most stable of photographers we are ever going to meet. It's possible that he might succumb to the more calming influence of the lovingly blind ""Reba"" (Joan Allen) but with the pressures mounting you wouldn't want to bet on that. Is there a connection? As with Thomas Harris's ""Red Dragon"" book, the audience is aware of far more than the pursuers and that works well here as we see ""Graham"" try to work from a blank canvas, and with an insane convict, to track down a man who has left virtually nothing for them to go on. Petersen holds this together quite well and the cleverly cast Cox, well he always comes across as an actor who'd be quite prepared to eat the competition. I found the ending just a little rushed, but the jigsaw is well presented and the jeopardy effectively increased throughout this quite chilling adaptation. Honestly - I didn't much care for the intrusively synthesised score - just a little too much ""Miami Vice"" for me - but this is a solid and at times quite gripping story of imbalance and mania that I did quite enjoy.",7.0
11455,"**A good example of how irresponsible and careless cinema can be when it wants to convey messages to the public.**

I have already said, in other reviews of other films, that I see cinema as a leisure experience and as a form of artistic expression. At its core, this is cinema. However, there are so many films that seek to indoctrinate and convey political or social messages that it is not easy for us to forget that the industrial and propaganda machine linked to the movies is perfect for the mass “brainwashing” of crowds. It's something I don't like and it's even dangerous, taking into account that it can be used for good or bad, depending on the message being conveyed. And the message that this film sends us is one of tremendous social irresponsibility!

Released in 1978, at a time when American cinema still felt the strong influence of hippies and the ideals of a libertarian and counterculture Left, the film begins by revealing two very different characters (a poor Latino and a well-born and spoiled rich man) who unite in their love for drugs, and especially marijuana (or weed). The script is non-existent and underwritten: the characters limit themselves to an incessant and eager search for more and more drugs, ending up returning from Mexico with a van made of weed and leaving a trail of smoke and people accidentally stoned, and apparently very happy with that.

The film is one of those films that Hollywood should be ashamed of: it is a great apology for the consumption, liberal and recreational, of a varied cocktail of drugs, which starts with weed and ends with acids, “speeds” and heroin. The amount of substances mentioned in the film is vast and the way in which the subject is approached should have led to legal actions and arrest warrants against the actors, producers, studio and director, in order to answer for this irresponsible and inconsequential movie. And if the reader finds that too drastic, I leave you the question: would it be reasonable or good that they had released a comedy that made a sympathetic or pleasant portrayal of Nazism, or the Holocaust? Yes, one thing has nothing to do with the other! But there are reasonable limits for everything, including comedy, and there are themes that are simply not meant to make people laugh. I don't mean by this to say that I think the film was instrumental in increasing drug use, or that all the people who saw it went out and bought some weed. But if we, as a society, start to allow certain reprehensible acts and behaviors to be seen in a careless way, this gradually becomes ingrained in people's minds.

In addition to this issue of moral and social irresponsibility, the film also has a perfect bad taste humor: I've never seen a film where the characters spend so much time in bathrooms, or vomiting. If that's funny, I didn't see any joke, but maybe it's my mistake, after all, I wasn't born or live in a cave, and my parents gave me a good education. Technically, the only aspects worthy of mention are the vehicles, starting with the VW Beetle modified with Rolls-Royce parts and ending with the very green van that appears in the biggest slice of the film. Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong deserve the Golden Raspberry and are absolutely deplorable, as actors and as comedians.

Personally, I am in favor of banning this film, on moral and educational grounds. However, it can even be seen if it is properly framed and accompanied by explanations about the danger of drug use. Lucky for us, there are lots of films with good messages about that, and yes, cannabis is a drug like any other.",1.0
11459,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

This is one of the best superhero movies outside of DC and Marvel movies.  Not only does it use the silly costumes that I like from comics, but it incorporates it as part of normal life: the world is clearly built to show that Supers are somewhat normal to see, and that there is a community of them.  It's basically Professor X's school if people treated Mutants like the Avengers.

The immediate problems are in the the casting: there are SO MANY great people, almost everyone is funny and takes to their roles perfectly, but the lead, the focus of the story, is forgettable, and it is completely unbelievable that he would have these girls after him, let alone someone who we're happy to have powers.  And I hate Kurt Russell, but the movie is so good I forget he's in it until he suddenly appears and smarms it up.

A ""coming of age"" story, with ""high school politics"", and ""girl next door"" tropes all mixed together is a good recipe, and with super powers to keep it interesting.  I think that's the thing that makes this movie stand out.  Using the super powers, the movie is all about SHOW, don't tell.  A lot of movie forget this, overusing narration and dialogue out of place.

The content of the movie is all about meaningful dialogue, showing the world, and how it works.  It is also about being fun, they pay special detail to the scenes to keep it light and add something extra to the scenes.  Another thing that comedy movies forget is that a joke should compliment the movie, not stop it: there are so many little bits sewn into the movie that happen to the side (Larry being a 2-ton rock at a party), or as part of the world building (a hero support montage of utility belts).

The oddest parts of the movie deal with teens dating and their parents, it's perfectly apt, but you can feel the awkwardness of the situation.

Kurt Russell gives the only performance that I'll likely remember, but all the cast do their part - they are well cast, with none of them leaving anything to be desired to be honest.

The effects are good, while there are a couple of amusing gags thrown in. It's a simple and pretty predictable premise, but that doesn't stop it from being fun to watch. It could've, perhaps, worked better as a TV show? There are murmurs that that's what they plan to do soon, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

It turns out that ""Rippner"" (Cillian Murphy) needs her to contact the hotel in which she works and get them to move a visiting - and important - family to a new suite. Should she not acquiesce to this perfectly reasonable request, then he has a pal on the ground who is all set to bump off her father ""Joe"" (Brian Cox). For the first half an hour, this is quite an effective thriller - the dynamic between the two, with her hemmed into her increasingly claustrophobic airline seat, helps build quite a decent sense of peril. Sadly, though, as she begins to fight back the scenario begins to lose it's potency. His complete control of the situation begins to become more and more compromised as serendipity takes just bit too much of an interest in the story for my liking. That's not to say that ""Lisa"" need be a shrinking violet in the face of her psychological oppressor, it's just that the fightback is all just a bit far-fetched, before a rather messy and unsatisfying ending that you just know is going to happen. Murphy can be quite an edgy character actor - he is an attractive man with a hint of something underhand (I think he'd make a good ""Bond"" villain) and McAdams is confident and competent - it's just the originality of the story that peters out and becomes predictably mediocre.",6.0
11460,"Red Eye is a solid thriller that builds tension well, especially in its first act. The slow-paced setup allows for strong character introductions, but it does feel like Rachel McAdams' character should have picked up on Cillian Murphy's unsettling presence sooner. The second act loses some momentum, with certain scenes dragging more than necessary, but Wes Craven's direction keeps the suspense alive. The final act is where the movie really kicks into gear, delivering a satisfying climax. The script does a good job of balancing psychological tension with action, though some moments require a suspension of disbelief—especially regarding in-flight conversations that seemingly go unnoticed by passengers.

Cinematography is straightforward but effective, using tight framing to enhance the claustrophobic feel of the setting. Cillian Murphy brings an eerie, controlled intensity, while McAdams carries the film well with a believable performance. The supporting characters don’t add much, and the film occasionally misdirects attention to elements that don’t pay off. The score complements the suspense but isn’t particularly memorable. While not groundbreaking, Red Eye is an entertaining, well-crafted thriller that works best when it leans into its psychological tension rather than its action.",6.0
11462,"Could this be Cary Grant as his most benignly menacing?

His friend ""Gordon"" (Nigel Bruce) appears for a visit and soon some holes begin to emerge in her new husband's backstory. Further investigation reveals that lying is not something he has much difficulty with and after a few bumps on their road and when she discovers a letter from their insurers suggesting he was trying to borrow on her life policy, she begins to fear for her own life... Hitchcock's storytelling - at times the camerawork makes us feel like a peeping Tom - and Franz Waxman's tension-laden score add loads to this strongly character driven effort. Bruce shines as the jovial gent to whom ""Lina"" takes rather a liking, Fontaine herself treads the cinematographic line between reason and paranoia with some considerable skill - but it is Grant who really stands out. His character is likeable, plausible and if you've ever read Anthony Berkeley's rather wordy book ""Before the Fact"" then you'll recognise that his portrayal is really pretty spot on - can we believe him, do we (want to) believe him - and at the end, well....

11463,"Stirring chest beater for those prepared to indulge. 

You don't need me to give you a history lesson here, Battle Of Britain, much like 98% of all war movies is a glossed up extension of an historical event, if you want history then go read all the serious historian comments instead.

Wanna read about a film? OK, Battle Of Britain is something of a frustrating love of mine, I'm not one to be over enthused as regards jingoistic fervour, but there are a handful of films that really have me pounding my chest like some flag waving King Kong clone, Battle Of Britain, in spite of the obvious flaws is one such film. The plus points will always outweigh the bad for me, as a top array of acting talent line up to tell the tale of the British Air Force fighting the good fight against the German Air Force for control of British air space - and thus stopping the Nazis from invading England on the south coast. It should be noted that the film gains extra credit for giving the due respect to the other European countries that also fought in the Battle for the skies in 1940.

The aerial sequences are a delight, it's easy to see where the main portion of the budget went here, be it dogfights or squadrons looming ominously in the sky, the effects are never less than good, and some of the POV cockpit shots firmly have the blood pumping. The climatic battle (played out to an almost operatic score) is deftly shot and is a riveting reel of film that pays you back for having sat through one of the film's flaws, that of the sadly scripted moments of tedium. 

True enough to say that the film is a bit overlong, and whilst it's smart in portraying the reality of pilots under prepared, it just comes across as at times like boorish filler, while the inevitable love interest strand involving Susannah York is not only pointless, it's also bloody annoying. The score is hit and miss as well, at times Ron Goodwin & Henry Walton's music lights up the proceedings as the planes swoop and conquer, but does the operatic switch for the film's final battle enhance the picture? I would say no because the harshness of battle gives way to swan lake like indulgence, it's not for me I have to say. 

Still, I don't think anyone is proclaiming this as a masterpiece, it entertains far above average, and for this viewer at least, it makes me proud for a couple of hours at least. Lest we ever forget the real life heroes of The Battle of Britain. 7/10",7.0
11463,"It's 1940 and the ebullient Reichsmarschall (Hein Riess) arrives in his powder blue uniform to inspire his invincible Luftwaffe in their imminent reduction of the RAF to a pile of bombed out aerodromes and blazing aircraft. Across the channel, Sir Hugh Dowding (Sir Laurence Olivier) is trying to organise His Majesty's forces - outnumbered by something like four to one, to thwart that ambition. The next couple of hours demonstrate just how the British - helped by a disparate collection of dispossessed European allies from Poland, Czechoslovakia and France as well as many from Commonwealth nations fought the eponymous battle. Rather than just follow an historical chronology, though, the narrative uses the lives and loves of a series of characters - from both sides of the water - to illustrate the horrors of war, the strains on relationships and the strength of friendships and loyalty. We know what happened, so there's little jeopardy, but a combination of Ron Goodwin's scoring and some superb aerial photography help to elevate this above any accusations that it's a propagandist, even gloating, exercise. It's hard to imagine anyone being able to assemble quite the cast that Guy Hamilton has here and each familiar face plays a part in presenting this collage of stories and events the empowered the battle for the very survival of the nation against an enemy that was well equipped, disciplined and believed God was on it's side, too.",7.0
11468,"My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a trumpet player.

The Salton Sea is directed by D. J. Caruso and written by Tony Gayton. It stars Val Kilmer, Vincent D'Onofrio, Peter Sarsgard, Doug Hutchinson, Anthony LaPaglia, Debora Kara Unger, Adam Goldberg and Luis Guzmán. Music is scored by Thomas Newman and cinematography by Amir Mokri.

Danny Parker (Kilmer) is hanging out with a bunch of methamphetamine users, apparently in an effort to numb the pain of his one time life that saw his wife murdered. Or is he? The word of mouth for it was strong, but no sooner did it hit cinemas than it disappeared off the face of the earth. However, the cult cinema world is often a vibrant place to lurk, enter there and you find The Salton Sea, a wonderfully tricksy and off beat neo-noir awash with misery, revenge, redemption and odd ball characters that are either stuck in purgatory, or heading to nowhereville.

Protagonist Danny Parker leads the film, a man whose identity is fractured after being dealt a blow from the hands of fate, very much in limbo mentally, he none the less has goals to achieve, nothing is never quite as it seems until director Caruso wants us in on the side-shifts. Danny is often in the company of danger and weird characters, from a hopped up harpoon wielding loon, to a no nose psycho (too much meth up the nose will make you lose it kids), via dirty cops and meth heads, it's a world of unease, the twisty plot drawing the viewer in with a kinky smile on its face.

Caruso also pulls off the neat trick of placing humour in this off kilter world without hurting the dramatic harshness of the thematics. There's a quite brilliant sequence that shows a botched crime being attempted by the meth head crew, this we watch at the same time as they discuss about actually pulling the crime off. That it involves a stool sample from Bob Hope should tell you all you need to know about the intelligence of the wannabe perps! Caruso's camera is fluid and he uses certain neo-noir visual tricks of the trade as well (time lapses etc), and he also has a knack for varying the mood without averting the slowly bubbling to the surface pace that the story requires.

Kilmer is superb, perfectly low-key, there is no need for rage, the yearning for revenge and redemption, for identity, is brought out via calmly delivered dialect, and it's very affecting. D'Onofrio as Pooh Bear, the afore mentioned no nose fella, steals the movie with another of his off the planet nut-jobs. Elsewhere, Sarsgard is as appealing as he has ever been as Danny's stoner best mate, Hutchinson and LaPaglia cut fine figures as dirty cops, while Guzmán and Danny Trejo leave an impressively grungy mark. The only disappointment is the lack of screen time for Kara Unger, a fine actress, she is playing what turns out to be a critical femme fatale role, but really we needed more of her. It's a rare misstep in an otherwise cracking neo-noir that is highly recommended to fans of similarly devilishly fun pictures. 8.5/10",8.0

Released in 2001, ""Jason X"" starts in the year 2010 where the government decides to finally stop Jason by putting him into frozen stasis. He and another person are revived in the year 2455 by a professor and his students who are on a field trip from Earth Two to Earth One. Jason is unleashed on their spaceship and havoc ensues.

This entry is like 1979's ""Alien"" except with Jason as the monster and a sense of humor. You'll also notice that it's a great departure for the series putting Jason in space in the future. Most Friday fans look down on 1993's ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X"" because the producers tried something new. It's obvious that they felt the series had become stale and formulaic with an incredible eight-installment run from 1980-1989. I felt ""Jason Goes to Hell"" had a refreshing concept (ripped off from 1987's ""The Hidden"") and a great intro & opening act, but the tone was distasteful and the flick eventually spiraled out of control with its cartoony quasi-horror gobbledygook; still, it featured a couple of the best women in the series (Agent Marcus and Deborah), which should be commended.

I heard negative comments about ""Jason X"" over the years, but the first half is sci-fi at its best with some amusing elements thrown in for good measure. It’s stunning how well the filmmakers handle the sci-fi aspects of the plot and F/X. The second half, unfortunately, becomes too cartoonish as Jason systematically annihilates most of the crew, particularly when he gets his new futuristic look, basically morphing into SuperJason (rolling my eyes).

As usual, this installment features an impressive assortment of women, but it's only Kinsa (Melody Johnson) that I find appealing, except for the cameo of the campfire teen #1 at the end, played by the stunning Mika Ward. They should have included her in the main cast.

During my schooling as a teenager there were a handful of films that it was deemed cool to love, The Wanderers, Scum, Quadrophenia and The Warriors, and it's perhaps a weird thing to say... but I still feel here in my middle age that these are still cool films to be adored and cherished.

I have just sat through The Warriors again for about the hundredth time in my life, and it still entertains me as much now as it did back then, sure it's dated, sure I see more cheese than I thought it had back then, but I also see a visually tight movie that actually delves interestingly into the lives and psyche of young gangers.

The plot is simple, all the gangs of New York City are called to a meeting where they are called to unite to take over the city, the leader of the gang known as The Riffs is a guy called Cyrus who is the one calling for the unity. He is shot and killed during the rally and The Warriors are wrongly framed for his murder. The Warriors then have to make their way back home to Coney Island with every gang in the city out to kill them, and also with the police hot on their tail as well. This journey is excellent as we are introduced to a number of gangs trying to get the better of The Warriors, the fights are well choreographed, the clothes are wonderful, and some of the dialogue is now teenage folklore.

The film was criticised on release for glamorising gangs, but I fail to see how this opinion was formed, if anything, when analysing the main characters, the film has a sad streak running through it. Be that as it may, the films triumph is getting the will of the viewer to hopefully see the unfairly tarnished Warriors make it home to Coney Island, which builds to the climax of the film that is both poignant and punch the air greatness. 8/10",8.0

Led by ""Swan"" (Michael Beck) they must run a gauntlet of other avenging gangs and try to establish just who pulled the trigger.

He knows from the start that the previous occupant tried to kill herself by jumping from the window, and that she is still clinging on in hospital, so he goes to visit her and encounters her pal ""Stella"" (Isabelle Adjani). She's a bit of a live wire and that doesn't sit well in his new lodgings where a library-like atmosphere is actively encouraged. Indeed, before long he begins to feel that his neighbours are engaged in a plot to force him out, or even worse. He's hearing noises, voices; he's imagining things. Or is he? His flat is broken into; he fears that someone is going to try and kill him as he sleeps. In short, paranoia is taking a firm hold of this man. What also doesn't help is the fact that he is becoming increasingly obsessed with the (now deceased) previous occupant, and that leads to significant changes to his frequently erratic behaviour too. Is all of this real or is he just losing the plot? Polanski delivers well here, as does Adjani but it's really the whole concept that makes this interesting. It reminded me a little of ""Rosemary's Baby"". Not in any Satanic fashion, but in the way the claustrophobia of his dwelling with  animosity on all sides; his own personality instinctively weak, susceptible and all in the face of a danger that might be real, or then again...

Norman Jewison and William Harrison expand Harrison’s short story into a full length feature film, with great results. Story takes place in 2018 and the world is a global corporate state, a hegemony of six ruling cartels. There are no wars, poverty and etc, so the cartels provide the antidote to pent up frustrations with Rollerball, a bloodthirsty arena sport where no quarter is given or taken. But when the sports number one star, Jonathan E, becomes a free spirit and too big for the sport, the corporations aim to retire him…

Headed by a superb James Caan as Jonathan, the performances are from the high end, the photography superb and the action during the games themselves is beautifully choreographed. The use of classical music to run concurrent with the themes in the narrative is smartly rendered to the tricksy plot, while the writing is sharp and deserving of the utmost attention from the viewer. It’s folly to suggest that when the film is away from the Rollerball ring it sags a touch, so patience is required and a respect of literate posturing is also expected to get the most out of it.

He also tries to find out just who is behind his dismissal - and why, and luckily has the help of ""Cletus"" (Moses Gunn) on that particular quest as his options narrow and ""Bartholomew"" becomes ever so slightly more menacing. The action scenes with the ball and skaters racing around the track is quite scintillating to watch with intense photography and plenty of high-speed tumbles, but the rest of it is all sort of ""Logan's Run"" with an Houseman who really only knew how to play one role. That worked well in the ""Paper Chase"" (1973) but here, it's just a bit underwhelming. Caan puts his heart and soul into the story, but there are too many holes in that to resonate beyond the obvious and rather undercooked swipe at a sterile authoritarianism that reminds us of the Nero and the Coliseum style of entertainment for the obedient (or else!) masses. It's fine - but nothing more.",6.0

Judith Barsi’s performance as Anne-Marie is unforgettable. Knowing she recorded her final scenes before her tragic passing adds a bittersweet layer to the movie. Her voice carries so much warmth and innocence, making the character even more special. The final scene, where Charlie redeems himself for her, is especially poignant and feels like a beautiful tribute to Judith’s bright spirit.

11498,"Kenneth Branagh's first film, **HENRY V**, was a critical triumph.  But since it was a Shakespeare story, it is overlooked as high-brow. With **DEAD AGAIN** as his sophomore directorial effort, Branagh has a film for the popcorn crowd.  If **HENRY V** was tonally like a Laurence Olivier film, **DEAD AGAIN** is tonally like an Alfred Hitchcock movie.
Filmed in 2 eras, in both color and black and white, with characters portraying multiple characters,  a private eye, reincarnation,  a fortune teller even a _femme fatale_ suffering from amnesia!  Obviously **DEAD AGAIN** is a suspense thriller of old. 

The screenplay by Scott Frank - screenwriter of **OUT OF SIGHT**, **GET SHORTY** and **MINORITY REPORT**- is taut and exciting.  Branagh's creative use of camera and the thundering musical score by his musical alter ego, Patrick Doyle, marry well with that script.

Once again, Branagh carries the film in front and behind the camera.  This time taking on 2 different roles, as does his one-time wife Emma Thompson.  While some from his Shakespeare community appear in other roles, Branagh embraces his first Hollywood film by bringing on board American actors, like Andy Garcia and Robin Williams.

In the end, story is king in **DEAD AGAIN**.  It is fun and exciting and easily one of the best films of 1991.

It missed the opportunity there. Possibly because it was only an interview, possibly because the results of which didn't really matter, either way it missed the tension boat and the film ultimately suffers for it. What could have been All the President's Men turned into something well done, but ultimately forgettable for failure to really develop the mood to set the pace.

It was the latter who initiated a proposal with lawyer ""Swifty"" Lazar (Toby Jones) to suggest the president might like to tell his story. The Nixon camp considered Frost a bit of a manageable lightweight and decide that if he can raise the $600,000 cash, then why not? It takes a while to negotiate the terms, but by 1977 all is agreed and they sit down for the first in a series of two hour recordings. Despite a strong start, opinions seem to solidify around Frost being, indeed, a bit too weak to elicit anything newsworthy from his savvy political opponent. Luckily, Frost has the viscerally anti-Nixon James Reston (Sam Rockwell) in his camp and some serious research unearths things that are going to make it very difficult for Nixon to continue to try to remain as aloof and statesmanlike as he would like. It's Langella who really comes into his own as, believe it or not, he actually engenders a little sympathy towards the conclusion. That's all history so no jeopardy there, but I think the characterisation of the president was solid and engagingly delivered an image of a man who definitely believed in himself! Sheen is adequate, as is the weakly cast Matthew Macfadyen as producer John Birt and Kevin Bacon as Nixon's right hand man and borderline disciple Jack Brennan. The writing is occasionally potent here and as we are exposed to Ron Howard's version of events, it gradually becomes quite a compelling postulation to watch and opine about.",7.0
11502,"Released in 1962, <i>Knife in the Water</i> (Polish: <i>Nóz w wodzie</i>) was director Roman Polanski's full-length debut. Married couple Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are driving to the marina when they pick up a hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz). Though Andrzej is initially angry at the young man for standing the middle of the road, he invites him to come sailing. Once on the boat, tension arises between the two men because of Krystyna sexual appeal and the hitchhiker's poverty versus Andrzej's affluence. Not only is the title a metaphor for the boat as it moves through the lake, but it also refers to the intimidating knife that the young man carries with him.

<i>Knife in the Water</i> is entertaining enough. The cinematography on the lake and the low-key soundtrack by jazz legend Krzysztof Komeda are memorable. But personally I don't find this to be an especially great film. It feels derivative of Italian cinema of the time, without an original touch. The casting of the weathered, 32 year-old Malanowicz as a 19 year-old student undermines its credibility. I suspect that the film gained so much attention on release due to its risque nature (especially novel in a film from the Eastern Bloc) instead of its intrinsic merit.",6.0
11507,"De Palma Double Bubble, Toil and Trouble.

Body Double is directed by Brian De Palma, he also co-writes the screenplay with Robert J. Avrech. It stars Craig Wasson, Melanie Griffith, Gregg Henry, Deborah Shelton, Guy Boyd and Dennis Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Stephen H. Burum.

Brian De Palma continued his crusade to push buttons of the sensitive whilst homaging his hero Alfred Hitchcock, with this cheeky, garish, sleazy thriller. Even when moving away from Hitch like movies, he created a storm with Scarface (1983), so the critics of 1984 wondered if a return to suspense thriller territory would put the director back on an even cinematic keel? Not a bit of it! The reaction to Body Double was ridiculously over the top, apparently a misogynistic homage to the porn industry, with exploitation gore thrown in for good (bad) measure, Body Double was the devil's spawn in the eyes of critics. The public? Not so much, film was a sure fire hit at the box office.

Of course today it seems all very tame, where not even a simulated drilling killing can raise the temperature of the audience, or that frank sexual language and bare bodies no longer makes cinema goers blush. On reflection now it's easy to view De Palma's movie as a visionary piece of work, a film gently poking the ribs of Hollywood and the MPAA, and as was always the case with his 70s and 80s work, he was a director who easily elicited a response from his audience. And with his box of cinematic tricks still impressive before he became over reliant on them, Body Double is a fascinatingly lurid viewing experience.

That it's Vertigo and Rear Window spliced together is a given, but that doesn't make it a bad film, besides which it bears the De Palma stamp as well, undeniably so. Plot finds Jake Scully (Wasson), a struggling actor with claustrophobia, thrust into a world of murder, obsession, deceit and paranoia, for when he house sits for a newly acquired friend, he spies a sexy lady through the telescope apparently being stalked by an odd looking Native American. To reveal more would spoil the fun of anyone watching for the first time, but suffice to say that Jake has entered the realm where neo-noir protagonists wander around wondering how and why they are in this mess.

It's pulpy and pappy, but in the best ways possible, and unlike many other films made by directors who ventured into similar territory, it's never boring (hello Sliver). Cast are appropriately cartoonish or animated, the twists fun if not hard to see coming, and with De Palma's visual panache cosying up nicely with Donaggio's musical score, Body Double is fine entertainment brought to us by a director with a glint in his eye. 8/10",7.5
11507,"Body Double infiltrates the vehemence of adult entertainment through inspired Hitchcockian thrills. De Palma was at the height of his success during the eighties. Implementing his technical flourishes within sub-genres that we’re not necessarily accessible for the average audience member. Erotic thrillers, whilst some may describe as distasteful and misogynistic, accentuated sexualisation to further enhance the lust of man. Body Double is no different. Much like the pornographic industry that is portrayed, it certainly has a sub-par screenplay that persuades you to fast-forward to the “act” in question, yet manages to lure you into the sleazy allurement of De Palma’s technically adept direction.

After waltzing in on his partner cheating on him, a novice actor is recruited by a friend to house-sit a luxury abode, conveniently positioned adjacently to another property hosting a sumptuous succubus of temptation. Naturally, downbeat and fuelled by anger, he resorts to peeping and spying as she provocatively dances in front of the window before proceeding to creepily follow her the next day.

As the main man himself stated, this is inspired by Hitchcock’s two greatest thrillers: ‘Rear Window’ and ‘Vertigo’. The added eroticism granting De Palma’s feature a differing (if unpleasantly salty...) flavour that uniquely defines its narrative qualities. Initially, the first act kicked off with a mundane imitation of Hitchcock’s aforementioned ‘Rear Window’, opening itself up to comparative criticisms. The introductory setup, outlining Wasson’s Jake Scully as a claustrophobic unconfident mess, sent the plot down a one-way route that, upon first thought, had minimal opportunities for a U-turn. The convenience of the telescope as Scully unashamedly invades the privacy of his new temporary neighbour and his dreadful tailing techniques complementing his mediocre onscreen acting portrayals, sent my own thoughts down the predictable avenue. Was Scully a perverted mess, or was he being set up? I thought I knew. But then De Palma trapped me.

Through ornate neo-noir aesthetics and a vapid insight into the world of adult entertainment, he precariously planted a sufficient amount of false breadcrumbs to force me to second guess myself. And that I did. The mystery slowly unraveling, accompanied by a smooth monosyllabic score and Frankie Goes To Hollywood’s legendary gay anthem “Relax”, unlocking the intentions of all characters involved. Heightening the glossy lifestyle of adult performers, De Palma‘s directorial flair, mostly consisting of extended takes and distant shots, invited audiences into a tainted environment plagued by primitive regression. Tantalising voyeurism and dangerous obsession. Even hints of Argento’s influence of the giallo sub-genre.

Various techniques, especially the continuous panoramic 360 revolving as Wasson and Shelton questionably embraced each other, resembled dated homages that failed to match the noir aesthetics that De Palma meticulously crafted. The conclusive ten minutes unfortunately unwrapped certain revelations in an underwhelming manner, by having the story abruptly cut with no substantial resolution. This left myself viewing the proceeding credits montage with an overbearing feeling of unsatisfactory bewilderment.

Undoubtedly, Body Double is rough around the edges. Occasionally bypassing substantial development for evocative voyeuristic tendencies. But that does not deter from De Palma’s intrinsic cinematic approach, where the night life of Hollywood truly becomes illuminated.",7.0
11509,"Hi Ho Silver!

Silverado is directed by Lawrence Kasdan and Lawrence co-writes with his brother Mark. It stars Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, Kevin Costner, Brian Dennehy, Jeff Goldblum Linda Hunt and Rosanna Arquette. Music is by Bruce Broughton and cinematography by John Bailey.

As a big Western fan it's most interesting revisiting Silverado some 30 odd years after its release. In context of the time it first came out, when the genre was a dead duck, it was a bold and beautiful romp. How wonderful to find that with one or two 1980s irks aside, it is still a fine Western beast beating a true genre heart.

Ok, it's hardly pulling up trees thematically, in the main because it embraces what it homages, every cliche in scene and writing is respectful to its predecessors, the Kasdan's achieving everything they set out to do - entertain like minded film lovers.

Cast are on fine form, clearly enjoying the material and setting of such. The locations are outstanding, the vistas gorgeous, with production design to match. Broughton's musical score is rambunctious and lifts the spirit, even if much of it feels 1980s as opposed to the era of films setting. Action scenes are expertly staged, the improbable irrelevant for joyous rewards, and stunt work high end as well.

Themes such as prostitution and racism are only given small acknowledgements, but character building is evident at every turn to fully involve audience from first reel to last. Heroes and anti-heroes, psychos, thieves and power hungry villains, no stone left unturned here.  This isn't for those after the grim textures of something like Unforgiven and latterly Hostiles, this is more in keeping with something like Tombstone, or even the much divisive Lone Ranger.

11509,"**Fun, rip-Roaring Western with too many characters in a complicated story**

Released in 1985, ""Silverado"" is a Western about two brothers (Scott Glenn & Kevin Costner) and two other gents (Kevin Kline & Danny Glover) who become friends and ultimately team-up to take on the corrupt sheriff of the New Mexican town Silverado.

The first time I watched ""Silverado"" was in the mid-90s and I was turned off by the implausibility of the prison break scene in the first act, not to mention the nigh goofiness of Costner's character. There's an unrealistic vibe, almost verging on Indiana Jones territory, which is easy to explain since writer/director Lawrence Kasdan also wrote ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981). So it's necessary to accept the implausible heroics to glean from (and enjoy) the meat of the picture, which is essentially a serious story running the gamut of the human condition (e.g. injustice, action, drama, comedy, conflict, etc.).

I only bring this up so that viewers who favor realism in their Westerns, like ""Shane"" (1953), ""True Grit"" (1969/2010), ""The Long Riders"" (1980), ""Unforgiven"" (1992) or ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994), will make the necessary mental adjustments before attempting to digest the film. ""Silverado"" is a rip-roaring, rollicking Western in the truest sense. There are a few moral ambiguities (e.g. Jeff Goldblum's character and Paden's conundrum in the story) but, for the most part, the heroes are heroes and the villains drip with evil.

One aspect of ""Silverado"" I like, which most post-50s Westerns lack, is the palpable spirit of life, liberty and joy that the heroes & their friends possess. Despite the various evils they experience (which we can all relate to one way or another) they maintain a certain joy of living, the jubilance of life and freedom itself. As such, the film isn't a downer; it's somehow uplifting.

Stories like this need a good villain and Brian Dennehy more than fills the bill. He's almost horrifying as the swaggering corrupt sheriff of Silverado. Remember his part as the sheriff in ""First Blood"" (1982)? This is essentially the same role, just exponentially WORSE.

The main hero is Kline as Paden. Kline is effective at playing the perfect, likable everyman. Glenn is a quintessential Westerner as Emmett while Costner plays his younger gung-ho brother, Jake. The latter is notably different here than in his other Western roles, ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) ""Wyatt Earp"" and ""Open Range"" (2003). Here he's young & spunky, full of mirth, yet also an expert and deadly gunslinger.

After the contrivances and goofiness of the first act, ""Silverado"" finds its footing and I was absorbed & even thrilled by the story up until around the 70-75-minute mark. Unfortunately, from there the story gets convoluted, although it ends with a long, rousing gunfight in the town. It's just that there are so many characters that you tend to lose track and it seems like some expositional scenes were left on the cutting room floor in order to keep the runtime at just over two hours (133 minutes). The subplots concerning Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Goldblum and Linda Hunt are good examples. However, the positive thing about a story like this is that it's not superficial; hence, the movie's worthy of repeat viewings since you're not likely gonna digest it all in just one or two viewings. Yet an intricate story like this needs at least 2.5 hours of runtime in order to breath and be effective. It demands the length of ""Dances with Wolves"" and so I'd be interested in seeing a Director's Cut.

Speaking of subplots, I enjoyed certain ones like Kline's love for the midget saloon bartender (Linda Hunt), love in a son/mother sense, that is, but their relationship isn't developed enough. You have to read in between the lines. I also appreciated the love and loyalty of the four protagonists; the fact that Glover is a black man is of no issue. Love in its purest sense is spiritual in nature and transcends blood, skin color or raw lust. You never know who you'll meet in life and form a strong love-bond with. It's amazing.

So why not a higher rating? I didn't find the story all that captivating like, say, Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon"" (1991). I'm talking about the last hour where I had to struggle a bit to keep attentive, not to mention keep track of all the characters and what's going on. Then there's the nonsensical editing, obvious missing scenes and a few idiotic implausibilities. Beyond these negatives, ""Silverado"" has most everything you'd ever want in a Western: gunfights, quick-draw showdowns, smoke-filled saloons, saloon girls, homesteaders, wagon trains, outlaws, posses, jailbreaks, stampedes, box canyons, glorious Western locations, and more. Actually, it verges on overkill. About the only thing it doesn't have are Native Americans and an uncomplicated story. The latter explains why you DON'T see ""Silverado"" cited on many Best Westerns lists.

The film was shot entirely in New Mexico.

GRADE: C+",5.0
11509,"Written (along with his brother) and directed by Lawrence Kasdan (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Wyatt Earp), Silverado is one Western that remounts to the golden age of westerns - when I had put the movie on my to watch list, I surely thought it was some lost western from the 70´s.

But alas, no it was a mid-80's to 90's transition movie what gave me some concerns, that proved wrong otherwise. The director doesn't have so many hits in his career other that RotLA, but it is simple in screenplay but not naive as most of the 50-60's westerns with some greater tone on violence and blood.

It tells the story of 4 cowboys, two of them brothers, united by their own reasons, they being played by Kevin Kline and Kevin Costner, a black man with a vow of vengeance Danny Glover (that points the story around the 1870-80) and the lone wolf Scott Glenn that saves the first one that lead to encounters with the others..

The way off all 4 points to the city of Silverado, on which an ex-""friend"" of Scott is the ruthless and abusive sheriff (Brian Dennehy, one of the best roles on the movie along with the saloon owner Linda Hunt - another great star on the movie, with just 1,45cm height that you have seen and heard many times in your live I assure you).

The movie for sure have its share of action and relations betweens characters, and a degree of violence that differentiate it of older westerns.

Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) is different to most kids at school. Being solely raised by her unemployed father, Jack (Harry Dean Stanton), and dressing in hand made clothes, she's very much from the wrong side of the tracks. It's tough in school as Andie and her pals are looked down on by the more wealthy students who make up the majority of the student body. With the prom on the horizon, Andie is feeling a little more bluer than normal, but hope comes in the form of Blane McDonough (Andrew McCarthy), a so called rich kid, who in spite of peer pressure asks Andie to the prom. This is something that alienates Andie and Blane from their so called friends.

As it turned out, ""Pretty In Pink"" was another in the line of John Hughes films that really hit the mark with the teenagers of the time. In fact it's fair to say it impacted with almost everyone who had suffered a less than straight forward climb through some angsty teenage years. It's not a perfect piece by any stretch of the imagination, for at times it's twee and at others a little trite, it is nevertheless a finely crafted piece that deals with teen perils and the ugliness of class division. Unfortunately the class divide is something that rarely gets associated with the pic, because focus tends to be drawn to the love story at its heart. Which is a shame, because although audience expectation will undoubtedly be met in that department, Hughes has plotted it nicely to make a valid point. There is also the real notable thread of the single parent here, where the single parent is a man and a man who is unable to break free of the escalating distress caused by the break up of his marriage to Andie's mother. The two best serious scenes in the film both involve the father/daughter axis, where both Ringwald and H.D. Stanton are simply terrific. Comedy relief comes in the form of Andie's best pals, Duckie (Jon Cryer our hero) and Iona (Annie Potts), with both characters neatly inserted into the structure of the piece. While the direction from Howard Deutch is careful and brings about reality based performances from the predominantly youthful cast.

For his first full length theatrical feature, Michael Mann announced himself to the film world with some distinction, and in the process showed everyone what style of film making makes him tick. Thief is a film of stylised grit, visually, thematically and narratively. Set and filmed in Chicago, Mann, aided by Thorin, shoots the story through pure neo-noir filters. 

At nighttime it is all a beautifully neon drenched haze, where the streets shimmer with dampness, a dampness brought about by the rain and god knows what else! By day there's a sweaty hue, a feeling that the heat is well and truly on, that even in daylight Frank isn't safe, his dreams may be a touch too far to reach. And no matter what the scene or scenario, Tangerine Dream are laying over the top a throbbing pulse beat, it's like The Warriors trying to get back to Coney Island, the music has a sense of dread about it, that danger is at every corner. 

This part of Chicago stinks, it's a vile and corrupt place. Dirty cops everywhere, underworld criminals ruling the roost - Hell! You can even buy a baby if you want one. Is it any wonder that Frank just wants to settle down with a wife and child, to walk barefooted in the sea, to have domesticity? But Frank, as smart, tough and savvy as he is, seems to thrive on the edge of things, with Mann giving him earthy and honest dialogue to engage us with, marking him out as an identifiable everyman protagonist who just happens to be an exceptional thief. 

Mann's attention to detail is on show straight away, none more so than with the two key safe cracking jobs that are undertaken. Using genuine jewel thieves as technical advisers on the film, these sequences ooze realism, from the tools used, the pre-planning and the execution of the takes, it smacks of reality and does justice to the genuine feel of the characterisations brought alive by the superb cast. And finally Mann delivers a finale of ambiguity, a noir shaded piece of abruptness, an ending that perfectly fits the whole production. 9/10",9.0

11527,"***Eccentric depiction of the medieval myths surrounding King Arthur*** 

In the late 400s Merlin the sorcerer of Britain takes advantage of the lust of King Uther (Gabriel Byrne) for a Duke’s wife, Ingrayne (Katrine Boorman), to grant him a boy who becomes King Arthur of Camelot (Nigel Terry) when he pulls Excalibur from the stone, a magical sword. Arthur marries Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi), but when Lancelot (Nicholas Clay) joins the Knights of the Round Table the two experience a profound affinity for each other. Meanwhile, Arthur’s half-sister, Morgana (Helen Mirren) is intent on incestuous deception to produce a son, Mordred.

The script to this acclaimed 1981 film by John Boorman was adapted from Sir Thomas Malory's “Le Morte d'Arthur” (“The Death of Arthur”), published in 1485. The Arthurian folklores are used as an allegory of the succession of birth, life, decline, and renewal. The resulting film is reminiscent of works of mythography and is therefore episodic in nature. For instance, the sequence where the concept of the Round Table is established comes and goes in an awkward way. Another example is at the 95-minute mark where the story switches to the Knights’ search for the Holy Grail, which focuses on a heretofore unknown knight.

Needless to say, the story’s not consistently compelling because the movie’s too segmented. The middle part detailing the romance between Guenevere and Lancelot, and the ramifications thereof, is the best part as far as that goes. The first half hour is a little convoluted, story-wise, and I suggest using the subtitles to discern accented dialogue and to keep track of the odd names. The search for the Holy Grail in the last 45 minutes breaks the film’s momentum because it feels tacked on.

Nevertheless, if you can roll with the hammy acting, the melodrama and the episodic framework, there are a lot of positives to enjoy. Some good examples include: the beautiful sylvan locations, the fairy tale-like castles & sets, the imaginative costumes (e.g. the armor), the lovely ladies and the lush colors. Also, the soundtrack/score, which greatly utilizes “O Fortuna” by Carl Orff and a few pieces by Richard Wagner, is notable. Meanwhile, watch out for a young Liam Neeson as the knight Gawain.  

The big flaw here is that the story lacks steady thrust. For that, check out the more reality-oriented “First Knight” (1995) and “King Arthur” (2004).      

The film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes and was shot entirely in Ireland.

It could just be the southerner in me, but watching Sweet Home Alabama feels a little like home. The small Alabama town with its historic buildings, tiny local bar, tight-knit community, lakes, and southern drawls remind me of how I grew up, which gives the movie some country flavor and a nostalgic vibe. There are some great funny moments, and watching the main characters develop throughout the film is pretty rewarding when it all comes together at the end.

11531,"**_Entertaining horror flick about a haunting witch that's been dead for over two centuries_**

Released in 2000 and directed by Joe Berlinger, ""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2"" begins amidst the hysteria of the found-footage of the first film. People from around the world curious about the Blair witch phenomenon overrun Burkittsville, Maryland, wherein an entrepreneurial dude named Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan) leads a 'Blair Witch Hunt' tour involving four clients, a Wiccan, a Goth girl and an academic couple. After camping at the ruins of the home of an executed murderous hermit (who was evidently possessed by the spirit of the witch in the 1940s) the group has a rude awakening when they can't remember what happened the night before. They go to Jeff's nearby pad—a curious factory-turned-house—to review the video tapes for answers and discover something horribly macabre.

Atmospherically, ""Book of Shadows"" is quite effective as a haunting ghost/witch flick and the writing is actually smart—the entire play on hysteria, delusion & perception is quite clever. The screenplay was written by director Berlinger, who's best known for the great ""Paradise Lost"" trilogy of documentaries about the ""West Memphis three,"" youthful outcasts accused of a hideous 1993 triple murder in Arkansas based on dubious evidence (and who were finally released in 2011). Anyway, ""Book of Shadows"" starts satirically and amusing, but gets increasing serious and sinister. The acting is good too, with Kim Director's powerhouse performance as the Goth girl standing out. Erica Leerhsen is also a highlight as the Wiccan babe with several alluring scenes, but they coulda done more with her.

The reason so many people call this flick ""the worst movie ever made"" (Why sure!) is obviously because it's a knee-jerk reaction to it being a sequel to the mega-popular ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999), which was an altogether different kind of movie, being a found-footage flick, not to mention the herd-mentality of an over-critical feeding-frenzy. Since I'm not a fan of found-footage films—seeing as how they're about as entertaining as watching home movies for an hour and a half—I find ""Book of Shadows"" far more interesting than the first film.

There's a secret message in the movie that you can discover in (***SPOILER ALERT***): the FIRE, the GRASS, the factory WINDOW, the GRAVESTONE and the RUG, which all-together spells: ""Seek me no further or..."". This combined with reversing Tristen's backward words in the last act reveal the secret of 'ESREVER': ""Seek me no further or... the children will again walk free,"" meaning: the Blair witch would loose the spirits of the murdered children to torment the invaders of her domain. (***END SPOILER***)

As for the complaints of there being no Book of Shadows, it's simply not true. The character Jeff is a movie enthusiast with ambitions of being a filmmaker and ""Book of Shadows"" is the name of one of the scripts he put together and intends to shoot. So it's not something totally out of nowhere that Artisan dubiously added to the title, as most people think. Yes, they added it, but it had relevance to the movie. Furthermore, the actual 'Book of Shadows' is a Wiccan spell book and is figuratively used in the movie in that the group obviously falls under the spell of the Blair Witch after entering her diabolical terrain.

The film features a creative score by Carter Burwell and a rockin' soundtrack with quality cuts by the likes of Marilyn Manson (""Disposable Teens""), Godhead (""The Reckoning"") and many more.

After Berlinger finished his version of the movie the studio complained that there weren't enough conventional horror elements and so additional scenes were shot & edited into the picture. What else is new? It has been thus throughout cinematic history. For me, the added scenes beef-up what might've otherwise been too low-key for a horror flick. True, this route was taken with the first film, but ""Book of Shadows"" is the antithesis of that movie, and it's the better for it IMHO.

""Book of Shadows"" is a dense horror flick and therefore worthy of repeat viewings for gems to mine. (One aid in helping to understand the picture is Jeff's statement at the camp: ""Film lies; video tells the truth""). Unfortunately, this is evidently too much for some dullards. Yes, it's a slow-build with meandering aspects, but the movie's laden with subtext and the climax is pretty horrific, even while it's somewhat predictable. You never see the witch, but her nefarious presence is palpable nevertheless and the ambiance fittingly oozes Gothic. As for the doofuses who argue that the pic has too little to do with the first one, nothing could be further from the truth. Lastly, Jeff's factory-turned-house is almost iconic; a great location for a ghostly horror flick.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Baltimore, Maryland.

11532,"**_Good rainforest movie marred by eye-rolling bits and tacked on eco message_**

An American engineer (Powers Boothe) takes his family to the Amazon Basin to build a major dam, but his son suddenly disappears and there are rumors that he may have been taken by a tribe called The Invisible People. Ten years pass and he’s still looking. Will he find him? Will the son (Charley Boorman) recognize him? Meg Foster is on hand as the wife/mother.

“The Emerald Forest” (1985) is similar to “A Man Called Horse” (1970) story-wise, albeit involving a teen, plus featuring the Amazon setting of “Fitzcarraldo” (1982). It influenced later movies like “Dances With Wolves” (1990) and, as far as ‘look’ goes, “Apocalypto” (2006). Being helmed by John Boorman, it’s a quality production.

Unfortunately, this is the least of these movies and therefore justifiably obscure. It’s not just the unnecessary environmental message in the second half but, worse, the laughable implication concerning a rain dance. (Why Sure!)

Isn't it ironic how “Natives” in the Americas are now adorned with god-like powers and sage-like stature in cinema? (I put ‘Natives’ in quotations because they’re actually the progeny of settlers from Asia via Beringia). If these Amazonian Indians had that much power, then taking care of the technologically advanced encroachers or enemy tribes would be a piece of cake.

Another criticism is the unrealistic portrayal of The Invisible People. It’s way too paradisal with too little emphasis on the mundaneness and hardships inherent to such a life in the deep equatorial forest. For instance, the nubile females appear overly fresh and immaculate for living amidst gross jungle challenges. In other words, they seem like girls who’ve lived a relatively soft life with modern conveniences (I’ve seen the real-life articles/photos in National Geographic and they’re very different). Both “Apocalypto” and “At Play in the Fields of the Lord” (1991) offer a less fantastical portrayal.

The story was inspired by a supposedly true event, but the man who lost his son to a mysterious tribe was Peruvian, not American, not to mention he was a lumberjack rather than an engineer. It took sixteen years for him to find his son, who had been totally assimilated into the primitive culture. Responding to these deviations, it was said that the screenplay was based on several real-life stories, not just this one.

The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in Brazil with additional studio stuff done in England.

Sadly, here is no different - Todd Armstrong in the title role and Nancy Novak as "" Medea"" are as wooden as the Argo in this retelling of the ancient Greek myth. It is still, however, an exciting action adventure though, with plenty of episodes to keep it moving along as Jason fights monsters and treachery to seek out the legendary Golden Fleece from the distant land of Colchis. It's got a decent enough, largely British, supporting cast with Honor Blackman standing out as his patron ""Hera"" and Nigel Green making for a wonderfully over-the-top ""Hercules"", but the spoils definitely go to Talos, the Harpies and the skeleton battle is fabulous.",7.0

Jason (Todd Armstrong), the rightful heir to the throne of Thessaly, Greece, gathers a crew of intrepid sailors to find the magical Golden Fleece, a quest that brings clashes with a 100’ bronze statue, a couple harpies, the venomous Hydra and a squad of sword-wielding skeletons.

“Jason and the Argonauts” (1963) is a sword & sandal flick based on Greek Mythology with Ray Harryhausen’s stop motion special effects, which were state-of-the-art at the time. It’s very similar to ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" from five years earlier and on par in all-around entertainment. 

You can’t beat the scenic Mediterranean locations, the vessel, the costumes and the mystical action sequences. The fight with the skeleton warriors only runs three minutes, at most, but it took Harryhausen four months to produce it.

Unfortunately, this isn’t as compelling, story-wise, as “Ulysses” (1954) and “Mysterious Island” (1961) or future flicks like “Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger” (1977) and “Conan the Barbarian” (1982). Those movies feature a fairly prominent female presence to counteract the sweaty men in loin cloths; this one doesn't. Sure, Nancy Kovack is on hand, but she doesn’t show up until well past the hour mark and not enough is done with her.

A recently divorced blonde bombshell in Reno (Marilyn Monroe) befriends three guys and stirs their passions: An aging cowboy (Clark Gable), a cynical bush pilot (Eli Wallach) and a brooding rodeo contender (Montgomery Clift). They take an excursion to capture wild mustangs for profit. Thelma Ritter is on hand as a fifth misfit in the first half.

“The Misfits” (1961) was Gable and Monroe’s final film and Clift’s last significant one. Gable passed away a few days after shooting from a heart attack while Marilyn died 18 months after its release. Clift was dead by 1966. Even Ritter died before the 60s were over.

It’s a B&W drama with Western elements and haunting reflections on the nature of life and death, reminiscent of those Tennessee Williams’ flicks of the era, like “The Night of the Iguana” and “The Fugitive Kind.” The characters are lost souls who drown out their pain with lots of drinking and shallow socializing. Monroe is voluptuous and charismatic; and there are thematic gems here and there, like Gay’s potent commentary on doing something with pure intentions while society pulls a bait-and-switch and it becomes morally dubious or outright bad. The film’s also a fascinating period piece.

FYI: Director John Huston originally wanted Robert Mitchum for Gable’s role, but by the time they worked the kinks out of the script Mitchum was busy with another project. The writer, Arthur Miller, was Marilyn’s husband during shooting, but they were officially divorced 11 days before its release.

He is ""Gay"", a tough but pretty past-it cowboy who is hanging out with his buddy ""Guido"" (Eli Wallach) leading a pretty aimless existence with a lifestyle that is gradually withering on the vine. That all changes when they encounter the flighty ""Roslyn"" (Marilyn Monroe) who has arrived in Reno to get a divorce. Briefly, a bit of a love triangle develops and despite them moving to a house that ""Guido"" was building for his late wife, she sets her hat at ""Gay"" instead, and a relationships starts to burgeon. Both men still have the wrangling spirit, and when a small herd of mustangs is spotted, they want to catch some (to sell on for dog food!), but for that they need another. Fortunately, en route to a rodeo they encounter the broke and stranded ""Perce"" (Montgomery Clift) and are soon chasing down the horses in the Nevada desert - much to the horror of ""Roslyn"". There are quite a few tussles in this well paced and creatively shot drama with all four characters having issues with the others that test their loyalties, integrity and spirit - as well as offering us just a soupçon of romance as the story concludes and choices have to be made. As ever, Thelma Ritter contributes well - though only at the start - as their broken-armed pal ""Isabelle"" but it's really just the quartet that gel effectively for this robust and characterful story and  who keep this entertaining for just over the two hours. I never really got why Monroe became such a star. Very attractive, yes, but not really much of an actress. Here, though, she ups her game a bit and is much better - more natural - than usual. There's quite a duel between man and horse at the end that's almost worth watching the whole film for too. Good stuff!",7.0
11542,"***“Night of the Apeman” mixed with some pretty heady material***

In the late 60s and mid-70s, a psychopathologist (William Hurt) from the New York/New England area honestly seeks ultimate truth and the origins of humanity through dubious experiments with sensory deprivation mixed with drugs, including a potent mixture used in ceremonies by Mexican AmerIndians. This leads to altered states of consciousness and amazing primordial revelations. Blair Brown is on hand as his romantic interest while Bob Balaban and Charles Haid appear as his colleagues, the latter a scientific version of a Pharisee.

Directed by Ken Russell, “Altered States” (198o) is a mature sci-fi drama with elements of mystery/horror. It comes across as a meshing of movies like “Wolfen” (1981), “An American Werewolf in London” (1981), Russell’s later “The Lair of the White Worm” (1988) and “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968). One of the fascinating things about the movie is that it shows how a person can reach other realms while in an isolated location through the power of the mind/spirit, albeit in this case with the assistance of drugs.

I can relate to a degree. For instance, eleven years ago I was sleeping in bed (during the day) having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. This happened again the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy?

Anyway, the apeman sequence is one of the best parts of the movie and recalls those werewolf flicks noted above (of course “Wolfen” isn’t really a werewolf picture). But “Altered States” is so much more than a standard creature feature or nature-runs-amok flick. The apeman make-up is great and the bizarre imaginings are similar to the same in “The Lair of the White Worm.” While I disagree with the evolutionary nonsense (humans didn’t evolve from apes, rolling my eyes), this is a fantasy about finding the truth by Ken Russell and so I don’t expect those kinds of details to be accurate anyway.

Blair is winsome in a girl-next-door kind of way and Russell doesn’t fail to capture her beauty (and I’m not tawkin about the top nudity), although that’s there too, if you’re interested.

I suggest using the subtitles since a lot of the jargon is pretty technical. It helps the viewer to stay with the story if you can understand what the characters are saying and discussing.

Sometimes it seems producers have a hard time understanding when a movie shouldn't be made. The “Police Academy” franchise should have ended in the sixth film, and even then it would be ending up pretty worn out. This film, made several years later, was an effort that was simply needless and certainly leaves no one with good memories.

After seeing the movie, I was really sorry that the franchise ended with such a bad movie. It was something that, for me, should have been avoided. “Police Academy” was one of the most interesting and successful comic franchises of the 80s, and there are still many people who have fond memories of these films today. I myself, as a child, saw them several times on television.

The script is perfectly idiotic and a simple excuse to take some of the characters in the film to post-Soviet Russia, where they must help the local police to fight a big mobster who is turning into an oligarch (one of many that, as we know, emerged from the ashes of the communist regime, fat with shady deals in which the Russian people ended up losing). It's an unhappy, poor script made by incapable people. Humor, on the other hand, is completely absent. I don't laugh for a single minute.

The cast, which until now had been relatively stable (with the absence of several actors starting from the fourth film), had completely collapsed, and most actors refused to be part of this project. George Gaynes is back, but his character, Commander Lassard, looks simply like an old man with Alzheimer's (with all due respect to anyone suffering from this serious illness, don't get me wrong). Gaynes is not funny, and his performance here is disgraceful. Michael Winslow also tries to make some of the jokes he's already used to us, taking advantage of his vocal skills... but he doesn't have the material or time and what he does has no freshness or novelty. Sir Christopher Lee makes a brief appearance in the film, and as far as I can understand, he did so as a favor to the producer. Friendship is a beautiful thing, and also professional courtesy, but I bet Lee won't want to be remembered for this movie (and he certainly won't, he's done better things, as we know). Who ends up standing out in some way is Ron Perlman. The actor, who we know for other, much more dignified works, tried to be funny and give some dignity to his character. Meritorious, respectable, but unworthy of the actor he is. The rest of the cast is not worth mentioning.

Are there any redeeming qualities in this film? To be honest, I don't think so..., but even so, I feel obliged to make a small caveat: I liked the fact that they did a lot of the filming in the real city of Moscow and that they used real Russian extras and Russian speakers. This gives the film a certain authenticity that deserves to be highlighted, and which is most lacking nowadays, where any piece of green or blue screen replaces a real set and saves a few dollars on the production budget. However, it must have taken courage and some dose of madness to try to make a film in the midst of the political and military upheavals Russia was experiencing in those years.",1.0

Boasting the solid Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in the leads, we are in very safe hands, and it may well say Matthew Robbins name on the directors chair, we are in no doubt that producer Stephen Spielberg has his stamp all over this one.

It had been years since I had last seen this film and my memory of it was very rusty so I thought I give it a new watch now to refresh my memory, and to see if my opinion of the film has changed.

Unfortunately I still don't like this film and I wasn't very impressed with it, to me it felt like it dragged on a bit and became boring, and I still hated the old woman. Like a typical old woman she has dementia (memory loss) but what's even more jarring is how does she know what the alien robots eat? I think the film could have done with more comedy because there hardly was much in the film, it's like it could have done with batteries included... Overall it's not a terrible film but it feels poor and it could have been done a lot better.",4.0

A book editor traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago by rail (Gene Wilder) supposedly witnesses a crime while partying with a secretary (Jill Clayburgh). He suddenly finds himself embroiled in a dangerous conspiracy. Richard Pryor plays a helpful thief, Ned Beatty a passenger, Patrick McGoohan a smooth art expert, Richard Kiel a heavy and Len Birman a cop.

""Silver Streak” (1976) meshes Hitchcockian murder thriller with the amusing antics of Wilder and Pryor for an entertaining train flick. As my title blurb states, it expertly mixes genres into a fun and compelling rail ride.  

If you like train flicks like ""Runaway Train"" (1985), ""Transiberian"" (2008), ""Train"" (2008), “Night Train” (2009), ""Beyond the Door III"" (1989), “The Cassandra Crossing” (1976), “Breakheart Pass” (1975) and “Horror Express” (1972) you’ll also enjoy this one. It’s as good or better than most of ’em. It just includes amusement along with the life-or-death thrills à la the 80’s Indiana Jones adventures.

The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in SoCal, including Century City (studio), Union Station in Los Angeles, South Pasadena (New Mexico train stop), the Mojave Desert (the ranch with the plane) and Brea (the redneck sheriff’s office), as well as Alberta (the prairie scenes), Locust Hill in Ontario, Union Station in Toronto and Northwestern Station in Chicago.

Class of 1984 is directed by Mark Lester and Lester co-writes the screenplay with Tom Holland and John Saxton. It stars Perry King, Roddy McDowall, Merrie Lynn Ross, Timothy Van Patten, Stefan Arngrim, Michael Fox, Roddy McDowall and Lisa Langlois. Music is by Lalo Schifrin and Alice Cooper and Cinematography by Albert J. Dunk.

New music teacher Andrew Norris (King) is shocked to find the pupils of Lincoln High rule the roost. Refusing to kowtow to Peter Stegman's (Patten) gang of thugs, he decides to fight back...

It's always tricky revisiting later in life films that have cemented themselves as cult favourites. Class of 1984 is one such cult favourite of many who eagerly digested it back in the early half of the 1980s, a time when censorship was rife and banning orders the order of the day. The word of mouth back then was that Lester's film pushed boundaries, a frightening vision of a future where education as we know it would be replaced by anarchy, the youths of the day running amok with violence, sexual aggression and copious amounts of drugs. was this an astute portent by Lester and his crew?...

Essentially this marks one of the turning points in the trashy filmic timeline of films dealing in educational establishments collapsing within via youth rebellion. Where the likes of Blackboard Jungle kicked things off with grim textures, Class of 1984 picks up the baton and urinates on it with a glint in its eye - for better or worse. As a whole the pic is given over to being ridiculous for the sake of shock value, yet it's strangely magnetic, managing to strike a nervous chord. Exploitation? No not really, that was just a marketing ploy that worked...

Viewing it these days it looks part of a tired formula, but that in no way should denigrate the importance of it, for it helped turn the tide in said formula. Ultimately it becomes a visceral revenge thriller, where some scenes are well constructed, others not so much, with the finale outrageously over the top. The acting from the younger cast members is mostly ok, though Patten is difficult to take serious as the gang leader. King is splendidly committed to the lead, garnering our support, while McDowall is the class act on show.

Hollywood has tanked, they really aren't putting out anything worth watching any longer... and it's debatable if Class of 1984 is really worth watching. I guess it depends on your mood.

But we need that padding back. We need a whole bunch of ridiculous, low budget exploitation films to pad and help finance the bigger ones. That might actually stop Hollywood from actively attacking the people that didn't go see the trash movies they spent millions on and still tanked.

Because, honestly, I'm not going to spend $25 a ticket to go see a gender and race swapped remake of a beloved childhood lecture with a heavy handed one sided political message and no real story or plot.

But I will spend a few bucks to stream a trash exploitation movie, with no real message, no real budget, and a plot that was made to just be fun and entertaining.

Class of 1984 is one of those movies, one of the movies where you can sit back and just be entertained for an hour without having to suffer through anything that you're not allowed to make fun of because... meh politics.

This is the type of movie where it's almost encouraged that you make fun of it... while you are watching it. This is the home movie market, where you don't view it in theaters because a little audience participation makes for a better viewing experience.

So, it seems like it want's to be a tribute to the Blues in that way... but it doesn't come across as the same comedic love letter to the music as the original one did.

And of course John is gone and even though this was Akroyd's love child, it just feels wrong having John Goodman--or anyone else--in his place.

But on the other hand it does have Koko instead of Franklin and I always liked her more. But it was the cameo of all cameos wasn't it?

Intrepid professor Sir Oliver S. Lindenbrook leads an expedition towards the center of the Earth via an extinct Icelandic volcano. The journey is sure to be fraught with danger and little do they know that their trip will take in many unchartered wonders...both good and bad!

As adventure films go, Journey To The Center Of The Earth has few peers, it's a wonderful film based around the Jules Verne story of the same name. There are no hidden agendas here, no wry social commentary or satirical edginess, it is pure fantastical entertainment that wants you to enjoy its science heart whilst you have a blast following this group into the wondrous unknown. Lost cities, prehistoric lizards, underground oceans, crystal caves, sand mines, murder, sabotage, and on it goes for just over two hours of delightful movie making, it even has time for a bit of cheeky sexual tom foolery for the knowing adult.

I'm sure the likes of Spielberg & Lucas were nodding in approval back in the day.

The sets, the sound, and the special effects were all nominated for Academy Awards, and sure enough all may well seem tame by todays bloated standards, but this is 1959 and let your mind be back to that time and you surely will be taken in by this joyous experience. While I must also mention that location footage shot in the beautiful Carlsbad Caverns that adds to the dynamic feel of the picture. Lead acting duties fall to the irrepressible James Mason as Lindenbrook, perfectly cast as he nails all the traits of this dyed in the wood professor. Support comes from Pat Boone, Arlene Dahl (the colour photography perfectly showing her piercing eyes), Peter Ronson and star of the show Gertrude The Duck.

In 1880, a professor from Edinburgh (James Mason) leads a team to follow a renowned scientist's path down an extinct volcano in Iceland to explore the bowels of the earth. Pat Boone plays the professor’s favorite student, Arlene Dahl the Swedish wife of the professor’s rival, Peter Ronson a towering Icelandic ranch hand and Thayer David the morally dubious descendent of the original pioneer.  

Very loosely based on Jules Verne’s book, “Journey to the Center of the Earth” (1959) is an amusing and imaginative family-friendly adventure flick with a superlative cast. It’s not great like “Mysterious Island” (1961) and is a little less serious, but it’s cut from the same cloth and is worth checking out if you can appreciate the quaintness of movies from that time period. Redhead Dahl is stunning, a true whoa-man. And Gertrude the duck is entertaining, but what happens to her is unforgivable.

It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World is one of those films that as a child I went to the cinema to watch and then proceeded to talk about it enthusiastically in the playground for weeks afterwards. So I find myself here in my middle age with mixed feelings after just revisiting this extravaganza for the first time in many a year.

It's very much a film of three parts to me, and each part impacts differently on the entertainment scale. The first part of this multi cast piece is as madcap and as mirthful as you could honestly wish to see, but this sadly ill prepares you for a middle part that outstays its welcome to the point that you can't believe they stretched it to an original cut of 3 hours! The final third of the film saves it from smug overkill because by now you have invested so much time into the film, you thank the gods for any sort of frivolity - and thankfully the film does lift you back up to the happy place that you had visited an hour previously.

The cast are fine, where some brilliant shows are mixed in with the merely acceptable ones, and I wouldn't want to be so churlish as to dissect each actors respective show. However, as a Phil Silvers fan I'm rewarded plenty enough and as a Spencer Tracy acolyte I'm burning candles again in his honour. Yet it's Ethel Merman as Mrs. Marcus that lives long and glorious in the memory here, and honestly I feel the film is worth a watch purely just for her.

Released in 1963, “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” is grand comedy-adventure about several motorists in the remote desert of Southern Cal learning of a buried cache of moolah in Santa Rosita State Park along the coast 200 miles south. A mad scramble to get to the money ensues. 

The cast is superlative with too many old-time greats to cite. The opening is compelling, the first act culminating with an amusing sequence where Jonathan Winters’ character levels a gas station in the desert. The wild close with the fire truck ladder and corresponding hospital gag is also superb entertainment. The middle of the film, while fun, can get tedious because emptyheaded shenanigans can only hold your interest for so long. In other words, the movie’s just too long for such madcap misadventures.

Nevertheless, it’s a fun, energetic flick with top-rate locations and this is the only way to see so many classic celebrities on screen together.

11576,"Maybe not since Michael Anderson managed to put together a stellar cast for his ""Around the World in Eighty Days"" (1956) have we seen quite such an ensemble group of famous faces peppering a light-comedy. This time, it all starts with Jimmy Durante being thrown from his crashing car and surviving just long enough to tell the gathered crowd of a $350,000 fortune buried under the ""Big W"". Initially the gang decide to work together to find and share the loot, but they can't agree on a formula to distribute it and so quickly it's every man (or dame) for themselves. How to get there? Well there are cars, trains and even an aeroplane put to good use as their ""Wacky Races"" style antics see friends and families fall out, fall in, row, squabble and use quit a bit of ingenuity to get to the Santa Rosita State Park first!. Meantime, disillusioned cop ""Culpeper"" (Spencer Tracy) is fed up with his measly pension provision, and it's likely to be his final act to try and locate some stolen cash. Yep.  The self same $350,000! He's no fool and as he learns of this group of treasure hunters, he decides to let them do the all of the heavy lifting then just pop up and wave his badge. Can it be that simple? Well, first of all these disparate folks have to find it - and as their journey gradually fills with acrimony and mistrust, you wouldn't want to bet on it. The star here for me is Terry-Thomas, a Brit who happens to be travelling in his car and who picks up the family from hell. They are led by fiery matriarch (Ethel Merman) and her drip of a son and pretty quickly their driver is in on their not-so-secret gig and devising some suitably mischievous plans of his own! Mickey Rooney's ""Ding Bell"" is also in on the chase; there's Phil Silvers rather over-acting as ""Otto"" and a slew of other familiar faces like Andy Devine, Zazu Pitts, Peter Falk - even Buster Keaton makes an appearance which is apt for the conclusion is straight out of one of his slapstick efforts from forty years earlier. At 3½ hours duration, it's too long. The action is fun for a while as they scramble for advantage but once we've met each of them and got to know their foibles the joke starts to wear a little bit thin and I found it really sagged, repetitively, for an hour in the middle. The occasionally pithy writing quickly gives way to a clunky screw-ball style that was as predictable as it was strained. The stereotypes of the plucky Englishman, the harridan mother-in-law, the ditzy gal - they all all work for a while but soon become a bit laboured and though it does liven up at the ending, I could probably have done with that about an hour earlier.

11577,"Ol' Pat... Sheriff Pat Garrett. Sold out to the Santa Fe ring. How does it feel?

Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is directed by Sam Peckinpah and written by Rudy Wurlitzer. It stars James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, Chill Wills and Barry Sullivan. Music is scored by Bob Dylan and cinematography by John Coquillon.

One time they were friends, cohorts in crime, but now Pat Garrett is the law and his objective is to bring down Billy the Kid.

It seems to be an absolute when writing about a Sam Peckinpah film that it was plagued by studio interference. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is no exception, the back story to which tells of behind the scenes clashes, bizarre cuts and a disownment of the film by cast and crew. Thankfully through the advent of time and technological advancements, it's one of the Peckinpah movies that can now be seen in a true light. A good job, too, since it's one of Bloody Sam's finest movies. My personal preference is for the TCM Preview version, and that is what is reviewed here.

Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid finds Peckinpah at his lyrical and elegiacal best, the old west is dying and as it is told through the eyes of aging Pat Garrett (Coburn), it's meticulously played out via an unhurried narrative structure. Time is afforded the key players, helping the story unfold its bitter take on the frontier changes as greed begets violence, Peckinpah wryly observing that the newly appeared good guys are no better than the bad guys, hence The Kid's (Kristofferson) reputation as a dandy likable outlaw becomes assured in spite of his less than honourable traits as a human being, but he at least is honourable to his codes.

Film contains many memorable scenes, scenes fit to grace any Western. A shoot-out and aftermath involving Pickens and Jurado has poignancy in abundance, Dylan's Knockin' On Heaven's Door tenderly filtered over the top of it. A duel featuring Jack Elam is another that resonates highly, great character moments are plentiful, performed by a roll call of Western movie legends, Peckinpah knew how to pick a cast and then some. Moments of violence are dotted throughout, Bloody Sam's trademark, as is cross-cuts, sepia tones and slow-mo. The great director even makes a Christ allegory not come off as cheap, and a self loathing mirror sequence strikes a significant chord.

This is a film big on characterisations, it's not just a film of visual touches, be it the dual psychological conflict between Pat and Billy, or the ream of peripheral players, everything they do is detailed and designed to capture the period and atmosphere of the changing times, the environment that folk inhabit, on either side of the law, is a big issue. No frame is wasted, MGM and their head honcho James Aubrey in their ignorance failed to see this fact. While the cast turn in damn fine work and Coquillon's burnished photography is striking and perfect for the director's vision.

It's undeniably downbeat, and the slow pace isn't to everyone's liking, but this is up with the other Peckinpah Western greats, The Wild Bunch and Ride the High Country. A truly great Western crafted by a truly great director. 9/10",9.0
11577,"_**Peckinpah’s lyrical (dull) Western with a great cast and Dylan’s music**_

In 1881 New Mexico, Pat Garrett (James Coburn) is now a lawman working for ranch barons who want Garrett to take out his former wild friend, Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson). Everything leads to the final showdown at Fort Sumner. Bob Dylan is on hand as a stranger who assists Billy while notable actors show up for bit parts, usually just to get shot to death (R.G. Armstrong, Matt Clark, L.Q. Jones, Slim Pickens, Jack Elam, Katy Jurado, Chill Wills, Jason Robards, Richard Jaeckel, etc.).

“Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid” (1973) was a project that director Sam Peckinpah wanted to fulfill a dozen years earlier with his script for what he called “the definitive Billy the Kid movie” based on Charles Neider’s 1956 novel “The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones,” a fictional treatment of the story, with Stanley Kubrick set to direct. Marlon Brando eventually took over that production to create his outstanding “One-Eyed Jacks” (1961) with Peckinpah not given any writing credit.

In any case, this was a troubled production with the turbulent director struggling with serious alcoholism and only coherent for about four hours a day. Kristofferson got Dylan involved, who was initially enlisted to compose the title song, but eventually wrote the score/soundtrack for the entire film, most notably ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door.” The soundtrack album was released seven weeks after the movie’s debut.

It’s very similar in tone and theme to Peckinpah’s “The Wild Bunch” (1969) with Coburn’s role being almost identical to that of Robert Ryan in that more famous Western. It’s also reminiscent of contemporaneous films like “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” and “The Missouri Breaks.” But it’s the least of these because the story is both uninvolving and tedious despite the gory gun slayings every 10 minutes. Like “The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid” from the year prior, it makes the Old West ugly. 

Meanwhile Dylan’s one-dimensional folk ditties don’t help in making it compelling, but rather drag it down. I mean no disrespect to the musical icon. His music is fine for what it is; it’s just too static to carry a film like this IMHO.

Peckinpah complained that 15 minutes were cut from his preview version while six editors are credited with the final product. Maybe this is why there’s no drive to the picture. Too many cooks spoil the broth.      

On a positive note, Dylan does fine in his acting debut and looks more like the real-life Billy the Kid than Kristofferson, who resembles Jim Morrison. Plus there are some great sequences, like Billy’s 10-step duel with Elam’s character. And you can’t beat the cast, which also includes Rita Coolidge, who was Kristofferson’s girlfriend during shooting and would become his wife for the next seven years.

To see Peckinpah at his Western best I recommend the outstanding “Ride the High Country” (1962) and the unique “The Ballad of Cable Hogue” (1970).

There are a few cuts of the film: The theatrical version runs 1 hr 46 min, the 1988 restored cut runs 2 hr 2 min and the 2005 Special Edition runs 1 hr 55 min (which is the version I saw). The movie was shot in Durango Mexico, roughly 500 miles due south of the historical locations in New Mexico.

11577,"James Coburn has something of the Angel of Death to him in this rather pace-less but still quite enthralling story of these two men after they'd ceased being on the same side. His alter-ego here (Kris Kristofferson) is having some fun in New Mexico to the chagrin of some cattle ranchers and so they employ ""Garrett"" to come be their sheriff and settle things down. He warns his erstwhile buddy to skedaddle, but of course he doesn't and so a posse is formed to chase him out or track him down. With both men determined in their own way to never give in, a lethal denouement begins to look like it will be the only way to prove who's best. Coburn only ever really had one, very slow, gear - but his considered effort here actually starts to imbue his character with quite a bit of menace and counters engagingly with the more profligate, almost playboy, image offered of ""Billy"" by Kristofferson. There is plenty of action as the story sees the lawman hoover up some of the more undesirable elements of the now less ""wild"" west and that, in itself, is quite symbolic of changing attitudes amongst a more civilised and law-abiding community. Of course, it would not be complete without some early symbolism of corporate greed, and it soon becomes evident that the barons paying his wages have an agenda of their own. There's a solid supporting cast with veteran western stars Chill Wills, Jason Robards, Barry Sullivan (he's doing John Wayne's bit) and the always curmudgeonly Jack Elam keeping the thing characterful and authentic looking and then there's Bob Dylan. Why? Your guess is as good as mine as he brings very, very, little to his largely dialogue-free part. Indeed, were it not for frequent reprises of a his song - ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" proving quite appropriate, his presence would be completely superfluous to a gritty and thoughtful story that points to the end of an era.",7.0

Written/directed by Michael Crichton and released in 1978/79, “The Great Train Robbery” was loosely based on the real-life Great Gold Robbery of 1855 that took place in England. Sean Connery plays the mastermind, Lesley-Anne Down his girlfriend and Donald Sutherland a safecracker with whom they team-up.

I generally don’t like caper films because the protagonists are criminals, but Crichton wisely makes the characters played by Connery and Sutherland likable rapscallions; meanwhile Down is babelicious, in particular in her jaw-dropping first scene. Crichton intentionally made the movie more farcical compared to his novel and I appreciated the wit and low-key humor. I didn’t expect to like this movie, but it won me over.

Though I have not seen the two more recent 'prequels' for the 'Exorcist' franchise, I can safely say that while 'Exorcist II' is not the worst horror movie ever made (that, by the way, never seemed its intention), it's certainly the worst of the original trilogy--and by a country mile. This is a work that would probably bore the demons so much, they would decide to get out of Regan MacNeil's body, and perhaps even leave Earth's plane altogether, never even wanting a return ticket.",5.0
11586,"One of the many things that make The Exorcist arguably the greatest horror films ever made – or simply one of the greatest films ever made, regardless of genre –, is that it has no use for the obligatory final shot suggesting that the evil will continue. On the contrary, it ends on a hopeful, optimistic note; a welcome relief following the ordeal we, characters and viewers alike, have just endured.

Exorcist II: The Heretic carries on as if that final shot had actually been there all along. It's not just that Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) must go back to dealing with Pazuzu four years after the fact – meaning that two good men died for nothing –; it's how this reencounter comes about.

Once we accept the possibility of demonic possession, everything else in The Exorcist is perfectly plausible. The Heretic, on the other hand, comes up with a ""synchronized hypnosis"" device that leads to such ludicrous dialogue as ""Your machine has proved that there's an ancient demon within her!""

That this line is delivered by a frantic Richard Burton – who could achieve greatness with the right material – doesn't do it any favors. All things considered, the only heresy on display here is what director John Boorman does to the source material (in fairness to writer William Goodhart, his script was apparently rewritten beyond recognition) – I did, however, really enjoy the metaphorical use of locusts, which can go from solitary and harmless grasshoppers to, well, Legion.",2.0
11587,"Very good sequel retains the high standard Blatty's original screenplay set!

In going through the original 'Exorcist' trilogy (I have the DVD 6-pack, with the two versions of the remarkable original, as well as the two recent prequels, so far unwatched), I was intrigued of seeing Oscar-winning writer William Peter Blatty's second stint behind the camera (for the record, I adored his 'The Ninth Configuration', done a decade prior), especially for the franchise that became his bread-and-butter (though I loved two films he earlier had co-wrote: 'A Shot in the Dark' and 'The Omega Man').

He once again does quite a credible job--both with the writing and in helming the picture. To me, it didn't matter much that Linda Blair wasn't involved--I like how it became a search for an already-dead serial killer--and I have been a great fan of George C. Scott in genre films since the likes of 'Dr. Strangelove' and 'The Changeling'. The scares and shocks were genuine, and the suspense and interest were there. It made me wish that even more sequels had been made, it was THAT good.",8.0
11587,"What's good in this film we can attribute to William Peter Blatty's script and direction and to the casting, especially Brad Dourif and George C. Scott; what's bad, to Executive Meddling – in particular the last minute exorcism performed by a last minute priest; it says a lot that Burton's Father Lamont from Exorcist II: The Heretic is more memorable than Nicol Williamson's Father Morning.

Unlike The Heretic, III looks and feels – except for a bizarre dream sequence featuring cameos by Fabio and Patrick Ewing as angels – like it belongs in the same world as The Exorcist; that is to say, it knows the words and the music.

There are haunting visuals that stay with you long after the film is over (the crucifix opening its eyes, the old woman crawling on the ceiling, Scott's daughter's near decapitation). At the same time, the film has a sense of humor that I would call shakespearean; Father Joseph Dyer (Ed Flanders), whose dialogue includes a reference to Mel Brooks's Spaceballs, is akin to the gravedigger in Hamlet or the porter in Macbeth.

What bothers me about III is the same that troubles me about The Heretic – though to a much lesser degree –, and it's the 'how.' Specifically, how Patient X, alias Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), ends up in a cell in a hospital's psychiatric ward for the past 15 years.

It's a good thing that Blatty decided to have X played by both Miller and Dourif – more so the latter than the former –, because Dourif, as James 'The Gemini Killer' Venamun, has a long, expository, loose-end-tying monologue which proves that sometimes you can indeed polish a turd; it doesn't, even after allowing for supernatural intervention, make a lick of sense (the corpse of a beloved local priest bursts out of his ""cheap little coffin"" and goes missing, and no one is the wiser? Yeah, right), but it's all in the delivery.

Dourif turns in a blood-curdling, bone-chilling campfire tale (at one point he even briefly reflects ""is this true?"", as if he finds it hard to swallow himself). Now, I'm not saying Miller couldn't have done this, but in retrospect I don't see how he or anyone else could have; I only know Dourif did it because I watched him do it in a movie-stealing performance that doubled the considerable respect I already had for him and his craft.",6.0

Brian G. Hutton followed the considerable success he had had with 1968's Where Eagles Dare, with this, another men on a mission movie - only this one is very much a different animal. Hutton directs and Troy Kennedy-Martin writes the screenplay, it stars Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland and Don Rickles. Music is by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography is by Gabriel Figueroa.

When it comes to light that there is a considerable stash of Nazi gold waiting to be plundered behind enemy lines in occupied France, a group of maverick U.S. soldiers set off on a deadly mission to locate and gain...

Woof Woof!

Utterly wonderful. Kelly's Heroes mixes together war movie action staples with black comedy gold, the greed and insanity of war having its cheek poked by a sharp and bloody tongue. The script is clever, often very funny, often poignant and poised, and it's this that lets a great cast have a ball. You have the straight laced delivery of Eastwood playing against Savalas' macho rage, and Rickles' jumping- bean turn jostling with Sutherland's pre-hippy malarkey. Character names range from the likes of Oddball, Crapgame, Big Joe, Little Joe and Cowboy, a rogue group of soldiers deciding they want to grab something for themselves.

Up yours, baby!

The journey to find the gold is of course far from straight forward, with Hutton constructing some white hot action scenes. And it's here where it often gets forgotten that Kelly's Heroes does not forget the blood shed during war. People do die, it's not all fun and frolics, and Hutton knows his way around great suspense passages. Witness the brilliant minefield sequence and the ticking clock finale where we are never sure if any of the men will achieve their goal. So laugh while you ponder, then? Absolutely. Kelly's Heroes is caper and chaos, beef and brawn, but always cunning and crafty as well. 9/10",9.0
11589,"**_Amusing all-star WW2 dramedy/action flick with Eastwood and Savalas_**

Clint Eastwood stars as the title character who convinces Sgt. Big Joe (Telly Savalas), his platoon, and a free-spirited Sherman tank commander (Donald Sutherland) to spend their three-day leave on a gold heist at a French village 30 miles behind enemy lines. The events take place 12 weeks after the Normandy invasion.

""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970) was obviously inspired by ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" from four years earlier. Carroll O'Connor even plays the same basic role, a general who mistakes the misdeeds of Allied soldiers as brave, selfless combat; and arrives on the scene to commend them.

The picture uncannily combines zany comedy with serious war action and is highlighted by the fun, eccentric theme song ""Burning Bridges"" by The Mike Curb Congregation. Of course the all-star cast is great with Sutherland standing out as Oddball. People complain that Oddball was anachronistic since he was a late-60's hippie type, but his crew resembled Gypsies and, besides, there are laid-back free-spirited types in every generation.

While the film is overall superior to ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" it's inferior in that it lacks a female cast member in the form of the jaw-dropping Giovanna Ralli. Actually, the flick was slated to have a female role, but it was cut from the script prior to shooting. The stunning Ingrid Pitt was cast, as she worked with Eastwood two years earlier in ""Where Eagles Dare."" Ingrid was virtually climbing on board the plane bound for the set in Yugoslavia when word came that her part was cut. The fools.

The film is a little overlong at 2 hours, 24 minutes, and perhaps should've been cut by about 15-20 minutes, but the compelling last hour makes up for any flabbiness. The movie was shot in the Istrian village of Vizinada in Croatia (street scenes); Obrenovac, Serbia (Bridge over the Kolubara River); Beocin, Serbia (scenes with the general); and the coast of Slovenia (south of Trieste, Italy).

11589,"I think this is probably my favourite outing for Telly Savalas on the big screen as he decides to join his eponymous lieutenant (Clint Eastwood) on a perilous journey across enemy lines. With shells going off everywhere, their platoon captures a Nazi officer who reveals that there is a bank in rural France that is home to gold - $16 millions worth of gold. How can they get it, though? Well that's where the inventive ""Kelly"" drafts in the help of quartermaster-cum-scrounger ""Crapgame"" (Don Rickles); the aptly named and eccentric tank commander ""Oddball"" (Donald Sutherland) and leaving the captain's yacht to the mercies of the bombs, this disparate bunch start their journey. It proves surprisingly straightforward to make progress - a progress that causes some chagrin for ""Gen. Colt"" (Carroll O'Connor) who thinks that they are a collection of courageous soldiers worthy of medals galore - and of whom he is soon in hot pursuit without a clue as to their less than patriotic intent. Upon arrival at the town, the heroes discover there are well-armed Tiger tanks there, and the building that is supposed to hold the gold is well defended. How to destroy the tanks, get the gold and not reduce the entire village to rubble is now the order of the day... Eastwood holds this adventure together well, but it's really an ensemble effort with the entertaining Sutherland and Savalas working well with Troy Kennedy Martin's lively characterisations and script. Director Brian Hutton also keeps the pace moving well with plenty of action, the odd tin of (pink) paint and an exciting stand off at the denouement. Can they get away with it?

Paul Newman is the coach of third rate failing minor league hockey team, The Charlestown Chiefs. The town is hit hard by unemployment and this appears to be the Chiefs' last season, however, if the coach can whip up the team up into a winning frenzy, then the unknown owner might just find a buyer and save all their carers? The management bring in three odd looking brothers who, once unleashed, take the whole team on a blood thirsty winning streak right to the championship final. The crowds flock in thirsting for more blood, but then the problems start to arise.

Slap Shot is a tremendously funny film, it's also incredibly violent and often vulgar in dialogue, but be sure to know that both things go hand in hand here (or should it be glove in glove?) to create one of the smartest sports pictures in the modern age. The hockey sequences are excellent (especially to a non fan like me), and the script bristles with course and biting humour. Slap Shot on its initial release was frowned upon by many critics, it was considered too profane and overly harsh with the win at all costs theme driving it forward. However, it's now rightly embraced as the smart and intelligent piece that director George Roy Hill wanted it to be seen as. A new generation of movie fans have started to seek it out and its reputation and fan base grows ever more larger by the year.

Newman was a bona fide star, his hair silver grey but his good looks still firmly intact, his performance has a grace about it that oddly sits nicely amongst this cynical stab at professional hockey; even if his characters' clothes are, in truth, icky. It would be a big disservice if I didn't mention the impact of the Hanson Brothers, surely one of the finest combinations to have ever graced a sports movie? They are at once unassumingly likable, the next gleefully violent, they are the glue that binds the whole picture together. Film is filled out with sparkling support work from the likes of Strother Martin, Michael Ontkean, Jennifer Warren, Lindsay Crouse and Jerry Houser.

Not long after originally writing this review, the legend that was Paul Newman sadly passed away, he left behind a movie legacy that few can touch, and trust me, this is one of them. A sports movie that never gets old and continues to pay off on repeat viewings. 8.5/10",8.0

A brain surgeon and widower in Los Angeles (Steve Martin) unknowingly marries a malevolent gold-digger (Kathleen Turner), but stumbles upon a living female brain in Vienna in which he has an affinity (voiced by Sissy Spacek). David Warner is on hand as a mad doctor in Austria.

“The Man with Two Brains” (1983) is similar in style & humor to “The Jerk” (1979), obviously because it’s by the same director/actor team. It’s a nutty send-up of mad doctor flicks and is quietly amusing, but rarely laugh-out-loud funny.

The film scores pretty well on the feminine front showcasing voluptuous Turner in all her glory, tastefully. Randi Brooks is also on hand as Fran, but her voice is really annoying, lol (the voice of Fran, that is). There’s a little top nudity, but the film somehow eludes the rut of raunch.

I also appreciated the message at the end concerning the uncanny connection of soulmates that is so profound the physical no longer matters (much).

The nicest neighbours can have the darkest secrets of all and the most hospitable and unassuming people can also be the most abominable monsters. Beverly Sutphin is a case in point. She is a charming and delightful house wife, mother, and ruthless serial killer in John Waters's controversial and outrageous satirical black comedy which affords him the ideal opportunity to present a range of biting and astutely observed insights into contemporary America and the ceaseless media frenzy surrounding the absolutely ridiculous and completely irresponsible cult of celebrity.",8.0

But the second half of the book dragged for me. Not so with the movie. They didn’t take their ending to the same place, and I can’t fault that choice.

Paul Newman is effortlessly great in this, and he has a superb supporting cast. Jessica Tandy, Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis head up the ensemble cast.

Parodying much of 70s TV shows and movies, there are skits like the naughty Catholic High School Girls in Trouble promo reel, a blaxploitation parody, and the gem of the movie which is a kung-fu parody which takes up a good bit of the movie's running time.

Like any comedy skit anthology the skits are uneven. Some are winners, some are flops. In retrospect they are perhaps more interesting in looking back on the 70s in a parody format. But the kung-fu parody is truly on target in what it parodies and the centerpiece of the movie. Alone I would give the kung-fu parody an 8/10 rating.

Stir of Echoes is written and directed by David Koepp who adapts from the novel of the same name written by Richard Matheson. It stars Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Zachary David Cope, Illena Douglas, Jennifer Morrison, Kevin Dunn and Conor O'Farrell. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Fred Murphy.

Chicago phone engineer Tom Witzky (Bacon) submits to being hypnotised by his sister-in-law and finds that his young son's imaginary friend is not imagined after all...

Undeniably lost in the slip-stream of the similar themed ""The Sixth Sense"", Stir of Echoes screams out to be seen by more fans of supernatural mysteries. It's a near faultless production, with Koepp getting all the key ingredients right on both the page and in transfer to the screen. Pacing is often the problem with films of a similar ilk, but Koepp deftly structures it in three engrossing sections.

First third establishes the main characters and the supernatural set-up, but the bonus here is that character reactions are believable, especially with Erbe's confused wife. Koepp has a great sense of atmosphere whilst ensuring we are fully immersed in Tom Wizky's new world of disorientation by way of terrifying visions and red light shocks. Second third brings the chills and the odd boo-jump, again the director is aware that too many jumps can overkill the plot, so they are nicely spaced out and accompanied by a palpable fear of the unknown. Then the last third unravels in a whirl of Roy Neary like obsessions and ghosts of the past denouements. It's a standard formula, yet it's amazing just how often film makers get it wrong, especially in horror. Not a problem here. 

Film is further boosted by Newton Howard's score that blends the ethereal with rising thunder and Murphy's colour photography, the latter of which helps to paint a harmonious Chicago neighbourhood, soon to be turned upside down, literally at one end of the street. The acting is super, which in Bacon's case is a given to anyone who has followed his career, and Koepp shows some nice and creepy visual filming techniques to further enhance the great Richard Matheson's story. There's the odd little misstep, such as a thread involving a secret organisation that has the ""gift"" of being ""open"" to the supernatural, that feels like filler to over state Tom's torment. While the post reaction to a suicide attempt isn't given nearly enough screen time to really add impetus to the unfolding mystery.

11617,"In this old classic John Wayne had not yet become the somewhat grumpy old tough guy as he is in many of his classical movies. He is somewhat younger and his character as Lt. Col. Kirby Yorke is a bit more emotional than the characters that he often played and there is a bit more romance in this movie as well. At least in my experience with John Wayne’s movies.

I was not sure if I was going to like this movie so much since it is generally put in the Romance genre as well as the Western genre. However I can without a doubt say that I did indeed like it quite a lot. It is still a good old-fashioned Western movie with brawls, fistfights and a lot of shooting. John Wayne is great in his role and a lot of the supporting characters are very enjoyable. I especially liked the old Sgt. Major and I would have liked there to be a more official scene of forgiveness between Mrs. Yorke and him. There were a lot of nice interaction between the Sgt. Major as well as between other characters in the movie. At times the movie was really funny due to these interactions between several of the rather original characters in the movie.

To my understanding John Ford was more or less forced by Republic Pictures into making this movie in exchange for his pet project, The Quiet Man, to be produced. I would say that this was a good move by the movie company even though the movie was produced as a low-budget movie even by the standards at the time.

The only thing I feel sorry about is that it was shot in black & white. As is often the case in good old Western movies there are a fair share of lovely nature scenery and I think some of that would have been much better in full color.

This offering throws up a number of emotions by splicing Western staple conventions. We have a special war time romance (the excellent John Wayne & Maureen O'Hara), a fair dash of humour (hats off to Ben Johnson), and some delightful tunes brought to us by Sons Of The Pioneers. But ultimately it's the realistic feel to the film that makes it so special. There is no overkill of the subjects, it is painted as hard grind, not all whooping in the air and shooting the enemy - with the camera work from Ford able to bring it all vividly to life. What we ultimately get is a post civil war tale that looks great and beats a sound and true heart. 8/10

Despite the crazy premise, the script actually works—it’s lighthearted, funny, and has just the right amount of emotional depth to keep you invested.

It’s definitely one of those feel-good films you can watch again and again. Sure, it’s a bit out there, but that’s part of its charm. If you’re looking for something heartwarming and entertaining, this movie hits all the right notes.",9.0
11623,"_**Beware the ‘deathlook’ of Richard Burton**_  

A writer in London is convinced he has the power to cause destruction at will (Richard Burton) and it’s driving him mad. Lee Remick plays his psychiatrist while Lino Ventura is on hand as a Scotland Yard detective.

""The Medusa Touch"" (1978) is a slow burn psychological thriller/horror that takes the psychokinesis element of “Carrie” but throws in the mass disaster angle of the later “The Mothman Prophecies” (2002). Other films covering this kind of mind power include ""Powder"" (1995), ""Phenomenon"" (1996) and “Youth Without Youth” (2007) with the difference here being that the protagonist’s party trick is mayhem rather than benevolence. 

Like the original Star Trek pilot, “Where No Man Has Gone Before” (1966), the theme is power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. For instance, if Morlar (Burton) wanted to illustrate his power to the therapist, why not simply lift up her dress or something else harmless, such as picking up a chair? Like Bruce Banner, his gift (or curse) only manifests when provoked to anger.

Remick was the youngest adult cast member at 42 during shooting. I’m not an ageist, but the rest of the cast is glaringly mature. Burton was only 52, but looks way older (he must’ve lived a hard life). Nevertheless, he’s legendary and you can’t beat his presence, voice or delivery.  

The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in London and the greater London area, including the White Cliffs of Dover and Reculver Towers, which are about an hour’s drive east of the city on the coast.

His recollections to his psychiatrist ""Dr. Zonfeld"" (Lee Remick) are relayed to police inspector ""Brunel"" (Lino Ventura) after he (""Morlar"") is found savagely beaten at his London flat. As the investigation expands, it is clear that the normal rules do not apply here. ""Morlar"" shouldn't even be alive, yet his brain activity coupled with a spate of accidents and with the ever more revealing - but sensational - revelations about his disaster-prone past lead ""Brunel"" and the Assistant Commissioner (Harry Andrews) to a conclusion that, well, they just cannot believe. Ventura is good in this, as is the understated, but effective Remick. There are plenty of twists that keep the obvious from becoming too obvious, too soon, and when called upon, Burton contributes well in a sort of manic, epitome of evil, manner.

11631,"***SPOILERS AHEAD***

_Mamma Mia!_ is an American-British romantic comedy musical directed by Phyllida Lloyd. The movie is loosely based on the original London musical also directed by Lloyd, and was the brain child of Judy Craymer who was convinced ABBA songs could be used in a theatrical production, especially after hearing the love ballad _The Winner Takes It All_. Craymer along with British playwright Catherine Johnson also worked on this film. Johnson being the original musical's scriptwriter wrote the movie's script, Craymer was an executive producer alongside Gary Goetzman as well as Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson.

The film stars Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper, Amanda Seyfried, and Christine Baranski.

Set on the idyllic Greek island of Kalokairi it tells the story of Donna Sheridan (Streep) an independent manageress and owner of her own hotel. Donna has a 20 year-old daughter by the name of Sophie (Seyfried) who is getting married to Sky (Cooper). Upon finding Donna's old diary Sophie discovers that there were three men: Sam Carmichael (Brosnan), Harry Bright (Firth) and Bill Anderson (Skarsgård) and learns that one of them could be her father. She decides to invite all three of them to her wedding. 

Sophie later reveals this to her friends Ali (Rachel MacDowall) and Lisa (Ashley Lilley) who have agreed to be her bridesmaids. Donna has invited her old friends/bandmates Rosie (Walters) and Tanya (Baranski) to the wedding to help her out. She is however completely unaware of what Sophie has done and is taken by surprise when Sam, Harry and Bill arrive on the island. This causes Donna to have a mid-life crisis, and it is up to Rosie and Tanya to lift her spirits. While at the same time Sophie bonds with the three men, and discovers she has a trait from each of them. Things get complicated when all three men agree to give Sophie away, and realizing the mess she created she faints at her own bachelorette party.

The next day Sophie runs into Donna who is convinced that she wants the wedding called off. This causes Sophie to yell at Donna, and openly states she wants to avoid all the mistakes Donna has made in her life. At the same time Donna is pursued by Sam, the two realize they still love each other but are too busy for each other. Meanwhile, Tanya is courted by Sky's friend and best man Pepper (Philip Michael) despite the fact that he is old enough to be her son. Sophie then runs to Sky and admits what she did, angry and hurt Sky runs off. At the same time Sam tells Sophie that marriage is not always a happy thing.

Sophie then runs back to her mother and asks her to help her dress for the wedding, Donna is delighted and they mend their relationship. Sophie then learns that Donna was disowned by her mother when she got pregnant, she then proceeds to ask Donna to give her away. Donna happily agrees and as the two prepare to go to the chapel she finds herself accosted by Sam. Sam demands to know why Donna will not explain why she won't talk about their relationship. Donna then says she still loves him despite her better judgement and the fact that he broke her heart by being engaged.

Donna then proceeds to run into the chapel where the wedding finally begins. As the ceremony begins Donna realizes that she can't hide the fact that the men are there. She then introduces Sophie's dad, but then learns that Sophie invited all three of them. They then all decide to be a third of her father, Sophie surprised decides to call off the wedding. Prompting Sky to run away with her and sail the world. Sam meanwhile decides that the wedding should not go to waste, despite Donna's protest at bigamy. After revealing his divorce Sam pops the question, hesitant Donna accepts it. At the wedding reception Rosie falls in love with Bill, who at first rejects her advances but then ends up loving her too.

The movie closes with Donna and Sam alongside Bill and Harry bidding Sophie and Sky farewell as they sail away from Kalokairi. Donna, Tanya and Rosie then reprise _Dancing Queen_ during the end credits, and then the rest of the cast appears and they all sing the song _Waterloo_. The movie then finally ends with Sophie singing _Thank You For the Music_ during the end credits.

Told using several popular ABBA songs including_ Honey, Honey, Honey_, _Dancing Queen_ and the iconic titular song _Mamma Mia_ this movie soundtrack is responsible for making ABBA's music hit the charts again. Albeit some bad singing (cough)Pierce Brosnan(cough) the soundtrack is wonderful. The movie has some references to other films including _Dirty Dancing_ and _Grease._ Meryl Streep's performance of Donna Sheridan is an amazing example of her versatility especially when she sings the love ballad ""The Winner Takes It All."" ""S.O.S"" is an interesting scene Brosnan's voice is flat but judging by his body language he is enjoying himself.

If you ignore the bad singing, you will be able to enjoy this film. I highly recommend it and the soundtrack. However, due to royalties and disagreements with UNICEF UMG and Decca Records could not secure the rights to the song _Chiquitita_ which explains why it is not on the CD.

If you have not seen this movie, then what are you waiting for?! Stream it or buy it and do it before July 20 because that is when it's highly anticipated sequel hits theaters!

11631,"**With a good cast and an enviable and appealing soundtrack, the film promised to be excellent… but it turned out to be much more average than I imagined.**

First of all, I think I need to make a note: I can't say that I'm an ABBA fan, but the truth is that I have a great affection for the band and their songs, because they were songs that I remember hearing on TV when I was a kid. It is a childhood memory, which has a sentimental charge, and which cannot be evaluated in a completely neutral way (childhood memories never leave us neutral).

I have yet to say that I had high expectations for the film. I'm not just talking about the music and the various songs I remember listening to, but also the enormous quality of the cast selected for the project, and the active participation of elements of the former band in the production. It was something that promised to have great quality. Well, the film has its qualities, it's undeniable, but the truth is that I noticed some laziness and sloppiness in the production, in several aspects.

The film's biggest problem was the absence of a well-written script that could support the action and songs. In addition to the slew of summer movie clichés, the script copied an old Italian movie called _Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell_, whose action is based on the dubious parenting of the protagonist's daughter, played by Gina Lollobrigida. I cannot say that we are in a situation of plagiarism because there are many films about children that do not know their parents, but the lack of originality is remarkable. Also, the film seems to almost make the apology of sexual promiscuity! In the midst of an uncomplicated, light, “hippie” environment, the film puts the main character’s mother in an embarrassing situation: she is the single mother of a daughter who grew up not knowing her father because there are three possible “candidates”, with whom she got involved almost simultaneously! And I'd rather not talk about that scene where a mature woman flirts with a guy much younger than her!

Jumping from Broadway to Hollywood, Phyllida Lloyd assured a sincere, but not excellent, effort at the direction. She was not able to demand more from her crew, she allowed a very poor conception of the characters and the choice of actors was not at all happy from the moment they had to sing. The best choices were Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep, two solid, charismatic, expressive actresses with an excellent voice. The scenes in which the two are protagonists, speaking or singing, are among the best in the film, which was an excellent bet that Seyfried made in her career. Stellan Skarsgard did reasonably well, but I felt he had little to do, and so Colin Firth... in fact, this English actor, whose voice is not particularly pleasant, already seemed to me to be a dubious choice for a musical. However, he looked like an opera diva when compared to Pierce Brosnan or Julie Walters. The ex-Bond has great difficulty with the treble and sings almost in falsetto, and Walters can't sing without starting to scream.

Technically, the film isn't brilliant either. On the positive side, we have the elegant cinematography, with the sun, the sea and the scenic beauty of the Greek islands favoring the visuals (we have to agree that the filming locations were wonderfully used), as well as the well-conceived sets and costumes. But the film's strong point is the soundtrack, of course, with an abundant list of ABBA songs, so famous that we can sing the entire movie. However, the insertion of each song in the film leaves a lot to be desired, something that, along with somewhat artificial choreography, leaves us with the feeling that the film is almost a gigantic music video clip, with the script being just an excuse for the songs to appear successively.",5.0

Sure, it's not a wonderful piece of classic cinema; but it must bring a smile to your face (even if - as Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård or Colin Firth break into song, it's more of a grimace). Dominic Cooper makes a valiant effort as ""Sky"" who is to wed the orchestrator of this whole predicament ""Sophie"" (Amanda Seyfried) who has invited the three men to her wedding in the hope that she might find out which of them might be her father.

As older movies can still hold up even though they have the same overarching story as the movies in the genre that succeed them. This one, I didn’t feel like had any real differences except it was done with puppets. The fact that you have puppets in a movie should not be the selling point.

11644,"Superior entry on De Palma's CV.

Brian De Palma has always gotten a bad rap for his penchant for essaying his heroes and favourite thrillers, what often gets forgotten is just how great he could be in crafting said thrillers.

Blow Out has John Travolta as a sound engineer for low budget horror movies, who while out recording sounds one night witnesses a car crash and dives into the river to rescue the call girl trapped in the back seat (Nancy Allen). Upon listening back to the footage of the crash, he hears two noises which point to a gun shot being fired at the car. So with the dead man in the car turning out to be a big political mover, he quickly finds himself spun into a web of intrigue, peril, paranoia and conspiracies. Can he and the girl stay alive long enough to solve the case?

Blow Out finds De Palma at the top of his game, blending the twisty plot dynamics with virtuoso technical smarts. A number of scenes are striking, both visually and in execution and the garnering of acting performances. Pino Donaggio provides an unforgettable music score to marry up to the layers of sub-plots folding together, and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond sharpens the primary colours (pic is awash with lurid pinks and purples - true neo-noir style) to give the story a Giallo like sheen that runs concurrent with the emotional states of the major players.

A sprawling and bustling Philadelphia plays host to a conspiracy sandwich, with a corking side order of the film making process. Sometimes bleak and complex (how great it is to find a true noir finale), but never over stuffed, Blow Out is both thrilling and smart, while Travolta has never been better and John Lithgow is tailor made as the unstoppable crack-pot unleashed into our two protagonists' world. 9/10",8.5
11644,"_**Colorful De Palma crime mystery with Travolta and Lithgow**_

A sound effects man in Philadelphia (John Travolta) obtains evidence that a fatal accident involving the governor wasn’t really an accident, which thrusts him into danger with shady characters. John Lithgow, Dennis Franz and Nancy Allen are all somehow involved in the nefarious conspiracy.

Written & directed by Brian De Palma, ""Blow Out” (1981) is a crime drama/thriller whose colors, artistic style, cast and Philadelphia locations make it worthwhile. It’s similar to Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Conversation” (1974) but more dynamic. Allen plays a ditzy character, yet is alluring and enjoyable, while Travolta is in his prime. Meanwhile Lithgow makes for a great shady character.

I loved the colorful, well-staged sequence under the Henry Avenue Bridge, but started to lose interest in the second half for some reason. The storytelling became increasingly contrived. Nevertheless, respectable critics rave about this flick.

I've already seen two of Akira Kurosawa's most renowned films and, quite frankly, I still can't understand why this Japanese director is so commonly considered a cinematic genius. His films are quite good, they're meticulous, there's a lot of attention to detail, but they're not particularly unforgettable… that's what I think.

This film is an adaptation of the plot of “King Lear”, by Shakespeare: a warlord, in the middle of the Japanese feudal era, decides to withdraw and divide his lands, power and castles among his three sons. Only one of them disagrees and warns him that it is highly unlikely that they will stay together as brothers, which provokes the old father's wrath. However, the future proves true for the younger son's words when the two older brothers despise their father and conflicts begin. Driven mad and accompanied only by a fool, the old man ends up mad while the brothers fight each other.

I won't talk about the cast because I don't know these actors. I can only say that they worked well, within the context and the type of film we are talking about. There is an excessive stylization, both in terms of interpretation and in terms of dialogues, which sounds theatrical, forced, but I don't know if that was on purpose. On a technical level, the film has a lot of points in its favor, starting with an excellent cinematography, very colorful and with good lighting. The sets are superb, in particular the castles, recreated to the smallest detail, and the costumes are also good, beautiful and historically credible. I don't think I'll be being unfair if I say that this film probably has some of the best war scenes in period films set in Japan. There is no CGI, special effects have been used judiciously, and the war has been recreated to be as authentic as possible, with hundreds of extras dressed to the nines and a lot of effort on the part of the production. For a historian, you can't ask for more.

The big problem with this movie is that it wasn't made to entertain but to make you think, and it's full of scenes and sequences designed to make the viewer think about what they're watching. It's something that would work, if it weren't sometimes overly cryptic. The audience needs to understand what the director wants to convey, and that often doesn't happen. Furthermore, it is a film that does not spare the audience: it starts very well, it ends very well, but everything in between is unbearably prolonged and distended. What could be said or done in two minutes is done in five minutes, and there are a lot of dialogues and scenes that don't seem to have any function other than to make the film take longer.",7.0
11646,"**Australia was “born” in Turkey.**

This is a very interesting film that addresses Australia and New Zealand's joint participation in the First World War. Both countries had recently gained independence from the United Kingdom, there was no real sense of national identity and, despite the proximity of German colonies in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, there were many Australians who did not want to go to the war alongside the British. It was the English's war, not theirs. The same thing was felt in my country, Portugal, the United Kingdom's oldest ally, but which only entered the First World War in 1916, against the wishes of the English. Portuguese politicians saw the war as a means of giving international prestige to a young and discredited republican regime, and of securing Portuguese sovereignty in Africa and India. Despite having no relationship with each other, the journey of Australians and Portuguese in the First World War had the same end: the CEP, the Portuguese military brigade, was decimated in France, in 1918, in the greatest defeat in the multi-century history of the Portuguese Army; ANZAC almost completely lost itself in the Dardanelles, in the face of the obstinate Turkish defense commanded by Mustafa Kemal, who knew well the terrain and foresaw what the Allies were going to try.

Historical considerations aside, the film does not focus on military action or what happened in the unsuccessful Battle of the Dardanelles. We are taken there by the beautiful friendship between two young Australian athletes with a lot of potential, who enlist in ANZAC (one of them even had to lie because he was too young). I don't know exactly what they expected to do, nor if they did considered the possibility of not returning home alive. I think, as often happens, they wanted to enlist because all the other boys did it so. The script doesn't explore this as it could, and perhaps one of the film's weaknesses is the lack of this emotional and mental depth in decisive moments. I also missed a greater effort at contextualization: anyone who doesn't understand history may not know exactly what that battle was about.

On a technical level, the film stands out for its excellent cinematography, scenery and costumes, and a reconstruction of the period that, overall, works satisfactorily. Of course, it's not technically perfect. For example, in combat scenes there is a great lack of visual and special effects that add intensity to the action, resulting in battles that are not exactly exciting to watch on the big screen. There is also a serious lack of blood here. I'm not a fan of gore or the most visually shocking effects, but stop and think with me: it's a battle, it's war. There are dead, there are injured, there are mutilated, there are screaming people lying on the ground in agony, waiting for their own death and asking for help. The film doesn't show us the raw reality of combat, perhaps to allow for a lower parental rating, which I understand, but honestly don't approve of.

Although the film has a larger cast, naturally, the truth is that the two protagonists, Mel Gibson and Mark Lee, absolutely dominate all the action. It's worth paying attention to the work of the two actors: Gibson still didn't have the stellar status he achieved in Hollywood, and his modesty suited him well. He was a young actor, but he already had the talent that characterizes him, and a friendly smile, a charisma that makes his character pleasant and worthy of empathy. Lee is more important in the script, but he doesn't have the strength and presence of his colleague. He's good, but more discreet and less charismatic. It may have been this, in fact, that didn't help him advance his acting career. The film also features positive appearances by Bill Kerr in a short but significant role.",8.0

I'm not really a comic connoisseur. It was only when I read about this film that I realized that the characters had been taken from that literary universe and from a line of action toys created by the American company Mattel. This is something that helped me to understand the sheer confusion and goofiness of this film, which I think only toy fans will truly appreciate.

The best thing about this movie is the cast. There are some very respectable actors here, and their commitment and talent is remarkable, raising the quality of a cheesy movie quite a bit. Frank Langella's involvement is particularly good. He gave life to the great villain, a being called Skeletor, who looks like Darth Vader in the day he decided to go to Halloween dressed as Death. The character himself isn't impressive, he's a huge cliché without any intimidation ability, but Langella is really enjoying and having fun with this work. On the opposite side is Dolph Lundgren, a herculean and apparently invulnerable young man who came out of the world of combat sports, who doesn't know how to play and has the dramatic qualities of an avocado, but who manages to respond to what is asked of the character. Meg Foster, the proud owner of one of the most beautiful pairs of eyes of her time, has a charisma of her own and does a very good work.

But let's be honest, is anyone going to see a movie just for the cast? I do not think so. It's a good argument, but it doesn't take anyone to the theatre by itself. Does the movie have anything else? Do you have qualities? Is it really worth it? There are audiences for all types of cinema, including kitsch, trash and B cinema. The proof of this is the success of some films that would never convince a person with the least amount of good taste. Therefore, I believe that lovers of “oily sci-fi” will be delighted with this magnificent piece of cheese with a very characteristic taste of the 80s. We have everything: stilted action scenes, choreographed like a Russian ballet, extraordinarily cheap special effects, “DIY” level, a very poor script, characters reduced to sketches, dialogues more melodramatic than a Mexican soap opera, crude make-up (Langella's mask is particularly bad) and many laser shots, in the golden age of lasers and neon.

Meville's pacing is extremely slow – it has to be in order to ensure that the audience understands the complex relationships of who knows who – and suffice it to say, people who don't already like mid-century French auteur films may find this intolerable. However, if you are a fan of the French New Wave, you may find Meville's ability to sustain suspense a delicious torture. This viewer was on the edge of his seat the whole time waiting to find out what would happen next. Melville's visual aesthetic is also consistently attractive: muted colours, careful shots of the characters faces at a couple of key moments, and a striking constrast between the quiet world of these criminals and the bustle of everyday Paris.

I must admit that I was prepared for some disappointment, as this was Meville's third film of criminal conspiracy in three years (preceded by the hitman drama <i>Le Samouraï</i> and the French Resistance saga <i>L'Armée des ombres</i>). However, in spite of Meville's continued interest in the genre, <i>Le Cercle rouge</i> offers something fresh and individual. There are a couple of intertextual looks back to <i>Le Samouraï</i> in the sets, but Meville shows how talented his favourite actors were by having a couple of good guys in that film play baddies in this one and vice versa.

All in all, this is not a must-see, life-changing film, but certainly a classic film that has stood the test of time and well worth seeing.",8.0

Delon recruits the dapper ex-cop with a drink problem - ""Jansen"" (Yves Montand), and the recently escaped ""Vogel"" (Gian Maria Volontè) into his plan to rob an exclusive Parisian jewellers. Situated on the top floor of a town house with state of the art security, they must recce the scene and use all of their initiative and ingenuity to crack the systems and pinch - and dispose of - $20 million worth of loot. Simultaneously, a couple of hoodlums are chasing ""Corey"" after he relieved his former boss of some cash, and the police - led by accomplished copper ""Mattei"" (André Bourvil) are on the hunt for ""Vogel"". I can't say the acting set the thing on fire for me, it is certainly ""cool"" but you can over-do that, and at times these three men are pretty devoid of much depth to their characters. I could also have been doing with more going on in the first hour; the plot establishment all takes too long - but once Jean-Pierre Melville gets his ducks in a row and the film has a clearer focus, then the pace picks up nicely and there is quite a decent degree of tension peppered with the odd bit of dark humour.

Not that the aforementioned is a surprise, of course. Still, this is a great watch, no doubt about it for me. I particularly appreciated the score, which is very good. Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw give strong performances, especially the latter; who kept reminding me of a young Kevin Durand.

As you'd expect, this has many early hallmarks of Nolan's work - the obvious being the non-linear storytelling. I really like how the story is told here, the premise is intriguing and it ends up wrapping up nicely. The 70 minute run time, although not unwelcome, is shorter than I wanted, only because I happily would've watched this flick develop further.

To rectify matters, he and his pal ""Joey"" (Johnny Murphy) - aka 'The Lips"" decide to hold auditions to create a band. A band with an unique sound to challenge the prevailing mediocrity. After some frankly hilarious auditions that pitch the tone deaf straight into the arms of the fashion police, the pair manage to assemble ten folks as different as gin and Guinness. It's no easy task moulding these disparate and lively individuals into one coherent unit, but oddly enough - despite their differences - it's the music from the likes of Mack Rice (""Mustang Sally""), Al Green & Teenie Hodges and a range of established American soul songsters who manage to provide them all with a common language and purpose as they gradually start to gain some traction amongst a sceptical community and an even more cynical music business. It's fair to say that neither ""Lips"" nor ""Jimmy"" are high on the list at the diplomatic corps, so keeping these people from - quite literally at times - tearing each other apart is no mean feat. Being a Scot of a certain age from Glasgow, it's easy for me to appreciate the old adage that for many, the escape from post-industrial poverty was music - and both Danny Boyle and Roddy Doyle work well to create and engagingly plausible story of folks whose ambition is not to win a Grammy, but to have enough money to buy their kids milk in the morning. Those they assemble for the band are a myriad of characterful and colourful folks - some likeable, some certainly not - but put them on stage and the toes start tapping and all is forgiven.

Get Smart is hilarious. Just good clean, hilarious fun. Steve Carrell is in his sweet spot with all kinds of physical comedy and side-splitting sarcasm. This movie feels every bit like a spy comedy starring Michael Scott from the Office, except this time with a much bigger budget than Threat Level Midnight. I don't know how the cast could keep a straight face with Steve Carrell's performance as outrageous and entertaining as it was. Anne Hathaway was an excellent partner reacting to Carrell's nonsense with many of her own clever moments. Having watched re-runs of the original TV show with my grandparents growing up, it was easy to see how the movie honored the show's spirit while increasing the budget, effects, and laughs. Director Peter Segal has a resume filled with goofy films and several of which involve espionage and law enforcement, making him the perfect director for a movie like this.

Anita and Roger meet overly cute, and their dogs Pongo (his) and Perdy (hers) fall in love, too. Anita and Roger marry, and get pregnant. Pongo and Perdy marry, and get pregnant. Poor Perdy squeezes out fifteen puppies, under the watchful, slumming eye of Joan Plowright, playing Nanny. Cruella returns and offers to buy the puppies. Inspired by one of Anita's designs, she plans to make a giant fur coat out of them. She and her henchmen have been collecting puppies, and these final fifteen will give her her frock. Anita and Roger do not sell. The puppies are dognapped by henchmen Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams), who look exactly like their animated counterparts from the better Disney film. The very long finale is one giant rescue scene, as the puppies are helped by other animals to escape, with Cruella, the henchmen, and a psychotic mute taxidermist named Skinner (John Shrapnel) on their collective tails.

Screenwriter John Hughes apes his ""Home Alone"" ingredient of having grown men injured by cute creatures so often, I though I was watching an unofficial sequel. Director Stephen Herek is no Chris Columbus, however. While Columbus can direct (usually), Herek is all over the place, not quite sure what he should be capturing in order to double over the audience with laughter. The scene where Anita and Roger meet after wrecking their bikes thanks to their runaway dogs is milked for all it is worth and runs way too long. The editing is not tight, as Herek switches back and forth between multiple cameras, and capturing extreme close-ups of ""funny business"" instead of just letting the actors be funny. Daniels and Richardson get lost in the shuffle, making no impression on the audience whatsoever. Glenn Close is just right for the part, with some amazing costumes and hair, but she seems reined in as well. The film makers cannot decide if their audience is innocent children or their tired parents. Some of the dialogue is harsh, like the villains' plans for the puppies, but that is offset by sugar coating too many scenes, including the finale. There are also a couple of clips from other Disney films in the movie, but this does not seem like an inside joke so much as free advertising for other Disney videos. In the end, ""101 Dalmatians"" fails to deliver on its intent. Close almost breaks free from the shackles of marketing mediocrity, but the real loser here is the audience.

The animation is superb with just the right amount of music that doesn't overwhelm the storyline but does give us the memorable song of Cruella Deville. Speaking of the villain, Cruella is an iconic and fantastically over-the-top character, with Horace and Jasper adding to the trio's incredible dynamic.

The film is a delightful experience from start to finish, a complete classic that has been a box office success and is one of Walt Disney's triumphs. Moving forward, the live-action films, 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians, are based on the cartoon and offer a fresh take on the story with Glenn Close's portrayal of Cruella Deville being particularly outstanding.

While the movies may have a few plot holes, they are still top-notch entertainment. The sequel, 101 Dalmatians Part 2 in the Animated Series, focuses on Patch's adventures in London, adding a new dimension to the beloved story. Although the animated series may not reach the same heights as the original or the movies, it is still worth a watch for fans of the franchise.

It's 20 years since Michael Myers Haddonfield, and in particular Laurie Srode, his sister. Laurie faked her death and is now a divorced mom with a teenage son. Michael is on his way to finish the job he couldn't finish two decades ago.

A true and honest Halloween/Michael Myers film this one, there's the distinct feeling that the people behind the series wanted to show that they remember what made the series popular in the first place. It's still the stalk and slash formula of course, but Jamie Lee Curtis returns and her character is nicely written. She's obviously still haunted by events passed and needs a stiff few drinks from time to time to keep the edge off. Yet she's in charge of a private school and is a stern but adoring mother to her son (Josh Hartnett). And she has a boyfriend (Adam Arkin) who cares for her.

The first half of film sets up Laurie's new world, while we jump back and forth observing Michael on his journey to final destination. Once the second half revs up, it's the scare time as Laurie's son and his friends come under great peril, which we know will lead to a final confrontation with Laurie. The kills strike hard, the suspense is ramped up, and then it's a frenetic action based finale capped off by a coup de grace of some distinction.

Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is living in Northern California under an assumed name as a dean of a remote private school. It’s Halloween season and her son (Josh Hartnett) is turning 17. Will her evil brother show-up to wreak terror once again? Of course he will. Adam Arkin, LL Cool J and Janet Leigh have side roles.

“Halloween 4” (1988) was great and IMHO even better than the original 1978 slasher while “Halloween 5” (1989) was good, although it added a little campy humor. The next film, “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995), was surprisingly a mess with weak characters, lousy story development and stale & pedestrian jump scares. So I didn’t know what to expect with 1998’s “Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later.”

The movie starts in Illinois with a glimmer of humor and the final scene of the character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt made me bust out laughing. From there, the tone turns dramatic as events switch to the posh boarding school in California. The characters are confidently established and we feel we know them as Michael Myers stages his assault.

I’m glad the creators decided to finally switch the setting from Haddonfield, Illinois, to a wholly different locale across the country. Haddonfield was getting tired. The plot is similar to “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,” which was released a few months later. “H2O” is arguably the second best sequel in the series after 4 and is at least on par with 5.

It’s great to have Jamie Lee as the ‘final girl’ again. Michelle Williams also appears on the female front. She was only 17 during shooting and cute as can be. The attractive Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is also on hand.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: As the story continues the believability decreases severely. In fact, the crisis/suspense/action sequences are so EXTREME and strung so close together (especially as the movie proceeds) they tend to make you bust out laughing -- the very OPPOSITE reaction the creators wanted. By the very end the ridiculous overkill made me lose interest in whatever story was supposed to be there.

11683,"Romero lines up the Bush administration for à la carte eats.

Land Of The Dead is directed & written by George A. Romero and it's the fourth film in his Zombie based series of films. It stars Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Eugene Clark & Asia Argento.

Human society has regrouped and formed a new community in a sealed off section of America. Run by a feudal government headed by Paul Kaufman (Hopper), the state survives on supplies garnered from the outside world by Riley (Baker) and his ""Dead Reckoning"" team. But during one of their raids they notice that one of the Zombies, Big Daddy (Clark), is starting to show signs of human awareness.

After the emergence of the Dawn Of The Dead remake in 2004 and the plaudits heaped upon zom-com Shaun Of The Dead also in 2004, one question immediately sprang to the minds of zombie fans, ""could Romero, the don of the dead, be stirred into a new entry in his already heralded series?"". Yes was the joyous answer to that, and although a torn ligament down from previous instalments, the great news is that Land Of The Dead rocks with gore and politico fervour. Naturally a lot has changed in the world of zombiedom since Romero's last venture in 85, but he manages to tonally keep the old fashioned feel while observing the unsteady social climate that was seeping from the wounds in 2005.

By his own admission he is taking pot shots at the Bush administration, while Hopper, on delightfully excessive form, deliberately channels Donald Rumsfeld. From fireworks in the sky bringing conformity, to class division down on the turf, Romero as always has something to say. The cast are a solid and energetic bunch, with Baker pleasingly coming up trumps as a hero type, while gore hounds are very well served here as George finds new and inventive ways of delivering the ick (one ""head"" sequence is genius). Sure there's a suggestion that the central idea of the zombies getting smarter is kind of going off tangent, but since he wrote the rules, he's also allowed to change them. But with this ending here it offers hope, not just in this skew whiff world he's created, but also of further film's to come. And that maybe is a touch too far? 7/10",7.0

One of the earlier films that made Van Damme into a star, Bloodsport finds Van Damme as real life martial artist Frank Dux. Dux enters into the famed Kumite, a no nonsense tournament in Hong Kong and must overcome various hurdles to hopefully achieve his goals.

As is the norm for a Van Damme action movie, particularly where his late 80s and early 90s output is concerned, one has to be prepared for some at best average acting and a flimsy plot. Plot follows a familiar Van Damme trajectory, his character will yearn to overcome adversity, go through a strenuous training programme, meet and make friends and enemies, produce some outstanding martial artistry, and end up in a winner takes all fight for justice, revenge, honour...

Away from the seriously great fighting skills showcased by Van Damme and the other martial artists he comes up against, there's not a lot of artistic film making craft on show. But as fans of this sort of stuff will tell you, and I'm one of that number, it matters not, for they deliver exactly what we expect. Great fight choreography, a super Kumite montage, a vile villain who needs his ass kicked, and of course lots of Van Damage as we hurtle towards what we hope will be a triumphant finale. Hooray!

Alcohol empowers us, reduces our inhibitions certainly; but to what extent we will do what instinct and urge tell us to is well presented here. Personally, I thought Carlqvist and Andersson stole the scenes - their characters purveying something natural, visceral and usually quite entertaining, too.

Gradually we become aware of just what did happen, but the presentation avoids making it a simple good v. evil style story, but actually one as much about redemption and maybe even forgiveness. Dickie holds it together well enough but maybe she's left to do a bit too much of the heavy lifting as neither Curran nor Martin Compston's ""Stevie"" do very much to add any depth to a screenplay or characterisation that does take it's time to get going.

There is some fairly graphic sex, but it's not prurient - it's all part of the natural evolution of her plan within a bigger plan - and that works effectively. It also makes you realise that it's not that hard to concoct a story plausible to many that's a complete work of well orchestrated fiction too.

As Wes tries to bring down the killer, he is battling to realign his mindset about the female sex, his daughters and also Beryl Thibodeaux (Bujold), the latter the rape counsellor who was once his sparring adversary, but is now a potential lover if Wes can put everything back on an even keel.

Tuggle, Eastwood and Surtees bring plenty of film noir touches to their picture. Surtees’ photography is strong in colour but dark in shading, perfectly embodying the seamy side of The Big Easy. Between them, actor and director fill out this fascinating tale with classic noirish scenes. A Mardi Gras warehouse is eerie, as is a chase through a cemetery, then there’s clowns and balloons, things that are associated with childish fun but so often in noirville carry a sinister edge. The sleazy dives that Wes frequents are foreboding places of sin, more so when the killer is stalking his prey. While a railroad location is used to great effect as well.

It has some problems, Hedaya is wasted and the Wes and Beryl relationship is telegraphed a mile away. While the formula of such movies inevitably means the culmination of tale is no surprise, but the journey is a dark and interesting one and Tightrope is a damn fine thriller. 8/10",8.0
11707,"***Dramatic, melancholic Eastwood detective flick set in New Orleans*** 

A divorced detective in New Orleans (Clint Eastwood) juggles raising two daughters, pursing a serial rapist/killer, cultivating a romantic relationship (Geneviève Bujold) and dealing with his own dark side, which he realizes is too close for comfort to the killer.

“Tightrope” (1984) is another Eastwood detective flick, but it’s not as entertaining and compelling as his Dirty Harry films or “The Gauntlet” (1977). It’s darker, more dramatic and brooding, not to mention a tad sleazy. This may bring to mind the original “Dirty Harry” (1971), but the subdued tone is closer to “Blood Work” (2002).

The title refers to a person walking the tightrope between his/her good side and bad side.

The movie runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot entirely in New Orleans.

<em>'Tightrope'</em> should have all the ingredients to make the viewer be on the edge of their seat, and yet I really didn't care much for it. Clint Eastwood, who apparently took over unofficially as director from Richard Tuggle during filming, gives a solid performance and the bond with his character's children is cute.

However, the story just didn't do anything for me. It's not particularly unnerving, despite a dark on paper story, and it's rather predictable - the villain... well, the villain I've already forgotten about and I only finished watching about an hour ago.

11708,"Fantasmagorical!

Based on the novel written by James Bond creator Ian Flemming, this delightful fantasy charts the journey into the mysteriously childless world of Vulgaria by Caractacus Potts, his two children, Truly Scrumptious and super car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

I think the main thing that makes this film work so well is that it has a little of everything to make a successful family movie. Catchy tunes at every turn, a fairy tale kingdom awash with colour, bonkers technology, and a little slice of wickedness involving class distinction. Split very much into two halves, Chitty at its core is really about forming a complete family. We are introduced to Caracatus (Dick Van Dyke) who is a single father, who is doing his best to raise his two children with moral fortitude. It's through the children's love of an old rusty car that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is born, and after pretty lady Truly Scrumptious (a gorgeous Sally Ann Howes) comes into their lives, all four of them enter the second half of the movie after having firmly capturing the audience's attention with a firming promise of a family in waiting.

The second half of the picture then whisks us far away into fantasy territory. Vulagaria is ruled by crackers toy obsessive Baron Bomburst (Gert Fröbe in wonderful bacon sandwich mode), he has banned children, and naturally he has his sights set firmly on the magnificence that is Chitty Chitty. Bomburst sends out his child snatcher to nab Caracatus' kids in the hope of bargaining for the special car. The child snatcher played by Robert Helpman is as iconic as he is terrifying, wonky hat and pointy nose he lures children in with promises of sweets and treacle tarts, he thus became the invader of many a childs poor nightmares for sure.

Sure, it has it's cheesy moments, but there is genuine chemistry between the characters on display here and coupled with some superbly catchy - and often poignant - lyrics from the Sherman twins, we are presented with a really quite enjoyable fable. The Potts family live in a dilapidated farmhouse. Grandfather (Lionel Jeffries); the well meaning but hopeless inventor of a father ""Caractacus"" (Dick Van Dyke) and the two children ""Jeremy"" (Adrian Hall) and ""Jemima"" (Heather Ripley). Luckily, one day the youngsters are nearly run over by ""Truly"" (Sally Ann Howes) the daughter of the wealthy confectioner ""Lord Scrumptious"" (James Robertson Justice). She might just be able to help the father make a few quid from her father with his sweets that double up as pan pipes. Meantime, the family manage to rescue an old rust bucket from the local garage, and lo and behold, enter our eponymous vehicle. It can drive, it can become an aeroplane, an hovercraft - indeed it can do just about everything bar make the tea. It's a must-have prize for the megalomaniac child-hater ""Baron Bomburst"" (Gert Fröbe - who really does enter into the spirit of the story), so the family must fight tooth and nail to stop their car, and themselves, falling into his malevolent hands. Ian Fleming demonstrates great imagination with this and Van Dyke shows off his varied skills well and engagingly. Howes over-cooks her singing at times, but the almost 2½ hours this story takes really does fly by. The Oscar winning ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""; the delightful ""Hushabye Mountain""; ""Me Ol' Bamboo"" and Jeffries' enjoyable rendition of ""Posh!"" as he is gradually drowned in his outhouse all add bundles to this colourful and joyous series of well photographed escapades.

11710,"Right - despite the fact that this is based on an actual man and actual events, it is pretty aptly titled. Werner Herzog takes a bit of a punt with his chronology of the life of Kaspar Hauser (a strong performance from Bruno S.) but there are very few definites here except for the fact that we know (or come to know) that he had spent most of his childhood chained to a bed in a cellar with his only human contact coming from a man clad in black who fed and watered him daily. Then he released him, barely mobile or able to speak, into 1820s Nuremberg armed only with the clothes he stood up in and a note for the local soldiers. The rest of the tale unravels via a mixture of a conversation from the man himself with housekeeper ""Käthe"" (Brigitte Mira) about his past whilst we also focus on how various elements of society try to ingratiate, capitalise upon and analyse the young man before his untimely death spawns an whole new slew of sometimes fantastic conspiracy theories. At times there's something akin to Dumas' ""Man in the Iron Mask"" to the thread - could he be the illegitimate son of a grandee, a rich and powerful person? Well there's the enigma - we didn't know then and maybe we never will know - and that's the concept that this film juggles quite entertainingly and provocatively. He can barely speak yet picks language up quickly and efficiently. Writing likewise. Might that suggest he comes from learned stock? We are presented with a man virginal in almost every extent - his lack of exposure to his own kind leaving him naive and vulnerable but also eager and not always endearing. His personality is an open book initially, but he colours it in quite quickly and that's as much due to those vying for influence as he gradually become more forthcoming. It all ends rather sadly, and inexplicably - so don't anticipate closure. It's a series of questions with not so many, satisfactory at any rate, answers. The production looks good, the story consistently paced and we are left with an intriguing conundrum delivered by a solid cast of character actors who encapsulate not just his predicament but their own agenda too.",7.0
11710,"**_The real-life story of the mysterious Kaspar Hauser put to film by Werner Herzog_**

A young man shows up in the square of a town in Bavaria in 1828 (Bruno S.), but he can only speak a few words and can hardly walk. The note in his hand was from someone who cared for him near the Bavarian border since he was an infant. It stated that he had never been let outside the house and wanted to be a cavalryman, like his father. The teenager finds himself becoming a ‘hit’ and stirs up much attention.  

“The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser” (1974) was Herzog’s follow-up to his acclaimed “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” from two years prior. While I think Herzog’s forthcoming “Fitzcarraldo” is great, I found this a little disappointing. For one thing, Bruno S was 42 years-old during shooting whereas the real-life Hauser was only 16 when he was found. I guess that’s why Herzog changed his birthdate from 1812 to 1810 for the movie. Since it was common in cinema at the time to cast way older actors as teenagers (which is still done occasionally today), I suppose this can be forgiven.

Besides, Werner realized after writing the script that it would be challenging to find an actor to play such an extreme role convincingly. However, when he saw Bruno S. in a documentary and learned of his difficult childhood, the son of an abusive prostitute and spending many years in institutions, even being the subject of Nazi experiments on mentally-disabled kids, he decided to cast him because of his extraordinary mental circumstances.

A couple of other issues are that Hauser’s cell in his youth was reported to be 4 feet by 7 and not high enough for him to stand upright, which are of much bigger dimensions in the movie. Plus, the flick supports the idea that Hauser’s captor is one-and-the-same as the person who supposedly attacks him with a knife after he acquires fame, which doesn’t jibe with the known possibility that Hauser was addicted to the attention he got for being “special” and committed the stab wounds himself in order to work up interest when his popularity started to wane. Since we don’t know the facts, this element should’ve at least been kept ambiguous in the film.  

While you can’t beat the authentic locations, I found the proceedings a little boring with a highlight here or there. This wasn’t helped by the one-dimensional portrayal of the title character but, then, how else would such a peculiar individual be depicted? So, I guess it comes down to how interested you are in the subject matter. At the very least, the movie gives you a decent visual of what actually happened 200 years ago in Bavaria.

A more compelling ’70’s Euro-flick that takes place in a comparable setting and has a similar ‘feel’ is “Mysteries” from 1978, based on Knut Hamsun’s 1892 novel. For entertaining exploitation in the same general milieu, see Klaus Kinski’s “Jack the Ripper” from 1976.       

It runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Dinkelsbühl, which is an hour’s drive southwest of Nuremberg in Bavaria, Germany.

11712,"This is a superb adventure story with Toshirô Mifune reprising his role from ""Yojimbo"" as the wandering samurai warrior. This time he arrives in a village facing some local corruption. The ""Chamberlain"" has been framed by the superintendent of a clan, who tries to secure his tenuous position by killing off any detractors. ""Sanjûrô"" decides to help protect them, and is soon drawn into the battle that requires all of his skills and know-how (of course, they are completely outnumbered). The plot interveaves a story of local politics nicely with a lust for power, and a coming of age for many of the locals who are in awe of their warrior leader. Takako Irie is quite interesting as the wife of the arrested Chamberlain; she looks every inch the prim and proper Japanese wife, but is frequently (and to Mifune's chagrin, on occasion) the character delivering some quite insightful and learned comment; she seems to have the measure of the Samurai! I found Mifune's performance to be engaging and charming - he deals with his men as a teacher might his pupils, sometimes with humour, other times with discipline - but always with care; and that speaks more to the way Kurosawa develops the characterisations - with integrity and class. It's still got it's fair share of action and there are loads of sword-fights to keep the plot moving along until it all comes to an head.

Local taverna owner ""Giff Hoyt"" (Charles Bronson) smells a rat, and that smell gets stronger when ""Marie"" (Dominique Sanda) arrives in town and falls foul of the local authorities that seems a little too beholden to local German businessman ""Gunther Beckdorff"" (Jason Robards). Something is afoot - and it doesn't take them long to suss out that there might be gold on a wreck just off the coast. Comparisons with ""Casablanca"" (1942) are certain to be drawn but though there are plot similarities, the comparison ends pretty sharpish - this is simply nowhere near as good. There is far too much dialogue, a distinct lack of subtlety and style as the story develops and a paucity of action as Bronson is clearly just interested in collecting his fee. The ending is brash and garish too and this whole adventure offers precious little to engage the audience. Forgettable film, that, luckily, is easy to forget.",5.0

The Haunting is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Nelson Gidding from the Shirley Jackson novel The Haunting of Hill House. It stars Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn and Lois Maxwell. Music is by Humphrey Searle and cinematography by David Boulton.

Hill House has a troubled history, death, either by accident or by suicide, has occurred there over the years. Today, Dr. Markway, an anthropologist and investigator of paranormal activity, leads a team of four for a stay at Hill House, where they will stay for a period of time in the hope that Markway can prove something paranormal resides there

The haunted house premise has been a staple for horror film makers since forever. To place the viewer in a murky house, alongside some character unfortunates, and then scare the tar out of them has always been the aim. It hasn't often worked to great effect, in fact the number of genuine scary haunted house movies barely trouble the fingers of both hands. How strange, then, that the best of the bunch chose a simple formula that has never been replicated since with the same great effect.

The Haunting thrives not on what it throws at you by way of jumps and peek-a-boo visceral shocks, it deals firmly in the realm of what you can't see scares you the most. Where we have to use our own fretful imaginations to fill in the blanks for us, which is never a good thing in psychological horror parlance. Robert Wise, a most gifted and versatile director, uses oblique camera angles, thundering sound effects and angled close ups of his actors to get the maximum amount of atmosphere from the premise.

Distortion is very much a key component here. We are told the history of the house and some of its structural quirks, the camera angles heighten this for ethereal impact whilst simultaneously marrying up to the distortion of a key character's mental health. The story in essence sounds simple, yet there is much bubbling away in Hill House, both on the page and up there on the screen. This is not simply a case of a group of people being haunted by a spectre or otherwise, the mind is a key player here, very much so.

Along the way are some truly breath holding scenes; a bending door, pounding in the corridor, a face on the wall (the lighting here genius), Nell's hand holding incident, a rickety spiral staircase that we fear from the off, and the ghostly finale as Hill House reveals its hand and what we thought was a simple and true narrative is actually more clever, more chilling than we first imagined. Suggestion is a very big thing in The Haunting, it's what drives it to greatness, but it also has scenes that really bring the gooseflesh jumping up on your arms.

The acting is mostly great, with Tamblyn and Johnson correctly underplaying their roles to let the two girls take centre stage. Both Harris and Bloom are excellent. As Nell, Harris is nervous, introverted and caught up in the atmosphere of the house, it's the pivotal role and Harris instills a heart aching fragility into the character. Bloom as Theodora has mystical qualities, a sexiness and a devilishly playful disposition, things that play off of Harris' egg shell walking quite brilliantly. While the house itself (exterior is Ettington Park Hotel in Stratford-Upon-Avon) is an ominous character all of its own. As Nell first spies the monolithic frontage she muses that it's a monster waiting to swallow her, a small creature, whole; we know exactly how she feels.

Still the template haunted house movie, accept no substitutes and ignore stupid claims of homophobia, this is intelligent, scary and crafted with great skill. 10/10",10.0
11772,"**A simple film with a basic script, but which scares us in such a way that it still has an influence on horror productions today.**

Movies about haunted houses? Whoever saw one of them, saw them all… right? I like to think not. And this film is probably the grandfather of a good number of them! Currently forgotten due to the passage of time, the film had a much weaker remake in 1999, and I believe that it is itself a rewrite of “House on Haunted Hill”, released three years earlier, in 1959, and which also has already deserved a new production in recent years. The impact of this film on the industry and horror genre was notable and continues to have some echoes.

The story begins by introducing us to Hill House, a fateful mansion shrouded in a cloak of mystery and a past of death. Unlike the modern remake, this film never explores the origins of that evil, it simply accepts it and places the characters inside the house, under the pretext of a paranormal investigation clumsily led by a parapsychologist obsessed with proving the veracity of haunting phenomena and the afterlife.

As a story told, the film is frankly poor and leaves us with more questions than answers. We are presented with a psychological experiment conducted without criteria and which, if it had been true, would have shocked the scientific community and led to a variety of legal consequences. Do I need to say that the study would have to stop at the first sign of danger to the mental health of one of the participants? Issues that seem logical, such as the fact that the subjects volunteer in writing, after fully knowing what will be done and the risks, are put aside, as are the hostile attitudes of the caretakers, who are not satisfied with the additional work, or the passivity of Eleanor's family, which only appears to show how uprooted the character would feel.

The cast is not very well known but makes a commendable effort. Lois Maxwell is perhaps the most easily known name, but she appears for a very short time and doesn't add much with her participation. She gives life, moreover, to the most apparently sane person in the midst of that madness. And I'm not saying that I don't believe in the supernatural: in fact I do, but I'm more afraid of the living than the dead and I don't accept any nonsense. It's Julie Harris who dominates the screen with an inspired and crazy interpretation of someone living on the brink of a mental breakdown. She is friendly, and we agonize with her scares and fear. Claire Bloom also does an interesting, more restrained and sarcastic job.

If the audience is expecting fluttering sheets or skeletons animated by nylon strings, it's best to forget: the film does not use carnival tricks, preferring to intelligently use sound, image, shadows and camera angles to create an atmosphere of tension and threat. The result is frankly positive: when we don't see what scares us, we don't know what to expect, and that intimidates us. Knocks on wood, heavy footsteps, punches against doors, muffled laughter, the range of sound effects is rich and was used in a creative and very credible way. The filming location, a huge English neo-Gothic mansion, is wonderful and was put to great use. All interior settings are exquisitely crafted and look authentic. The house itself is a dense, rich and mysterious character, a villain worthy of an anthology.",9.0

It's this house that ""Dr. Markway"" (Richard Johnson) is determined to investigate. He has convinced the new owner ""Mrs Sannerson"" (Fay Compton) to allow him and his team to try to prove or disprove for once and for all whether there are such things as ghosts! This house will be the ideal venue for his work and assisted by her rather feckless nephew ""Luke"" (Russ Tamblyn) as well as the spiritual medium ""Theodora"" (Clare Bloom) and the young ""Nell"" (Julie Harris) who seems nervously plugged-in to the house and it's secrets. As night falls, and for the next few days we discover that there are indeed some horrific tales surrounding this edifice involving abuse both physical and psychological amongst it's occupants. Needless to say, these shenanigans profoundly affect the young ""Nell"" and as she struggles, those fears seem to become contagious as pretty soon everyone is equally spooked by numerous terrifyingly inexplicable activities going on in this house. The question is, though, is this really activity from another dimension or might cold and calculating minds be trying a bit of manipulation. This is a genuinely quite scary adaptation of the book that uses some dimly lit and rather brutal photography, a fair degree of skilfully produced audio and two strong performances from Bloom and Harris to help create an escalating sense of the menacing as panic sets in and rational thinking jumps out of the window. This isn't an horror film that relies on ketchup and jellied eyes, it's a good deal more sophisticated and unlike many of it's contemporaries, it really does cultivate a sense of jeopardy until very near a conclusion that I certainly didn't really anticipate until pretty near the end.

Though over three hours long, it's astonishing, paced so achingly right and I can see why he rightfully earned the 'carte blanche' that would unfortunately lead to his downfall (as well as an entire studio's) as soon as he made his next film. But to reach such heights and to have such ambition--as well as undeniable talent--is a victory in and of itself.

11778,"Did Michael Cimino ever make another movie? I wouldn't be surprised if not after this harrowing and intense look at the human psyche after it's exposure to the brutalities of war. The war was in Vietnam, and the protagonists here are those who survived - to varying degrees - to return home to what they hope will be some sort of normality. To some semblance of what they left behind. To some humanity. The three men all come from an Ohio sawmill town via some Eastern Europe antecedence, and they willingly enlist to fight for their country ""Michael"" (Robert De Niro), ""Nicky"" (Christopher Walken) and ""Steven"" (John Savage). It's the latter man who has just got married and so who feels a great wrench when they are almost summarily deployed. That deployment sees them captured, tortured and exposed to the most deadly game of Russian roulette you're ever likely to witness. The narrative now splices a little so we can follow the three character's individual experiences in escaping and trying to get home. The way the threads weave here is hugely impactful on the presentation of the story to the audience. The characterful efforts - especially from Savage, and a really taut and considered direction allow us to observe the impact of the conflict not just on the men - physically, emotionally and psychologically; but on those left behind. Those epitomised by ""Linda"" (Meryl Streep) whose needs are torn between loyalty to those absent and need for comfort from those not. It's not meant to be an history, cinematic licence abounds. This is essentially a darkly written observation of the consequences of war, or trauma and of loyalty. It could be about any war. These are not soldiers, they are barely-trained young men in uniform and the plot could just as readily apply to any other people drafted in to fight for a cause they didn't understand in a place they'd probably never heard of. Does it need to be three hours long? My jury is out on that. It does allow itself to meander at times, but the more I watch it the more I wonder if Cimino hasn't built in some necessary steam valves for us to rest from the intensity of the characterisations here. The intensity of the photography and Stanley Myers score - with some almost incongruous help from the guitar themed ""Cavatina"" by (the other) John Williams makes this as must for a big screen, makes you think a bit and certainly offers career best roles from Walken and Savage.",7.0
11780,"Do not think that all sins go unpunished in this life, Montrose. 

Rob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub.

Neeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows £1,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born.

Beautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different and more reflective type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department as well. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats - even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish...

Cast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for being dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, and thus Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. However, it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new there? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period.

""Rob Roy"" came out in 1995 with a couple other heroic swordplay films: ""Braveheart"" and ""First Knight."" I prefer ""Rob Roy"" to ""Braveheart,"" even though the two films shouldn't really be compared since ""Rob Roy"" focuses on the conflict of individuals in Old Scotland and ""Braveheart"" focuses more on whole armies battling.

The location cinematography of the Scottish Highlands is breathtaking (and superior to ""Braveheart""). Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange are fine in the roles of Rob Roy and his wife. The sword-fighting (between individuals) ranks with the best in cinematic history. The film also possesses a very realistic vibe -- no anachronisms or campy humor here; the pic really helps one realize what life was like in rural Scotland 300 years ago.

What works best, to my mind, is Tim Roth's exceptional performance as Rob Roy's foppish-but-deadly nemesis. This is a villain you love to loathe. The Roth character is so foppish that he appears somewhat effeminate; but this is merely disguise as he's actually a ruthless master swordsman. Surely this is one of film's top villains ever (It doesn't sound right to say ""good villain,"" does it?).

On the downside, the story doesn't have a lot of drive from beginning to end unlike, say, ""Last of the Mohicans."" Your attention may wander at points. Of course this may not be an entirely bad thing in light of the schizophrenic editing of many films post-""Armageddon"" (1998). In other words, the leisurely pace can be refreshing.

There are aspects not appropriate for children: Sexual brutality (a rape scene) and vulgarity (a man shoves his fingers up a woman's nightgown); as well as blatant love-making. There are also overt scenes of, believe it or not, urination; many may regard this as needless, but (for me) it helped drive home the point of what everyday life was like back then, e.g. Where do you pee if you're living in a shack out in the hills? Or, in the middle of the night, if there's no upstairs bathroom?

The story's lack of drive prevents ""Rob Roy"" from attaining true greatness in my mind, but the positive aspects noted above certainly achieve greatness and there are several memorable scenes.

The film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot entirely in Scotland.

11780,"As a Scot, I tend to look upon the Hollywood treatment of our national history with considerable disdain at the best of times - this is not a film that encourages me to change that philosophy. The general heather and whisky sentiment; the unsophisticated but honourable Scots versus the evil, occupying English is all way to simplistic to be anything more than a romantic adventure drama along the lines of the ""Master of Ballantrae"". Sure, it's grittier than that - the language more course/authentic (take your pick) but both John Hurt as the turncoat Marquis of Montrose and Tim Roth (who perhaps thinks this is a ""Three Musketeers"" romp?) camp it up to the point where you wouldn't have put much money on them escaping from a Parisian brothel unscathed; much less raping, pillaging and ruthlessly scheming to supplant Scottish traditions in favour of their new Hanoverian masters. Eric Stolz and Brian Cox's casting is just bizarre! Andrew Keir, wooden as ever, makes some effort as the Duke of Argyll - another supporter of King George. It has the benefits of some stunning scenery and a cracking score from Carter Burwell, but otherwise it is a mediocre costume drama with a cursory nod to a great Scottish hero.",6.0

Hong Kong has a long history of good action cinema, but this movie didn't seem that good and interesting to me. Many people love it, they say it is wonderful, and I accept that very well, I think that everyone has their own tastes, but the truth is that the film did not work for me. Sounds like an excuse for an action movie.

John Woo is a director I don't know very well. I liked “The Killer” and, therefore, I decided to see this film: it is considered, by many people, one of the director's best. They're not even alike. It is noted that it is the same director, there is a certain style and look, and some shooting options, which are in both films, but we lack a good script, a convincing story. From the middle, sensibly, the director's brutality and bloodlust lose the brake: in minutes, we watch in the armchair what we can only classify as a gratuitous bloodbath (false, obviously).

I would like to talk a little about the actors, but I felt that none of them has the time, space and material to represent a character properly. They are there to kill or die, according to the wishes and desires of the Machiavellian Woo, who abuses visual effects, brutality, the toughest and most soulless action that we can see on a cinema screen. Loaded with graphic effects that accompany a cinematography worthy of an industrial rock music video, the film takes us from massacre to massacre and, before halfway through, we already begin to doubt that there is a live cast. In truth, and to be fair, the film also has the grace of being quite immersive, be it for the good use of sound effects, be it for its magnificently adequate soundtrack, be it for the fast and visceral filming. We are part of that, we are there. And that makes it even harder to bear, depending on how insensitive you can be.",1.0

Elwood P. Dowd is a charming harmless fella, he takes a drink or two for sure, but he's a delightful human being regardless. So why then does his sister want to have him committed to a home for the insane? Ah well you see, Elwood has an invisible friend who happens to be a six-foot-three rabbit!

Faithfully adapted by Mary Chase from her hit Broadway play, Harvey remains to this day a wonderful fantasy comedy that delights all members of the family. It's the kind of film that leaves a warm glow once the credits role, it's basic premise is one of fantastical whimsy as Elwood drives all around him to distraction with his discourse with the invisible Harvey. It's here that the film has a rather naughty streak because Elwood actually appears to be the only sane person on show, all around him is chaos, but he remains calm and completely at peace with his lot.

Starring as Elwood is James Stewart (Academy Award nominated), and it's a very special memorable performance as he carries off with ease the eccentric nature of the character. Stealing the show as Elwood's sister Veta, is Josephine Hull (Aademy Award winner best supporting actress}, completely flustered and effervescent with comic timing precision. Solid support comes from Peggy Dow (why didn't she do more movies?), Charles Drake and the always watchable Cecil Kellaway. The direction from Henry Koster I personally find uneven, at times too hectic when the magic moment has passed, it's as if he was caught between making a screwball comedy or just a basic fantastical one. I often wonder what Frank Capra could have done with this particular adaptation? Still, the film remains much beloved by many, and I'm certainly counting myself amongst that number.

With the constant comparisons to Laurence Olivier, Branagh smartly tackled many diverse film styles so as not to be boxed into being _""The Shakespeare guy""_.

A group of 30 year old friends gather to celebrate their friendship from their theater years at University.  The screenplay is by American actress/comedian Rita Rudner and her husband Martin Bergman. They are able to bring a unique perspective to the high British environments and phobias.  To top it off, Rita also portrays the American in the film in a funny turn.

11791,"_**There’s a reason you’ve never heard of this Hammer flick with Cushing & Lee**_

Around the turn of the century, Sherlock Holmes (Peter Cushing) and Doctor Watson (André Morell) try to protect the heir of the Baskerville estate (Christopher Lee) in southwest England after the former owner was found dead, rumored to be victim of a curse going back to the time of the English Civil War in the mid-1600s.

""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (1959) is Hammer’s take on Arthur Conan Doyle’s oft-filmed tale. While there are some minor changes to the story, it doesn’t “wildly” deviate as some have criticized. It features the lush colors and Victorian ambiance that Hammer is known for, plus you can’t go wrong with Cushing and Lee. Meanwhile Marla Landi is sharp & spirited in the feminine department while winsome Judi Moyens is notable in a brief opening role.

If you like Hammer and the principles, it’s enjoyable to some degree, but there’s good reason it’s so obscure in the Hammer canon. It’s just not that compelling; the well-done opening is the best part.

11791,"André Morrell takes a more serious approach to his characterisation of ""Dr. Watson"" than Nigel Bruce did in his series of ""Sherlock Holmes"" stories with Basil Rathbone, and coupled with Peter Cushing as the fastidious super-sleuth, manages to create quite a solid drama here that mixes the scientific with the superstitious entertainingly. The detecting duo are recruited by the suspicious ""Dr. Mortimer"" (Francis De Wolff) following the death of the wealthy ""Sir Charles Baskerville"". His heir has arrived from South Africa and his new neighbour has fears for his safety. ""Sir Henry"" (Christopher Lee) heads to his remote Dartmoor estate where the creepy mire, dense fog, escaped convicts and lamps flashing in the distance create quite a menacing scene for the new owner of this near £1 million property. Though Lee's character proves largely peripheral, he does enough and the rest of the supporting cast - especially Miles Malleson's sherry-swilling bishop and John Le Mesurier as the butler - work well together, as does the James Bernard score, in augmenting the more traditional Hammer, slightly Gothic, look of the film.

11797,"Feeling like a time warp now, but oh so much fun and frights.

Viewing this for the first time in 20 years really put a smile on my face, now I know that for after having just watched a horror film that may not be the best guideline you will ever read, but the film has it's tongue firmly in cheek and it doesn't come up short on the thrill factor.

You will read other reviews stating that the film is a little cheesy and a little dated, and sure, in this day and age of gorno and ultimate slash kill death murder movies, the film can be judged as tame alongside the big box office ghoul movies. But from a personal point of view I got such a kick out of watching a good honest genre piece that shows love, care, and entertainment rolled into one movie. Perhaps I'm the old fart who is so desensitised to blood horror these days? Perhaps I live in the past too much? So what? It matters not because as long as there are delightful genre pieces like this to remind me that the 80s horror crowd had some knowing style, then I'm a happy bunny.

Cute teens embroiled in Vampire next door plot is about the make up of the film. No one believes the central guy of the piece (William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster), but he convinces TV Vampire Slayer Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) to join his quest to rid the neighbourhood of the murdering menace living next door. The film has the love interest in peril (Amanda Bearse), it has the grossly annoying best friend (Stephen Geoffreys) - and boy is he annoying! And it has all the homages to the horror classics gone by you could wish to have.

Such guts and gusto went into making this film I felt like clapping at the end. It's aware of the horror competition when you catch some of the dialogue, so it should never be allowed to become a perceived cheesy relic, because this is 1985 and it rocks for those that remember when horror had a glint in its eye instead of a sabre through its head. 8/10",8.0

Watching Keaton as he unconvincingly stares at televised white noise for an hour and a half, which is essentially nothing, perfectly surmises the experience of Sax' supposedly supernatural horror. However, the biggest crime that the studio committed was releasing the feature on the first weekend of the year. Now, it's common knowledge that the initial start to the cinematic year typically begins with a disposable horror. Well, White Noise is to blame. Signalling untapped box office potential, despite the overt opinions of critics. And, as to be expected, matches the quality of a broken tape. A successful architect loses his wife to a drowning accident, to which he then encounters a psychic introducing him to the supernatural phenomenon of EVP.

Electronic Voice Phenomena. Y'know, recording background noise in a room, playing back the tape and flabbergasted when the ghost of ‪Michael Jackson‬ hauntingly sings ""Thriller"". Except in White Noise the tool that's used is, well, white noise. The annoyingly hypnotising static from televisions when no channel is picked up from the current frequency. Keaton becomes entranced by the ominous voices and high definition faces he sees within the six televisions he owns in his modern apartment. Who is making contact? Is it his wife? Malevolent entities trapped in the cubic prison that is a television? Pretty sure writer Johnson didn't even know himself.

The film is a mess. It's muddled, confused and abhorrently remains stagnant throughout. This architect, a father, essentially abandons his son when fixated on saving souls warned by his deceased wife that conveniently match the images in the white noise as soon as he arrives to any given scenario, despite ""Willow Avenue"" being mentioned days before. So think of it as 'Final Destination' meets 'Pulse' (original, obviously...). Except it's neither as entertaining as the former nor as horrifying as the latter.

Keaton looked bored as hell and overacted in times of emotional distress, although reassured the narrative with control. The jump scares were obnoxiously tame, yet admittedly one of the piercing noises made me twitch my body. The ending is...well, let's just not talk about it. It's terrible, with CGI ghost things swooping in on Batman, and answers no lingering questions that the mystery of EVP conjured up. Heck, the feature begins and concludes with onscreen text about ""existing"" occurrences. ""1 in 12 cases are dangerous"". Yeah. Ok. You know what is dangerous? Ruining Keaton's career. We had to wait a decade later for his rejuvenation!

11808,"***Pedestrian, but competent, sequel to “The Fugitive”***

Released in 1998, “U.S. Marshals” is the sequel to the 1993 hit “The Fugitive.” Tommy Lee Jones returns as Federal Marshal Samuel Gerard. He & his team hunt down an escaped prisoner named Sheridan (Wesley Snipes) from wilderness regions to the streets of New York City. Robert Downey Jr. is on hand as a Defense Security Service agent who assists the marshals.

This sequel makes you realize just how well-done “The Fugitive” is. It features the same basic plot, but without most of the magic. The first act with the plane crash & swamp sequence is decent but it doesn’t hold a candle to bus crash/train wreck & dam sequence of the prior flick. Snipes is effective, but his character doesn’t evoke the sympathy of Kimble (Ford) because for most of the movie we don’t know if he’s innocent or not.

Nevertheless, if you’re in the mood for a movie cut from the same cloth as “The Fugitive,” “Enemy of the State” (1998) and “Con Air” (1997) then “U.S. Marshals” should fill the bill, but it’s the least of these. I’d put it on par with “Patriot Games” (1992) and “Money Train” (1995).

The Fly is directed by Kurt Neumann and adapted to screenplay by James Clavell from the short story written by George Langelaan. It stars David Hedison, Patricia Owens, Vincent Price, Herbert Marshall, Kathleen Freeman and Betty Lou Gerson. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by Karl Struss.  

When science goes berserk, The Fly finds Hedison as scientist Andre Delambre, who after successfully inventing the ability to transmit matter from one place to another - falls prey to a cruel slice of horrific fate...

Kurt Neumann would sadly pass away shortly after The Fly was released. Itself a terrible shame, it's doubly sad that he didn't get to see his film become a cult favourite with longevity assured. It's a film that smartly blends sci-fi with horror, and even managing to be fun into the bargain. 

It's sometimes by modern observers accused of being too slow, but really it's a lesson in fine story telling. For at the heart of the tragic tale is a bountiful love story, the loyalty of a great wife in full effect. Throw in Andre's stoic pursuit of a science to benefit mankind, and this is a film that needs time to lay the story foundations.

Once we get to the horrors, and the surviving characters of the flashback structure play out this fateful tale, it simultaneously grips and fascinates. The effects work of course now looks a bit creaky, but those who first sampled them many decades ago have never ever forgotten the impact of the critical sequences.

Two pretty poor sequels would follow, which in turn would see a brilliant remake by David Cronenberg some 28 years later. Neumann's film is still a great piece of 1950s sci-fi, clinically adapted from a genius piece of short story writing. Loop holes exist, of course, but who cares, dive in and be haunted by what transpires on the screen. 8/10",8.0

This was actually Fox’s first theatrical film, made BEFORE the mega-successful “Back to the Future” but released afterward.

In the fifth film in the “Police Academy” franchise, we follow the characters that everyone already knows on a trip to Miami for a national police convention where veteran Commander Lassard, about to retire and leave the command of the academy, will be rewarded. The script is decent enough, but we can't ignore that, after four films, the comic material is worn out and doesn't make us laugh like it used to. The production's solution was to change location, which was not as effective as one might think: in other films we had already had lots of beach jokes.

The film retains many familiar faces from everyone who has seen the previous films. However, it was unable to bring together the entire cast, not counting Steve Guttenberg, Tim Kazurinsky and Bob Goldthwait, actors who chose not to be part of this project and who had their relevance (especially Guttenberg) in the previous films. As a direct consequence, the film pays more attention to actors who had remained in the shadows, such as Bubba Smith, who performs well here. Michael Winslow, Leslie Easterbrook, George Graf and Marion Ramsey are also present in this film, but they limit themselves to doing more than they had before, and their collaboration is nothing new. George Gaynes also has more protagonism here, and the actor exploited it very well, but it is the duo formed by Lance Kinsey and G. W. Bailey that makes us laugh and steals all the attention thanks to their mischief. Matt McCoy was particularly weak and doesn't deserve to continue in the franchise.

Technically, the film retains many aspects of the previous films in the franchise, such as the costumes, cinematography and effects. It takes advantage of the aerial scenes and landscapes of Miami, with its hotels and wetlands, but I got the feeling that the location was chosen to allow as many girls in bikinis as possible. The settings are decent, although sometimes there are problems (that plane door that is easily ripped off and proves to be light is, of course, fake). The film is not long, wastes no time and was well edited, but the final scene in the swamp is disappointing: I think it was the third time that a “Police Academy” film ended with a random chase, and what was done here it is virtually a copy of a similar scene in another film in the franchise.",2.0

The story is very thin, very film noir, an ex bad boy doing one last job that risks everything he has settled down for, but there's a panache to how the makers construct the tale. It helps that it's boosted by a ferocious performance from Kingsley, who is given licence to unleash his dark half, as he swears, stares, gets violent and has a general disregard for anyone but himself. 

Director Glazer, in what was his film after breaking out from advertisements and music videos, shows a keen eye for stylist visuals and attention grabbing scenes. He opens with an outrageous sequence of Gal sun bathing by his pool, the sun burning down, and then a giant boulder thunders into view and lands in the pool! All set to the sound of ""The Stranglers"" single ""Peaches"". Quite a way to announce yourself in film. 

The first half of film is the best, set at Gal's Spanish villa, Glazer neatly frames the characters (Gal lives with his wife and his two friends from England live nearby) as they bicker and cower in the shadow of Logan, who wouldn't be beyond sending them all to hell if he doesn't get his way. It's sweaty and tense, a coiled spring like atmosphere tells us something is going to give - and it does. The second half of the piece is not so tense or thrilling, though the robbery has a whiff of genius about it, but the pay off works well because Gal has earned our respect, as has his fellow sun seekers. Sexy Beast is not just sexy (tongue in cheeks for the makers), it's beefy and brutal, but also strangely beautiful as well. Nice. 8/10",8.0
11826,"The other day, my lady Tammy and I watched director Glazer's recent 'Under the Skin' and loved its otherworldly wackiness and ambience, and as I had his first two films on DVD, we decided that at the very least, this first one demanded immediate investigation. I've adored Ray Winstone's work since his early days working in the films of Sir Alan Clarke, and Ben Kingsley's always a treat. Watching the characters brought back such awesome memories of my teenage days, travelling throughout England and continental Europe in December, 1986, as well. We can't wait to hopefully check out 'Birth' later this week...This was definitely one of the best and most original British gangster movies since the likes of 'The Long Good Friday' and 'Mona Lisa' from that era...",9.0
11826,"Ben Kingsley is great in this ultimate comedy heist movie. He is sent to wrest ""Gal"" (Ray Winstone) and his wife ""Deedee"" (Amanda Redmnan) from their well earned retirement (from the criminal fraternity) in Spain. Initially, they want nothing to do with ""Logan"" and his scheme, but a series of almost surreal events and a negotiation that can really only be describe as unique (and vaguely devilish) soon have them reunited with ""Teddy"" (Ian McShane) and plotting away merrily. Meantime, ""Gal"" is having some really curious dreams - and he is soon struggling to differentiate between reality and his vibrant and menacing visions. The standard thread of the story isn't much to write about, but the characterisations do make a difference here. The usually wooden Winstone works really well contrasting his hard-nosed criminal with his almost sentimental love for his wife and family. She, an erstwhile ""adult entertainer"" proves just as robust as him and even the unremarkable McShane has something about him that reminded me of why he was ever a charismatic success in ""Lovejoy"" in the first place. The plaudits do, however, go to Kingsley. Aided by a humorous and pithy script, he delivers the frankly monstrous and obnoxious character with his tongue in his cheek and a thinly veiled threat never far from his lips. I loved the last twenty minutes or so as the thing comes to an head and with plenty of twisting and writhing going on, it's anything but predictable. None of my favourite acting talent here, but hats off to Jonathan Glazer for pulling off a clever and sophisticated, yet rough and potent drama.",7.0
11827,"I know this has an incredible fan base and considered a cult classic but as someone who never watched this I don't have any nostalgia feelings for this. I found some of the animation to be pretty good while others, like for the segment, ""Harry Canyon"", I didn't care very much for (although it was my favorite one of the bunch, reminded me of The Fifth Element). The rest was watchable but not terribly impressive and the last, ""Taarna"" had good visuals but at that point I really was not invested.

I don't know, maybe if I had watched this at some point in the late 80s or early 90s, it would have a better connection with my, but I was more interested as it is, not sure I have much interest in revisiting. **3.0/5**",6.0

That is until ""Gorô"" (Tsutomu Yamazaki) and his young sidekick ""Gun"" (Ken Watanabe) arrive and decide they are going to help her realise her dream to improve her shop. Her emporium also serves as the lynch pin for a few tangential stories that focus around her customers and their need for food - and not only for nourishment, either! My favourite has to be the old woman who insists of squishing the life out of his produce then not buying anything - much to the chagrin of the poor shopkeeper. There is also quite a fun tale of an housewife on her deathbed who rises, just before the end, to cook her family a delicious dinner; and of a gangster - clad in a white suit, who finds quite an erotic way to use his dinner, too. It is funny and quirky, this film, with some really engaging performances and the two hours it takes just flies by.",7.0

A timely intervention from the US Navy rescued some of the crew, but then subjected the erstwhile cargo to an humiliating and debase battle for their ""ownership"". Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) takes up the cudgels on their behalf - at no small risk to himself, and with the assistance of former US President John Quincy Adams (Sir Anthony Hopkins) takes this principle all the way to the Supreme Court. It is most bizarre to watch this and even begin to contemplate a society in which the concept of one person, business, or nation claiming the possession of a human being is actually being discussed by rational people in a court of law, but here we have it. The film looks great, plenty of attention to the detail with the costumes and the sets but there is far too much incidental dialogue and the pace of the story seems more intent of delivering a story of epic length rather than meaningful drama. Sir Anthony delivers well in the last fifteen minutes with a most potent piece of oratory; this is probably the best effort we have yet seen from McConaughey and there are strong supporting roles from Sir Nigel Hawthorne (Van Buren); an impressive Djimon Hounsou - who has no English dialogue - as the leader of the incarcerated and Morgan Freeman also delivers well as he tries to facilitate the freedom and potential repatriation of these people back to modern day Sierra Leone. The moral and ethical issues here are writ large and presented in a well crafted, poignant and sometimes quite brutal fashion that make this a decent, if not great, film to watch.",7.0
11832,"Based on a Karen Blixen story, <i>Babette's Feast</i> is a heartwarming tale of generosity in 19th century Denmark. As the film opens, we are introduced to Martine and Philippa, daughters of a charismatic preacher in a tiny Jutland village. Dedicated to their father's work, they turn down the courtship of a Danish officer and a French musician. Decades later, the musician sends them Babette, a refugee from the destruction of the Paris Commune, in the hope that the sisters can shelter her and employ her as a maid. When she wins an annual lottery, Babette decides to put on a feast for her employers, but no one expects the depths of selflessness she goes to.

<i>Babette's Feast</i> is entertaining enough, and it gives an idea of just how dull and messy life in Jutland was at this time. The details of the feast will make you salivate and dust off the French cookbook, and certainly the ending will make you say ""Aww"" in spite of how clumsily it's put on film. Otherwise the acting isn't too revelatory, and the humour is pretty basic (the same joke is even used twice). One professional reviewer said this doesn't aim much higher than a television movie, and I'd have to agree.",5.0
11832,"Well, <em>'Babette’s Feast'</em> is exactly what it says on the tin, that's for sure.

It is a film that I'd personally refer to as 'good', though my interest did ascend and descend interchangeably throughout. The religiously and sing-y scenes were the parts that kinda lost me if I'm honest, but there is still enough there that I had a fine time seeing unfold - the characters for one, and then the final feast itself is decent viewing.

Stéphane Audran is the best performer onscreen, I enjoyed her showing. The actresses that play Filippa and Martine, both younger and older, are solid. Beyond them, the rest of the cast all kinda merge into one in my memory as being alright. It's very much all about Audran, I'd say.

I do like how the film unfolds and what it has to end up saying, there is charm in there. I just personally would've had it move along at a slightly quicker pace because this does drag a tiny bit in parts; and that's despite it only being practically a 90 minute movie. Overall, though, it's a pass from me.",7.0
11832,"**_The moment when “Mercy and truth… have kissed each other”_**

In a northern Jutland village, two daughters of a pietistic Lutheran pastor are dutiful spinsters by 1871 (Bodil Kjer and Birgitte Federspiel) when they take-in a Parisian refugee who “can cook” (Stéphane Audran). Fourteen years later, the latter insists on banquet for the dwindling congregation and a Hussar general, a former suiter of one of the sisters from decades earlier (Jarl Kulle).

A Danish production, “Babette’s Feast” (1987) was based on the short story by Isak Dinesen, aka Karen Blixen, who’s also known as the author of “Out of Africa.” I point that out because this has the same quietly dramatic tone, just transplanted to a family of ascetic rural Protestants in 1800’s Denmark.

To enjoy this, you have to be in the mood for period drama along the lines of “Mysteries” (1978) or “Mayflower: The Pilgrims' Adventure” (1979). This is even more mundane and subtle than those, but it’s rich with underlying meaning, such as two opposing things meeting at the table of the true artist for respite, e.g. worldly disillusionment and stiff pietism, Protestant and Catholic, upper-class and lower-class, the experienced and the naïve, bickering congregant and fellow congregant, older self and younger self, etc.

I said the movie was subtle, and it is, that is until the third act when a couple of bits are laid on too thick. But, man, I loved the part about loving someone every day, decade after decade, even though you can’t physically be together for one reason or another.

It's at least 20 minutes overlong at 1 hour, 42 minutes. And was shot in Denmark with the village located at Vigsø, Thisted Kommune.

11834,"The biggest problem I have with this is that, well, it just isn't very funny! It centres on Michael Palin's ""Dennis Cooper"" - a man who determines that to win the hand of his true love ""Griselda"" (Annette Badland) he must enter the vile and filthy city of King ""Bruno the Questionable"" (Max Wall) and prove his worth with some magnificent deed of derring-do. The deed, well that is to rid the kingdom of a pesky dragon - ""the Jabberwocky"". Right from the get-go, the would be fairy tale romance is so implausible as to go from mildly amusing at first to downright irritating after about ten minutes. Thereafter, a cast of British theatrical stalwarts and comedians do try to keep this film vaguely entertaining, but the humour is just far too contrived and piecemeal. Palin works hard, but the exhaustion in having to stretch this thinnest of stories out for 1¾ hours is writ large on his face until, by the end, even he looks like he is thinking - ""Please, let's just get this over with"". ""Star Wars"" fans might spot ""Darth Vader"" himself and from a star-spotting perspective, there is some value in the film but otherwise it is a poorly conceived and executed attempt at a fantasy adventure and my money was always on the dragon!",5.0

The animation, for its time, is absolutely splendid - super effective! The music is also noteworthy. I will say that I don't think the characters are anything above solid, like post-watch I can't really remember any of them individually; visually at least, because the voice cast are very good.",8.0
11837,"The instantly recognisable tones of Sir Michael Hordern set the scene as he tells us a tale of yore about the rabbit. How it got it's white fluffy tail, it's strong hind legs and it's speed, sure, but also of it's vulnerabilities. It is the animal that most others just want to eat! Many generations later and a colony is struggling with overcrowding. Mankind is encroaching on it's territory and there simply isn't room in the warren anymore. ""Hazel"" suggests to the boss that they start a new one, but he flares up and refuses. Together with ""Fiver"" they go anyway but it's not long before they encounter the rather more militaristic one run by the menacing ""Woundwort"" who rules with claws and blood. I aways though their something Orwellian about Richard Adams's novel, and the selection of the sweet and docile bunny rabbit as the subject for this rather ferocious analysis of societal dysfunction adds even better to the anachronisms as even they prove to have a class system, an hierarchy and even their own furry version of a secret police! The animation is gorgeous to watch. The innocence and frivolity; the violence and the brutality - they are all captured quite graphically at times as the story unfolds. Art Garfunkel's song ""Bright Eyes"" doesn't actually feature so prominently as I'd remembered, but it does add quite potently for the few moments it's used to illustrate that which is tantalisingly close for ""Hazel"" and co. There's something truly fitting about a conclusion that seems righteous, even if it does rather reinforce the survival of the fittest mentality that these critters are trying to escape - with four legs or two.",7.0
11839,"Discretion is for fools and simpletons.

From the opening credits as Danny Kaye sings dressed as a harlequin jester you get the impression that this film will be a joyous romp, and so it is. Perhaps the most talked about film in Kaye's CV (even though it lost close to two million dollars on release), The Court Jester is a perfect vehicle for his blend of madcap showboating and serene warbling. Here he gets to play both the coward and the hero in a delightful dual role that is as energetic as it is mirthful - and thankfully  the supporting cast (Cecil Parker, Angela Lansbury and Basil Rathbone in particular) are clued into the nature of the film to bring about top entertaining results. Though to be fair, it would be ignorant of me to not point out that Glynis Johns' Maid Jean is under formed.

A number of hilarious sequences stand out in the film, from Hubert Hawkins transformation back and forth as Giacomo, to a brilliantly funny knighting ceremony, the film ticks all the boxes for fun family entertainment. Whilst do I need to mention ""the vessel with the pestle, the flagon with the dragon, and the chalice with the palace"" section of film that rightly stands the time for classic status. Great songs, great routines, Kaye on form, with Rathbone as the hissable villain, what more do you need? The Court Jester, a perfect movie for all the family. 8/10",8.0

11839,"Oh, this is a gem of celluloid that just keeps giving joy.  An adventure, comedy, romance, musical made for the whole family.

A movie written specifically for one actor (who then agrees to play the central part) doesnt happen often, let alone have that role portrayed with perfection....But Danny Kaye is that special kind of actor.  

A spoof of The Adventures Of Robin Hood that even managed to get its villain, the great Basil Rathbone (and its light-years ahead of Men In Tights).  This is an underrated masterpiece that I watch, laugh at and notice new things regularly.  It is one of those movies that can always lift your mood (or at the very least make you smile).  

The plot starts slowly and simply, becomes intricate, and weaves its medieval tapestry-like threads into a beautiful, neat picture at the end,  tying everything up (as all good musicals should). 

The dialogue is at a level that we miss in modern film.  And the timing of the lines is perfect from the classic chalice from the palace to the: 
“I’d like to get in, get on with it, get it over with, and get out. Get it?
“Got it.”
“Good.”
This film is endlessly quotable (in fact, the quotes page on IMDB is lengthy). 

Perfectly cast, Kaye is supported by Johns and Landsbury who glide across their scenes with grace and beauty, and Rathbone sneers and schemes his way through his limited screen time.

The swordplay in the final fight is glorious - up there with the best (the Princess Bride) in terms of skill and creativity. 

And the small gestures that the actors make through the movie, be they nudges, winks, kicks....the detail and timing here is outstanding and worthy of the greatest comedians in the business. 

What else - the costumes (perfectly completed by Edith Head) and sets are gorgeous. The colouring is stunning in a way that only a few films are.  And the music will keep you humming (and whistling) for ages after.  Hell, they even tried to make the credits interesting as Danny sings about the different roles involved in the making of the movie.  

My issues (and why its not 5 stars) - the pacing (it starts out very slow), the effects (rope swings, etc) and the ""march"" feel dated.  

But, I fell in love with this movie as a child (when my Mother introduced me to it).  It became a regular watch on video.  For me this has just gotten better as I get older, and like any long term loves, the issues fall aside.  One of my top 10 favourites of all time.",9.0

I would like to add that Shaolin (2011) is in the same caliber of this movie, but with modern cinematography techniques and beautiful dark forest coloring.

But the plans to overturn the evil general Tien Ta are discovered and a massacre follows - Liu Yude (played by), escapes and join the Shao Lin Temple to learn the martial arts in 7 years and returns now, as Monk San Te to confront and crush the oppressive regime, while coming out as the Master of the 36th chamber, created by him to enlist new followers. 

The great thing about this movie is the training sequences that make up for 75% of the movie, through them Liu becomes a Master of the arts by full determination and learns self-discipline. Formulaic as every other Kung Fu movie of the 70's the training steps differentiate this from other movies. 

Quite good Kung Fu scenes on the right time (nothing rushed) and beautiful choreography. The negative spots can be named as the blood (common red ink by the way) and the number of scenes filmed on studio - if their where done in the open the movie could be a lot better than it is.

His work with these monks is a bit ignominious - a seemingly perpetual job sweeping leaves and keeping their monastery tidy, but a chance meeting with the sagely Abbot gives him a change to learn. Rather arrogantly he opts for the 35th level - and is soon taught one of the core values of their order. Humility. Starting again from scratch and after a few duckings in the water en route to dinner, he quickly masters not just the martial skills, but also becomes imbued in the peaceful and honourable traditions of Buddhism. His spiritual leader is sympathetic to his true purpose, though, and soon he is foraying into the countryside to wreak havoc and revenge on those who destroyed his home and his family. This is a solid and entertaining revenge story with plenty of action and quite a considered look at just how cerebral a way many of these essentially self-defence techniques were designed to be employed. Yes, much of the combat action is extremely well choreographed and does frequently lack any sense of authenticity - except, perhaps, at the end of the story when a duel with nemesis ""General Tien Ta"" (Lieh Lo) showcases the nimbleness of the young man's newly acquired patience and dexterity. This is a well paced adventure that avoids the trap of endless, repetitive, fight scenes; it nods it's head to the codes of decency and tolerance that underpin the lives of the monks and their teachings - and still manages to find a novel use for a bowl of rice.",7.0

Gradually, the two men (and their cultures) begin to bond and it is soon clear that both men have a grudge against ""Gauche"". This beef leads them to the brothel of his gal ""Cristina"" (Ursula Andress) and to a series of frequently quite entertaining combat scenes that allow Mifune to demonstrate his classy - though not always suitable - sword skills and associated flummery. There's quite a fun dynamic between the two principals here, but the film itself is a bit long, slow and it has something of the downbeat spaghetti western to it (Maurice Jarre not Ennio Morricone this time, though).

Plummer isn't really on screen enough to make much difference and Schell looks more like she's really wondering why she's not beck in a ""Bond"" movie.

The ""Old Major"" calls a meeting to organise a plan of action, but he goes off to the big sty in the sky (not that Orwell would have believed in such a place) and that leaves ""Snowball"" in charge and they decide to quite entertainingly depose the useless farmer and do things by themselves. They even have their own form of constitution declaring equality, fraternity and - one may not eat the other, nor sleep in a bed! Their Elysian scenario prevails for a while but soon another insurrection looms in the form of ""Napoleon"" who sees their leader as weak and ineffectual. A coup ensues and gradually we see the emergence of a first amongst equals policy, then rules are arbitrarily altered, ostensibly for the good of the community then, yep - we are back with an overt dictatorship that spawns ideas of a little revolution now and again is a good thing. There are obvious parallels here with the decline of Imperial Russia (or even Bourbon France) being followed by a series of increasingly less benign dictators, and of the ultimate realisation that when you give people power, they will always want more. The animation uses the different animals to show strength - of body and/or will, well and the narration serves as a gentle tramline for what we can all see is the writing in the sand.

11849,"Campy, amusing heroic fantasy with – you guessed it – dungeons and dragons.

RELEASED IN 2000 and directed by Courtney Solomon, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" chronicles events in the kingdom of Izmer where the idealistic Empress (Thora Birch) advocates equality between the mages and commoners while the power-mad Profion (Jeremy Irons) plots to overthrow the Empress with the help of his formidable henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne). A ragtag team is assembled to save Izmer by apprehending the Eye of the Dragon: Two thieves (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans), a beautiful mage apprentice (Zoe McLellan), a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and an elf girl (Kristen Wilson).  
 
The first shot with Irons hamming it up as the diabolical Profion made me bust out laughing. In other words, the movie telegraphs from the get-go that it’s not to be taken seriously. If you can roll with the campiness, this is an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of “Star Wars” (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and you’d have a good idea of what “Dungeons & Dragons” has to offer. 

This was a theatrical release that cost a whopping $45 million, but totally bombed at the box office. The 2005 sequel “Wrath of the Dragon God” (with only Bruce Payne returning as Damodar) cost just $15 million and is slightly better because the creators took the material seriously, but it’s decidedly TV fantasy fare.

The film scores pretty well on the female front with the winsome McLellan and cutie Birch. Whalin and Wayans are entertaining as the two main protagonists, if you can get past their goofiness. People love to hate Snails (Wayans), but I found him to be a likable, amusing character.

It's poor, this - but I didn't hate it. There is a bit of fun being had, Whalin is easy enough on the eye and the whole thing has it's tongue so firmly planted in it's cheek that it is hard to actually dislike it - especially at the end when Iron hits super-ham mode and the dragons all take flight.

11850,"When San Francisco is invaded by pod-people  

RELEASED IN 1978 and directed by Philip Kaufman, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" stars Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams as friends, Matthew and Elizabeth, who work at the Health Department in San Francisco. They increasingly suspect that people are somehow being duplicated and trace the problem to alien plant pods. Leonard Nimoy plays Matthew’s pop psychologist friend while Jeff Goldblum & Veronica Cartwright are on hand as a couple who run a mudbath parlour.

This could be viewed as a sequel rather than a remake. The entries in the series are as follows: ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956); ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1978); ""Body Snatchers"" (1993); and ""The Invasion"" (2007).

The first one is in Black & White and is probably too dated and tame for most modern viewers, but it's still worthwhile; it takes place in small town, California. This 1978 sequel switches the setting to the big city. The 1993 movie shifts to an army base in the deep south while the 2007 version switches back to the big city of Washington DC.

This rendition has a peculiar tone with a lot of the events taking place at night. There’s a subdued eerie and dreary air with paranoia morphing into conspiratorial and then ghastly reality. The 70’s atmosphere and cast are highlights, as is the score with its unnerving pieces. Brooke Adam’s has exquisitely sculptured facial features (eyes, nose, lips, teeth, chin, cheeks and forehead). The creepy pod-birthing sequence in the garden is cogently done.

11851,"Mark Harmon is ""Jay"", a former military policeman turned cop who is called upon to investigate a series of murders that reintroduce him to his former CO ""Col. Caldwell"" (Sean Connery) with whom he doesn't especially get along. It doesn't help when he starts to date the colonel's independently minded daughter ""Donna"" (Meg Ryan) but can they put their differences aside long enough to find out what's going on and stop any more killings? Well, of course they can - this film has precisely no jeopardy at all. Though the motive for the crimes remains a mystery for a while, the rest of this follows a well travelled line that is disappointingly predictable. Harmon is never a particularly strong or convincing actor, Connery - and his traditional, wry, smile - clearly just wanted his fee and not for the first time Meg Ryan adds very little as this plods along. It's watchable on the television over a glass or two, but it's all very unremarkable.",5.0
11851,"Occasionally my mother would really get into a movie, choose a quote as a favorite, and then repeat it constantly in a cartoonish exaggeration of whoever said it in the film.

The Persidio is one of those films she latched onto, and for years after we were subjected to her Sean Connery impression as she threatened to beat us up using only her thumb.

So now every time I see it, heck, every time I'm in Frisco, that is the quote that gets stuck in my head for days after. But, in her defense, it was a very good scene and actually does deserve to be remembered and quoted more.

It's my go to Sean Connery impression... when I'm not impersonating Johnny Lee Miller impersonating Sean Connery. Or the Untouchables, but I kind of feel that one is over used. Everyone goes there when they do Connery. Or, you know, I could just live in Chicago. Maybe the rest of the country and the world just does James Bond.

The point is, you have a quotable Sean Connery scene. And that alone is worth it.

And you have the San Francisco chase scene, and I really hate Frisco, but I do really love movies that are set there and any chase through San Francisco streets is fun if for no other reason than it makes you instantly think of Bullet.

The multi-jurisdictional cliche thing is here, and tragically underused in a lot of movies. But you get a good dynamic of military and civilian cop bumping heads with one another. It's a situation that is made worse by bad blood and a bit of history, and then made even worse by a blooming romantic interest.

And it's the 80s, so you know that the romantic interest is going to be Meg Ryan, no spoiler there.

And all of that with an actual compelling case that the two cops have to solve.

It's kind of all over the place, but in the best possible 80s cliche kind of way.",10.0
11851,"""The Presidio"" is an interesting diversion that has an immediately intriguing and literally explosive opening gambit which is eye catching and it easily grabs your full attention, but then the pace quickly eases up out of pure necessity and the murder of Patti Jean Lynch loses all sense of urgency and it is eventually relegated to becoming a secondary consideration as the main focus of the film now concentrates upon the complex and argumentative character dynamics of Lieutenant Colonel Caldwell, his daughter Donna, and Inspector Jay Austin although all of this is nicely juxtaposed with the ongoing murder investigation. However, this film is much too pedestrian for the talented cast involved, but at least the action sequences are superb and the pace is extremely well maintained throughout.",5.0
11852,"Decent watch, might watch again, but I don't think I can whole-heartedly recommend it.

This ""body swap"" trope is dealing with both sex swapping and age swapping, but not parent-child swapping, so a lot of things come with that in this silly dirt comedy.  I'm not even sure you could make this movie in 2020, there would be too much heat from online communities.  Just a ""30 year old man"" hanging around high schoolers, let alone young women, let alone young women that attract attention like these rich little brats do.

The writing is a lot of plot convenience, not only do they not immediately end up in jail, there are neglectful parents, school faculty, and far too many people to know about the situation and believe it.  With the ratio of people that accept it, she could just live openly as a ""girl in a mans body"".

I do enjoy that the medium in this version is a pair of earrings, they make sense and keep you from thinking about it for too long.

Weirdly, they do manage to shift focus by writing in weird distractions all over the place, and it surprisingly helps with transitions:  Adam Sandler a a fake rastafarian (I think at one point they agreed to always play racist roles in each others movies), a weird, but positive, racial identity plot, and even a dance club sequence that felt rather unecessary.

Now the point is that it's a comedy, and it should be funny, and it is, at times, but using potentially serious issues as comedy really distracts from the ""I'm just having a good time"" of it all, even when it's legitimately funny.

It's not that it's all bad, or that I don't like it, or like I won't watch it again, eventually, but there are a lot of movies to watch, and no one is missing anything from skipping this one.",6.0
11853,"Gunslingerettes line up for the atrocity exhibition.

Bad Girls is directed by Jonathan Kaplan from a screenplay by Ken Friedman and Yolande Turner. It stars Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson, Andie MacDowell and Drew Barrymore. The plot sees the four girl actors playing prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and a hanging escape. Suffice to say that they get into scrapes & double crosses whilst being pursued by the Pinkertons.

Being asked to suspend disbelief is one thing, being force fed drivel masquerading as pro-feminism is entirely another. Bad Girls is a mess of a movie, an insult to the Western genre, to the fans of the lady actors, to the lady actors themselves, who simply deserve much much better and arguably worst of all - to women in general. The script is laughable, serving only as an excuse for the gals to sling those guns and hips when possible, whilst being abused and saved by ""men"", while the plotting is by the numbers as everything falls into place readily. There's even slow-mo shots where they serve no purpose of enhancement. Throw into the mix that three of the ladies look nothing like on the run outlaws, all shine and span and make up with nice hair (Masterson the exception as she has a modicum of believability about her), well it's rather a depressing experience all told. Sure, as a red blooded guy I'm not going to be turned off by Barrymore's shapely thighs adorned in white stockings, or Stowe's truly gorgeous face, but when the highlights of a ""girl"" Western is something that's only aesthetically sexy for men, then they clearly have got it wrong.

So what's the justification for it being so bad? Well the back story offers up the answer. Film was meant to be directed by a woman, Tamra Davis (erm-Billy Madison & Crossroads), but she was jettisoned a couple of weeks into production. The plan with Davis at the helm was for it to be a Western told from a female point of view. However, Kaplan (The Accused/Unlawful Entry) was brought in quickly and the screenplay rewritten in a hurry. And boy does it show. Technically it's a duffer too, Jerry Goldsmith's score is cheap in texture and Jane Kurson's editing is choppy to say the least. There's no eye catching cinematography (Ralf D. Bode), while the acting away from the script hindered girls (ie: the men), is either a waste of time them being in it (Nick Chinlund) or badly directed (James Russo). While Dermot Mulroney seems only to exist as being a link to Young Guns - the ""boy"" version that this is clearly trying to ride the coat tails in on. If you want a good Western about the girls fighting the good fight then seek out George Marshall's 1957 film The Guns Of Fort Petticoat. It's a fun movie that at least has believable women fighting back under duress. Bad Girls, tho, is just bad in every department. 2/10",2.0
11853,"_**Not so bad cowgirls**_

In 1891, four prostitutes in Echo City, Colorado (Madeleine Stowe, Andie MacDowell, Mary Stuart Masterson and Drew Barrymore), flee the law with Pinkertons hot on their trail. Eventually they have to tangle with a band of Hispanic outlaws to retrieve some money.

""Bad Girls"" (1994) is a Western with cowgirls as the protagonists rather than cowboys. It combines the tone of ""Silverado"" (1985) and the later “The Mask of Zorro” (1998) so anyone who likes those flicks will probably like this one even if it’s arguably the least of ’em.

The Western staples are checked with a saloon brouhaha, a lynch mob, a posse, Pinkerton detectives, a swimmin' hole scene, steam locomotives, a handsome hero (Dermot Mulroney), magnificent Western vistas, a bank robbery, a mirthful Latino bandit (James Russo) and the four heroes grimly walking side-by-side to the showdown. Yet there are a few original elements as well if you look closely.

While all four of the stars are beautiful in their unique way, young Drew stands out and is just stunning. Speaking of the females, occupations & freedom were limited to women in the Old West, and the movie effectively drives this home. 

People usually cite the available professions as marriage, school-marming, prostitution and old biddy-hood. But what about clerking of one manner or another? What about entertainment, like at local saloons, traveling troupes and Old West Shows? What about writing, like Harriet Beecher Stowe? What about ranch-owning? In other words, there were more options, but women had to use their imagination and take a bold step. The four heroines in “Bad Girls” are up to the task.

Like the two Westerns noted above, this one takes the larger-than-life, mythmaking approach rather than shoot for anything very believable. If you can roll with that, it fills the bill, just not as well as “The Mask of Zorro” or “American Outlaws” (2001).

The opening act wrongly paints the Christians marching in Echo City as enemies when, in real life, they would be the very people trying to help the protagonists out of the miserable bondage of prostitution, which all four wanted free from in the first place. While I understand people’s issues with life-stifling legalists, depicting the trampling of the Bible is gross ignorance. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot at Alamo Village, Brackettville, Texas , and nearby Del Rio, as well as Red Hills Ranch, Sonora, California, and nearby Sierra Railroad, Jamestown.

11856,"When ""Billy"" (Robert Downey Jr.) loses his pilot's licence after a lively misdemeanour, he finds himself working in war-torn Laos with the team at ""Air America"". This is a CIA-backed operation consisting of a disparate bunch of pilots whose job it is to fly in supplies to local villages. It's there that he meets ""Gene"" (Mel Gibson) and also where he realises that not only is it pretty dangerous out there, but that his paymasters are into the narcotics trade in quite a big way and, to make matters even more dodgy - one of his colleagues goes in for some illicit gun-running too. It does move along quickly enough, but the whole thing has a rather comic book feel to it. The writing is poor, the themes repeat themselves once too often and there is little chemistry from anyone on screen as the adventures rather lamely bumble along accompanied by a medicare AOR-style soundtrack. To be fair, it looks like Gibson is having some fun and it's always nice to see Burt Kwouk demonstrating just how little versatility he had as an actor - always looking perplexed, but otherwise all this is missing is Charlie Sheen.",6.0
11856,"I have a special love for this film, if for no other reason that the bulk of my college experience was spent on the cold war, the alphabet soup of PBSUCCESS, MKULTRA, JMWAVE, PAPERCLIP, COLDFEET, MKOFTEN, The Phoenix Program, ARTICHOKE, and my favorite (just because of how bad it sounds) Midnight Climax.

So a comedy about Air America was absolutely priceless. And, given that I am not one of those history nuts that cares about historical accuracy I can still sit back and enjoy something like this. I mean, honestly, so long as it's not a complete and total re-write... Hollywood can take it's liberties and edit what happened for drama, because, really, it just means that now people have heard of Air America.

And, honestly, when you choose to study the Cold War, people tend to think you're a conspiracy nut when you mention things like this, PBSUCCESS, Russians assassinating people with radiation poisoning and umbrella guns...

... So when something like this comes along, it's like yes... now people won't think I'm as crazy as Alex Jones.

And, you know, it features a song from the Seeds (and any real punk fan is going to drool over that) along with one of the better, if down played, soundtracks from the Vietnam Era. So it certainly has the music win.

And it's Gibson kind of hamming it up and doing a slightly saner version of his Lethal Weapon self... if oddly pacifistic. And RDJR, fresh out of rehab, proving to the world that he is actually capable of being a great actor when he is sober.

What you have is kind of an action movie without a lot of violence, set in the middle of a war zone, and based off of one of our intelligence black eyes in a way that doesn't take it too seriously, isn't heavy-handed or pretentious, masks any preachiness in a fun story, and really gets the point across without having to be Alan Alda at his worst.

Plus, it's a movie about skullduggery that doesn't resort to the Mission:Impossible/James Bond high action tropes. So, in a way, it's kind of a spy movie done right and... turned into a comedy.",10.0
11859,"Although panned by most critics, Fair Game (1995) is not nearly as bad as some would lead you to believe... especially if it's taken purely at face value. Based on the novel of the same name by Paula Gosling, the story had previously been filmed as Cobra (1986) starring Sylvester Stallone. For all intents and purposes, Fair Game is a decent action movie, although overindulgent in most aspects (huge explosions, gratuitous boob shots of Cindy Crawford, nudity, a famous sex scene and one-note acting). The film was designed solely as a vehicle to capitalize on the enormous popularity of Cindy Crawford, the hottest Supermodel of the 1990's... and in that respect, it had enormous success. Fair Game has become a sort of Cult classic, based on the adoration for Crawford's sex appeal and a brief, early role by Salma Hayek. As far as her bad acting goes, Cindy Crawford said it best, taking the high road with ""Oh well, at least I tried."" Indeed, she deserves an ""A"" for effort.",6.0
11860,"**A completely dispensable remake, for many of the qualities it may have, and which it does!**

Firstly, allow me to say that I am not one of those who think that there can or should be untouchable films, which due to their value or relevance should never be subject to revisits or remakes. “Sabrina”, the original film starring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, is a renowned classic and its place will never be in question. However, after seeing this modern remake, I can't help but feel that it was unnecessary. Despite being a good film, it can't be better than the original, it isn't the slightest bit different, and it wasn't able to update the original story. I really don't know where Sidney Pollack was able to think this was a good idea.

The story of this film, as well as a large amount of the dialogue, are copied from the original onto carbon paper, with almost no essential modifications. In fact, the most striking phrases of the dialogues are all there, the situations are the same. Where the film tries to be better is, essentially, in the high production values and the updating of a series of details without great relevance. For example, young Sabrina no longer goes to Paris to become a chef, but to work as an assistant at “Vogue” magazine. And of course, the sets, the filming locations, the props, everything takes us back to contemporary times and is done with the utmost good taste, from the choice of the mansion to the Larrabee corporate headquarters. And given that Pollack is a renowned and highly prestigious director, it's no surprise that the cinematography and soundtrack are also excellent: he was able to find the best. For example, the soundtrack is written by John Williams and, although it is not a remarkable work by the composer, it still has the quality he has accustomed us to.

As for the cast, Pollack also bet on great actors, with solid credits and a solid career in the seventh art. The three main protagonists are Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear, and the latter is perhaps the director's riskiest bet. Ormond and Ford give us, each in their own way, solid and consistent interpretations. However, if in the original film the huge age difference between Bogart and Hepburn was barely noticeable, this was glaring here, and it is extremely bizarre to see Ormond flirting with a man who appears to be her father. And with an aggravating factor: Ford is not, and has never been, an actor particularly suited to romantic plots, it is not a comfortable terrain for him. As a result, Ford and Ormond's romantic chemistry resembles a wall between them. Greg Kinnear does what he can, but doesn't have the strong charisma that is necessary for playboy David. The film also features contributions from John Wood, Nancy Marchand, Lauren Holly and Paul Giamatti.",5.0
11863,"Well, this is trying to be an erotic thriller and it is trying to be neo noir... and it doesn't pull off either.

It seems to be constantly confused about which way to go, never committing to either genre and not really merging them together very well. Which is pretty sad given that erotic thriller and Noir tend to mix nicely for the most part and can seemlessly transition.

11864,"**A very dated and unsatisfactory film, which carries a rather naive message about war and conflicts.**

This is one of those films that promises a lot when we read the synopsis, but ends up being disappointing: in its attempt to please different audiences, from sci-fi to drama and also action, it fails to satisfy anyone and I believe it was this feeling, more or less general, that led it straight to the oblivion bin where I found it.

Released in the golden age of sci-fi, when the genre experienced a very notable development and popularity, the film has a relatively warm story and begins with a war between humans and a reptilian alien species called “drac”. We follow the combat between two spaceships in a remote part of the universe until they both crash on the same planet. From here on, in order to survive, both will have to collaborate with each other, which opens the door to dialogue and mutual understanding.

I can understand what makes some people appreciate this film or want to see it: it has some good quality action that Wolfgang Petersen's solid direction emphasizes and enhances, and a script with a flowery and progressive message about prejudice and the importance of having a frank and open dialogue. That is, the film still comes in the aftermath of those ideas of peace and love from the 70s, where it seemed that all wars could end if there was a willingness to talk and understand whoever was on the opposite side.

However, neither the script nor the director are flawless: the film is excessively slow and has a variable and inconstant rhythm, we feel that it wastes time with a sentimentality worthy of a soap opera and injects a lot of melodrama without any advantage, like those people who stay for ten minutes talking before getting to what matters. With all this, the action, although good, is scarce and does not justify the film for fans of a good space fight. And the message of peace underlying the script forgets that all wars begin due to conflicts of interest, not exactly due to a lack of dialogue and mutual prejudices: I can understand my enemy very well and think that war is horrible, but decide to fight anyway if consider that I have a good chance of winning and, thus, have access to an advantage or gain that I would not be able to obtain otherwise.

Despite Dennis Quaid's sound and fame, the best actor in the film is Louis Gossett Jr., in an alien costume. The actor is not brilliant, he is average, but he manages to be incredible in the role, especially when he has an immature and charisma-free scoundrel like Quaid at his side. I've seen a few movies with him, and what he does here is essentially overact it and look stupid. Brion James deserves an honorable mention for the skillful villain he brought to life, but he adds little to the film.

Technically, it fits into the broad spectrum of mid-budget sci-fi films from the 80s: we have decent enough cinematography and some creatively invented aliens, to which must be added some good special effects. The general appearance is old: it is a visually very dated film and the sets and costumes, although effective, are unable to appear realistic. The sound isn't bad, but the soundtrack doesn't do much for the overall work.",3.0

It's a remake of the classic film about men in a hopeless situation when their small plane crashes in the desert. Hope comes back when one of the men reveals he can make an airplane, and the others believe him.
In such a story, the subplots and side stories make the story. Here, the subplots and side stories are cartoonish and contrived. The characters are totally without motivation. One can almost see the actors wince about being part of such a horribly written story.
In fact, one almost wonders if it was written for the purpose of some day being a ""so bad it's good"" story. I'm not sure. There really isn't any charm to this movie, no inspiration, no motivation, and that might be too bad to even make the ""so bad it's good"" list.",2.0

It falls to the survivors to work out a plan before the water runs out. Sadly, though, aside from the efforts from Giovanni Ribisi as designer ""Elliott"" (and that's because at times he resembles Hardy Kruger) the acting is pretty woeful. Dennis Quaid ought to be commended for taking on the Jimmy Stewart role - that was never going to be easy, but he just hasn't the screen presence. The rest of the ensemble form an unremarkable bunch and John Moore's direction does little to deliver any sense of peril or desperation as their predicament gets worse and their personal relationships become more and more fraught.

11868,"Sleep well, Mr. Harker.

The Curse of Frankenstein was coining it in at the box office, so Hammer Films were quick to negotiate a deal to reinvent Dracula on the big screen. Certain agreements were made as per distribution rights for Universal, who owned the rights via a deal that was struck decades earlier with the Bram Stoker estate. Once all the dots were dotted and the t's were crossed, Dracula hit the screens in a whirl of sensual Technicolor bliss, where the trajectory of horror film history was shunted upwards to the point that the legacy still lives on today.

Directed by Terence Fisher and adapted to screenplay by Jimmy Sangster, Dracula (AKA: Horror of Dracula) is a compact piece of horror. The Hammer team condense Stoker's novel down to an 80 minute film, quickly placing Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) at Castle Dracula and establishing the vampire legend courtesy of the slick and sexy Count Dracula himself (Christopher Lee). There's no changing into bats or scaling of walls here, in fact Dracula's dialogue is very minimalist, instead he permeates the film with sexual menace, horrific suggestion and an obvious disregard for humanity, with Lee in the role simply terrific.

Then it's time for Doctor Van Helsing to bring his cunning whiles to the party, which is the signal for Peter Cushing to enter the fray, who adds class and elegance to a classic role. James Bernard provides a dual score of erotic swirls and thunderous scares, while the cast play out the story in front of some impressively constructed Gothic sets, courtesy of Bernard Robinson, who like the rest of the team were working with a budget under six figures! Some nifty effects work cement the pic's status, other little touches - such as Dracula having no audible footsteps - also ensure that Hammer's Dracula remains a key vampire movie of note.

A number of interesting tid-bids sit in the film's back history. How it fell into the public domain, complaints about blood transfusion advertisements in theatre foyers during its first run! Censorship and the ""X"" Certification afforded it in the UK, and that some of the first wave of critic reviews were positively barbed and indignant. In truth Hammer would produce far better horror films post Dracula's release, in fact this is not even the best of the Hammer Dracula movies. Yet in the pantheon of Hammer film, and horror film in general, it's a 10/10 movie. Terence Fisher deserves the final word, he would say that the shoot and production for Dracula just clicked, it all worked and everyone was in sync. 8/10",8.0
11868,"Hammer’s first vampire flick with Christopher Lee as the Count.

RELEASED IN 1958 and directed by Terence Fisher, ""Horror of Dracula"" chronicles events when Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) goes to Dracula’s castle under the pretense of a librarian. Later, the Prince of Darkness travels to Karlstadt, Germany, to prey on Harker's fiancée, Lucy (Carol Marsh), and her relatives, Arthur & Mina (Michael Gough & Melissa Stribling). Dr. Van Helsing (Peter Cushing), a student of vampirism and a friend of Harker’s, shows up to try to put an end to the Count’s reign of terror.  

Hammer Studios did nine Dracula films from 1958 to 1974: Horror of Dracula (1958); The Brides of Dracula (1960); Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966); Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968); Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969); Scars of Dracula (1970); Dracula AD 1972 (1972); The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973); and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974. Christopher played the Count in every one of these except ""The Brides of Dracula"" and ""The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires."" 

Hammer fans typically praise this first film in the series, Lee's first gig as Dracula, and it is a solid entry with the typical Hammer highlights: Lush Gothic ambiance, bright colors, Lee & Cushing and bodacious women. Lee's diabolical interpretation of the Count is another highpoint, not to mention one of the most stunning horror scores by James Bernard. Unfortunately, the abridged story loosely based on Stoker’s novel is somehow unsatisfactory and there are too many 50's limitations IMHO.

Here’s one curious abbreviation: In the book the story starts in Transylvania, switches to England with Dracula voyaging to London, but ends up back in Transylvania for the climax. Coppola’s 1992 film adhered to this European globetrotting, but Hammer decided to simplify the geography where travel time is condensed to something akin to a European theme park rather than reality. The tale starts outside of Klausenburg, the capital of Transylvania in Central Romania at the time, with Drac’s castle nearby, then switches to Karlstadt, in South-Central Germany, which is roughly 750 miles from Klausenburg in reality, yet a mere carriage drive away in this film, perhaps 20 miles.

11873,"Following on from the enjoyable ""Hustler"" (1961), Paul Newman's ""Eddie"" takes the cocky but green pool player ""Vincent"" (Tom Cruise"") under his wing so he can teach him how to win and to win big. Initially hostile to the idea, ""Vincent"" realises his opportunity and pretty quickly the pair are on a tour of the country's pool halls trying to raise enough money to stake their entry in a tournament of champions. Newman is on great form here. His portrayal of the formerly invincible player is strong and nuanced. He knows he is not as good as he once was, but is he now vicariously living through his protégé, or might this younger man galvanise him to raise his game one last time? Cruise is also good as the arrogant and cock-sure youngster and there is some considerable on-screen chemistry between the two as the story follows a not entirely unpredictable path. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (""Carmen"") and Helen Shaver (""Janelle"") both contribute well as the girlfriends, the former trying to keep ""Vincent"" grounded, the latter trying to keep ""Eddie"" motivated, and as they travel we get a sense of a building reliance and animosity between the two that can only lead to fuses blowing. John Tarturro and Forest Whitaker both offer us timely contributions that demonstrate to both men their failings and opportunities along the way, too.

Is it a spoof or a parody? Well I'll leave that to the hard core Spag Western fans to decide, what I do know is that it's good entertainment. Plenty of daft sub-genre staples are adhered to, as are the many cool action sequences as our gruff anti-heroes go about their greed and revenge fuelled ways.

Colizzi wisely keeps his cards close to his chest as regards our trio of lead characters, who in true Spag convention are making it unclear where we are heading. The action is wonderfully kinetic, with some sterling sequences unfolding when our leads get involved in a Texan/Mexican battle. Why I'm still not so sure, but it's exciting stuff!

It's all very derivative, there's no getting away from that, and as the genre often does, it renders the porotags/antags under developed.

In the late Edo era (some decades before its end in 1868) a community is plagued by two opposing gangs who have built up a criminal empire of prostitution and gambling. Even the local officials are on the take. Into this town steps a nameless samurai (Toshiro Mifune). Once they get a taste of his swordsmanship, both sides want to hire him, but he decides to play them off against each other and free the innocent citizens from this evil.

In past films Kurosawa had taken advantage of Mifune's ability to produce exaggerated facial expressions of laughter and fear. Here, however, the nameless samurai is completely unflappable, while it is the criminal bosses and corrupt officials who play the clowns. Ikio Sawamura is a town constable constantly toadying to the gangsters, for example, while Isuzu Yamada gives a memorably sassy performance as the madame of a brothel. In what would become a convention of the Japanese period drama, the numerous henchmen in the gangs were apparently chosen from the most grotesque men that Kurosawa could find (each furthermore has distinctively ratty attire), and one thug is played by an actor suffering from gigantism.

That darkly comedic drama between the characters coexists with brutal violence. Yet, while audiences may have been shocked in 1961 by the samurai dispatching his opponents with realistic slashing sound effects and a hacked off limb, there are only a handful of fights here, and they are all over in a flash. (Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of Mifune's acting is his speed in executing the sword moves.) While Kurosawa delights in gangsters getting their comeuppance, he doesn't revel in gore.

Much has been said about how this Japanese film would inspire Westerns made in America and Europe (Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS was a straight-up remake). However, the film is also interesting for how it draws so much on influences from the West. Kurosawa's inspiration was an American crime caper by Dashiell Hammett, the samurai’s walk down the main street is drawn from the Westerns of John Ford and others, the soundtrack mixes Japanese music with Western instruments such as harpsichord, and Tatsuya Nakadai's pretty-boy looks are clearly modeled on Hollywood.

All in all, I was very impressed by this film. Everything here – from the script and aspect to little things like the wind and dust and the little decorations on the set – seems the result of great effort and talent, all coming together to impress the viewer. And like Kurosawa's RASHOMON, it stays fresh even as its elements have been repeatedly reused by other film and television productions for half a century now.",9.0
11878,"I was surprised when I saw this, how late it was set - 19th Century - as I'd always imagined it to be of a more historical nature. That doesn't remotely detract from the story though - as again Kurosawa casts Yoshirô Mifune (""Sanjûrô"") in the leading role. Here he is a wandering samurai who arrives in a village torn by strife. His skills are sought by the two opposing headmen and he quite successfully manages to play them off against each other - and keep the peace - until one the their sons arrives, armed with a pistol, and completely alters the balance of power. Mifune is superb as the maverick, thoroughly honourable and at times quite amusing ronin - I was reminded a little of the characterisation by Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone films - with a ruthless, violent streak: but somehow only towards those meritorious of their fate. It takes it's time, this - there is a fair degree of character development and as such, I felt quite invested in both Mifune and in his friend the innkeeper (Eijirô Tôno) as their peril gradually increases. The remainder of the cast adds to the tension well as does the frequent use of the weather in helping create the gripping atmosphere making this a corker of a film, very much worth watching.",7.0

When their fireside banter is ruined by a missile shaped like a dead cow; things start to liven up and what ensues is a race against time for their very survival - there are more dangerous creatures in the forest than red squirrels! Kevin McKidd keeps the troop focussed at they face their foes with grim determination and their black humour prevails pretty much throughout their ordeal. The special effects are a little bit ""Dr. Who"" but Neil Marshall ensures the lighting and sound folks do their level best to keep the suspense going for a long as possible and at no stage does it hang about: it's end to end action with a tinge - a soupçon - of horror as the story builds to an enjoyable denouement!

11884,"You have been recruited by The Star League to defend the frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada.

The Last Starfighter is directed by Nick Castle and written by Jonathan R. Betuel. It stars Lance Guest, Robert Preston, Catherine Mary Stewart, Dan O'Herlihy and Norman Snow. Music is by Craig Safan and cinematography by King Baggot. Story sees Guest as Alex Rogan, an everyday teenage boy who upon breaking the high-score record on a trailer park arcade game, suddenly finds himself recruited by an alien defence unit to fight an evil army out in space. 

The advancements of computers and all their devilish electronic off shoots have rendered many of the pioneering effects films of yesteryear as rudimentary antiques. Where once films like ""Tron"" and ""The Last Starfighter"" blazed the trail that many would follow over the years, now they seem, if you believe the multitude of new era reviews for them, to hold only nostalgia value to video game players who were still at school in the early 1980's. That's something of a disservice, for although they do indeed rely in the main on effects work and razz dazzle 80's credibility, the stories are enjoyably fantastical and not without thought and merit. 

The Last Starfighter is one of the better ones because it manages to be both an exciting and sweet picture, one that is completely disarming. Certainly it marries Spielberg homespun values with George Lucas operatics, but in the form of its teen protagonist it also dots the fantasy canvas with angsty worth. So much so that now when one revisits the film with older eyes, we can appreciate more fully that young Alex is in a rut, the crossroads of his life, a life he's struggling to make sense of. Also more appreciation can now be made of the relationship Alex has with Grig (O'Herlihy), his flight navigator up in the galaxy, someone whom he calls a Gung-Ho iguana! This relationship is nicely drawn, here is where Alex finds not only his friend, but also his father figure, something he doesn't have the privilege of down on Earth.

Whilst up there fighting an intergalactic battle, Alex on Earth has been replaced by a Replicant Beta Model to ensure he is not missed. Here is where much of the film's fun is gleaned from. Interesting to note that originally this arc in the film wasn't to be that huge, but test screenings encouraged director Castle into a rethink. And the film is the better for it as the Beta tries to keep the flame going with the girlfriend (Stewart adorable girl next door type) and ensure he's not found out by any Ko-Dan spies! Here Guest earns his corn, it's a very good duel performance from the youngster and it's a shame his career never really took off post the film's release. 

However, none of this means the film is full of depth, it still remains a very simple story full of fantastical incredulity. But the underlying message of improving oneself, not settling for second best, is rich and puts some potency in the narrative. Still, it's safe to say that most tuning into The Last Starfighter want whizz bang space adventure frolics, which thankfully we do get. The effects are of course variable, though not as cheap looking in High Definition as one expected, while the action is nicely constructed by Castle and his team. The villains led by a Po-faced Norman Snow make their mark, while Robert Preston, a legend to Western and film noir fans in the 40's and 50's, gives a wonderfully sweet and affecting turn as Centauri, the game inventor who whisks Alex away to the planet Rylos for his life changing challenge.

11884,"**Overall, it's a decent movie, if not a very good one.**

There is no doubt that, if there is something that marked sci-fi in the 80s, it was arcade games and the popularization of information technology and the personal computer, with the potential that this allowed in everyone's life. However, I have some doubts about the quality of the films it spawned.

In this case, the film begins by showing us a young teenager addicted to a gaming machine who, after beating the last levels of the game, is taken in a futuristic car by a stranger to discover that everything the machine showed was real, and it was in reality true training to find and recruit space pilots for a war in a faraway galaxy, in the best “Star Wars” style. Of course, the movie also has a hormone-filled romance in the middle.

Upon seeing the film, I was a little skeptical about the script and its verisimilitude, but after a bit of reading, I came to discover that, nowadays, there are a lot of digital military systems, and even weaponry, that are made in such a way that be more easily controlled by soldiers who have already had some contact with computer games, and have some dexterity with this type of entertainment. This is something quite ingenious, and also perverse, on equal measures: ingenious because of their pragmaticism, perverse because it puts ""innocent"" video games on an equal footing with real weapons, which destroy and kill real people. Philosophies aside, the film seems to me more accessible and more interesting than others of the same genre and from the same era. The script isn't particularly clever, and it's not difficult to predict the course of events, but it does things reasonably effectively.

The cast is not the strong point of the film. We don't have any major actors involved here, and the whole movie looks like it was made with fairly amateur actors. Lance Guest was credible in the role of the hero, and he does what he needs to, but without great competence and in a relatively weak way. Robert Preston is a little better, but he doesn't have much to do other than be the movie's Yoda. Catherine Mary Stewart appears simply because someone thought the hero had to have a minimally attractive girlfriend.

Technically, the film bets heavily on cinematography, which is reasonably well done, and on good visual and sound effects, which do their job well and look realistic, even if they are a huge distance from what we can do today, which makes the film quite dated but still nice.",4.0

Can he do it? Can he thwart the cunning plan? It's quite a fun fantasy adventure this, Guest joins in wholeheartedly as does Preston and there are plenty of special effects to drown out the occasionally boo-hiss romantic elements with ""Maggie"" (Catherine Mary Stewart).

Disney take on the Robin Hood legend in animation form with family friendly rewards aplenty.

All the characters are drawn as animals, with Robin suitably given a fox make-over, plot revolves around the dastardly machinations of Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham. Who find themselves hindered considerably by Robin and his band of merry men. Meanwhile Robin and Marian are rekindling their romance on the sideline.

Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood - the gent of 12th century English folklore. When the King heads off to fight the Saracens in the crusades, his evil brother remains to extort all he can from the poor population whilst Robin Hood leads the rebellion against this tyrannical regime. The personifications of animals in this film is a masterstroke - and the choice of animals: a snake, fox, bear, lion, badger and even a tortoise all add hugely to the symbolism and fun of this thoroughly enjoyable rendering of the ultimate good v evil tale. I always seem to have a problem with the intrusive scores in Disney's animations - it never seems to let up long enough to let the voices take centre stage, and as such is quite distracting much of the times. That said, I am nit-picking - aside from a rather protracted musical interlude - the action animations are first class and this is a cracking film.",7.0

A modern spin on the Leopold and Loeb case, directed by Barbet Schroeder and starring Sandra Bullock as a cop with emotional baggage trying to prove that two high school kids (Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt) have committed what they think is the perfect murder - just for kicks, allegedly.

There's nothing exactly awful about the film, it's well performed by the principal players, engrossing in narrative, beautifully lensed by Luciano Tovoli and Schroeder layers the production with a suitable feeling of unease. Sadly there's no psychological depth given the two boys by writer Tony Gayton, which renders the whole motives and means, and the investigation of such, as being a shallow exercise in thriller film making.

Running at two hours in length doesn't help matters, because this further irritates that more meat was not written onto Gosling and Pitt's bones, while it also exposes just how hackneyed and clichéd the picture is. Which when the story should be psychologically profound, marks this out as a frustrating viewing experience. 6/10",6.0

How ""Runaway Train"" bombed at the box office in December, 1985, I'll never know because it's the perfect blend of blockbuster thrills and weighty subtext.

The story involves Manny (Jon Voight), a notorious prison hero, who escapes a maximum security prison in the frozen wastelands of Alaska. He is joined by a naive follower (Eric Roberts) and they stow away on a train consisting of four locomotives, but the train runs away. Meanwhile, the arrogant warden (John P. Ryan) is on the warpath for Manny.

""Runaway Train"" is such a powerful experience because it's much more than just a mindless action flick, as the title would suggest. The thrilling events are actually a stage for a fascinating study of the human condition. Manny is a hardened convict who's ""at war with the world and everyone in it."" When called an animal he replies, ""No, worse -- human!""

This is a man who wants one thing, freedom, but he knows that he's too far gone to make it in conventional society. He shares a parable with his dumb partner, made up on the spot, about having a menial job and submitting to the boss even though you might want to rip his throat out. This is the key to making it in society -- submitting to authority and resisting the rage within; and then getting your check on payday and enjoying the fruits thereof. Manny wishes he could do this, but knows he can't. So what hope is there for him in modern society? If he can't do that then why's he escaping prison? In other words, Manny knows there's no hope for him, even if his escape is successful. To him, freedom can only come one way. I don't believe this, but I understand why he believes it.

There's another potent scene where Manny has a knife and mercilessly comes against his own ""partner"". You see the rage on his face, like a cornered animal. After intense emotions are vented Manny suddenly realizes... and then he just bows over, utterly spent. A character, who should be afraid of him, somehow understands and compassionately reaches out in a semi-embrace.

Powerful scenes like these are combined with surreal images of the misshapen locomotives barreling down the tracks in the freezing wilderness accompanied by the ominous score by Trevor Jones. Some parts of the score scream mid-80s, but other parts are timeless.

Rebecca De Mornay has an atypical role as a railroad worker who stumbles on to the convicts. She intuitively sees through their macho posturing. Although she knows they're desperate & dangerous, she also sees that they're not wholly evil. Roberts is basically a kid at heart and Manny is just blinded by the incredible rage within. He's only irredeemable because of his stupid pride, built up over years of hardened confinement.

Voight is near unrecognizable as Manny and Roberts is just superb as his dumb sidekick. These two along with De Mornay are examples of acting at its finest.

John P. Ryan is very effective as the machismo warden Ranken, but his Captain Ahab-like role comes off too comic booky to be plausible. Yet Ranken shows that you can be an ""animal"" on the outside of prison just as much as on the inside. Both Manny and Ranken are corrupted by pride, but Manny at least knows it. And he's not too far gone to recognize those who are worthy of life and to respond accordingly.

The “Police Academy” franchise is increasingly showing signs of wear and tear. After a film far weaker than any of its predecessors, I had hoped that attempts had been made to improve things a little. However, this film is at least as weak as its immediate predecessor. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, quite the opposite. There are much worse and much better rated films out there, and the comedy of this film is quite friendly and familiar, unlike what happens in many other comic films, where the humor is pure and simply dirty. This is an enjoyable movie and sometimes even has some fun… it's just not as good as its predecessors.

The script is based on a series of attempts to stop a group of bandits from carrying out a series of crimes and robberies in a certain area of ​​the city. Obviously, Lassard and Harris will be together to do it, and Harris is only concerned with his own career progression and continues to be the preferred target of the cop trolls we already know. The script is not brilliant, but it manages to support the film in the way it was conceived and executed. It turns out that the quality level is now very low, and this can also be seen in the poverty of the dialogues, in the amount of clichés and situations that, instead of making us laugh, make us wonder to what extent the screenwriter was a competent person.

The cast does what they can with what they've been given, but they don't have the space or material to stand out anyway. Bubba Smith assumes an unquestionable protagonism, but he doesn't have a character or even material that makes him stand out more. Michael Winslow does what he can, but he doesn't stand out much either. Easterbrook and Ramsey are a shadow of what they were in other films. Matt McCoy is no joke and shouldn't be here. Villains can be more idiotic and childish than the Looney Tunes and George Gaynes, as respectable as he is, turned his character into an old man with no memory or sense of the ridiculous. Who is still standing out in some way is G.W. Bailey, but this happens mainly because of the ridiculous situations in which he ends up involved.

Technically, there isn't much to say about this film. It seeks to maintain the characteristics and visual aspect of its predecessors, with standard cinematography, conventional editing and few notable effects, in addition to the shots and some interesting situations, such as the one in which Tackleberry writes with his machine gun.

This one isn't really very different on that front, but DeVito and Crystal do work well together keeping the story from becoming too formulaic and at times it provides quite a poignant assessment of friendship and marriage.

One of the last great epic movies to come out of MGM that was a roaring success, How the West Was Won still has enough quality about it to warrant high praise. The story that drives the film on was suggested by the series of the same name that featured in ""Life"" magazine 1959. Narrative is formed around one family, the Prescott's, who set out on a journey West in 1839. They and their offspring fill out five segments of film that are directed by three different men, ""The Rivers"", ""The Plains"" & ""The Outlaws"" is under the guidance of Henry Hathaway, and ""The Civil War"" by John Ford and ""The Railroad"" by George Marshall. 

Filmed in the unique Cinerama format, which in a nutshell is three cameras filming at once to project a fully formed experience for the human eye, the production has an all star cast and four supreme cinematographers aiding the story. To name all the cast would take forever, but in the main all of the major parts were filled by stars who had already headlined a movie previously. The cinematographers are naturally key since such a sprawling story inevitably has sprawling vistas, they come up trumps with some truly special work: William H. Daniels, Milton Krasner, Charles Lang Jr. & Joseph LaShelle, four great names who help to make the film a poetic beauty.

As a whole it's undeniably far from flawless, complaints such as it running out of steam towards the end (the irony of it since a steam train features prominently), and the plot contrivances, are fair enough. However, when the film is good, it's real good: raft in the rapids, Cheyene attack, buffalo stampede and train robbery, each of them are good enough to be a highlight in separate movies. Even the songs are pleasant, particularly when they revolve around the effervescent Debbie Reynolds, while home format transfers are now finally up to a standard worthy of investment, time and cash wise.

This is a history lesson amped up with melodrama, romance, adventure, violence and song & dance.

The film was done in Cinerama, which was a short-lived cinematic experiment involving three synchronized projectors and a huge curved screen. Only one other film with a traditional story line utilized this process, ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm,"" released the same year. Cinerama was invented so film could keep ahead of its growing rival, television, but it proved too expensive and cumbersome. Despite this, ""How the West was Won"" was a huge success at the box office.

There were epic Westerns before and after, of course, like ""The Big Country"" (1958), ""The Alamo"" (1960), ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) and ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994). What separates ""How the West was Won"" is that it's split into five vignettes directed by three different directors, as follows:

THE RIVERS (1839), directed by Henry Hathaway. This opening segment may turn off viewers with its eye-rolling ""Disney Goes West"" vibe and the corresponding corny dialogue, particularly the lightning fast romance that starts between Linus Rawlings (James Stewart) and Eve Prescott (Carroll Baker). But, if you can endure past such cringe-worthy moments, there's a sudden shift when the travelers run into a malevolent gang of river pirates (Walter Brennan, Lee Van Cleef and cutie Brigid Bazlen). The switch from quaint family-friendly material to nigh shocking violence is notable. One villain gets an ax wung into his back and another a knife into his chest (!). The episode ends with a thrilling fatal rafting sequence. Karl Malden plays the patriarch while Debbie Reynolds plays the less-romantic sister. I must say that the producers knocked it out of the ballpark by featuring Baker, Reynolds and Bazlen in the female department; all three are breathtaking.

THE PLAINS (1851), directed by Henry Hathaway. Lilith Prescott (Reynolds) ends up in St. Louis as a dance hall performer where she learns she's inherited a gold mine in California. A handsome gambler (Gregory Peck) catches wind and tags along on the wagon train, led by a character played by the great Robert Preston. Both guys want the babe, but only the latter seems sincere, which curiously doesn't interest Lilith. This segment is highlighted by Reynold's beauty and her entertaining song & dance sequences and a thrilling Cheyanne attack on the wagon train.

THE CIVIL WAR (1861-1865), directed by John Ford. This segment starts at the Prescott homestead in Ohio where the son of Lilith, Zeb (George Peppard), decides to join the Civil War, after his dad did a couple of years earlier. This is the weakest of the vignettes because the scenes where Ulysses Grant (Harry Morgan) and General Sherman (John Wayne) hang out are obviously studio bound and, worse, the Shiloh battle sequence is almost non-existence. What a letdown!

THE RAILROAD (1868), directed by George Mashall. After the war Lieutenant Zeb gets a gig in the U.S. Cavalry, trying to maintain peace with the Indians while befriending grizzled buffalo hunter Jethro Stuart (Henry Fonda), but Zeb becomes disillusioned when an arrogant railroad mogul (Richard Widmark) violates treaties with the Arapaho by building in their territories. The Natives retaliate by stampeding bison through the railroad camp and killing many. It's an impressive sequence.

THE OUTLAWS (1889) directed by Henry Hathaway. Widowed, Lilith moves from San Francisco to her remaining asset, an Arizona ranch, inviting Zeb (Peppard) and his wife (Carolyn Jones) & kids to oversee it. But Marshal Zeb is threatened by a vengeful outlaw (Eli Wallach). Instead of waiting for the thug to strike, Zeb goes on the offensive with the help of reluctant Marshal Lou Ramsey (Lee J. Cobb). They hide out on a train with an unusually large gold shipment to ambush the outlaw and his gang. The exciting climax is impressive for its time and obviously influential in action-oriented cinema.

As you can see, the movie is a series of thinly-connected stories with a few characters carrying over to other segments (Baker, Reynolds, Peck, Peppard). It's a big film rather than a great one. But you have to respect its uniqueness and the fact that it pulls out all the stops to entertain on so many levels. The score by Alfred Newman, for instance, is one of the all-time best film compositions. While the movie sometimes disappoints — particularly the opening ""Disney goes West"" vibe and the truncated Civil War sequence — there's just too much good here to give it a bad grade. You just have to be willing to acclimate to its quirks and uniqueness. Needless to say, don't expect a conventional Western because ""How the West was Won"" is anything but.

The film runs 164 minutes and was shot in Kentucky & Illinois in the East; and South Dakota, Utah, Arizona, California and Oregon in the West .

11897,"It's almost impossible to imagine how anyone could have amassed such a complete complement of Hollywood A-listers (both in front of, and behind, the camera) to make this epic tale of the pioneering American spirit in the 19th century. From the opening bars of Alfred Newman's score, you can rest assured that we are in for something grand - and, cinematographically speaking, we certainly are. The story is essentially episodic in nature, depicting three stages in the lives of families who emigrate west, encountering just about every obstacle and danger imaginable as the gold rush, railroads (and robbers!), Indians, civil war - and the terrain - challenge even the most adaptable and determined of families. Debbie Reynolds provides some early camp-fire entertainment with a rousing rendition of Sammy Cahn's ""Home in the Meadow"" that sets the scene as they traverse the wilderness. No point listing the stars, it would be easier to list the ones who didn't take part - but there are some notable efforts from Karl Malden and Jimmy Stewart as our journey begins; George Peppard has a distinct glint in his eye, Henry Fonda ""Jethro"" - and Richard Widmark also adds a bit of character as the hard-nosed railroad man ""King"". The ageing processes are less well managed, the application of some grey dye to Reynolds and Peppard is so obvious as to question it's necessity - we know many years have elapsed, this just seems to exaggerate what we are quiet capable of imagining. The writing benefits from one hand at the tiller (there were three directors and as many on the photography); with some frequently pithy, earthy dialogue well delivered by the plethora of acting talent. It's 2¾ hours long, this - but we are carried along without much drudgery through their escapades, love stories, tragedies and sheer bloody-mindedness well. The narration from Spencer Tracy borders on the oozingly sentimental at times, especially with his epilogue but if you enjoy a good western, then this is hard to beat...",7.0

Alec Guinness plays the entire (somewhat doomed) ""D'Ascoyne"" family outstandingly (especially, I thought, the vicar) and both Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood complete this excellent casting of this very enjoyable dark comedy that has the odd extra twist to complicate things nicely. It is one of those films you can watch over and over again and it just doesn't get wearisome.",8.0
11898,"For everything that I'd heard about this film, I was left underwhelmed. I'd always heard that Alec Guinness was superb, playing multiple characters, but most of them were on screen for just a moment. Yes, the makeup artist did a good job making them all visually distinct, but only a couple really have a role to play in the story. There is one shot, clever for the time, which brings them all ""together"" which you can admire on a technical level. It does nothing to raise the piece.

Honestly, all of that is a side-show to the actual story and had it been six different actors the film would be unaffected.

The humour is that of a gentle farce and personally it caused little more than a wry smile for me. I realise it's ""of it's time"", but even for the late '40s I think it's pedestrian.",4.0
11901,"Supernatural Western?

A lone gunman with no name and seemingly with no past, rides into the dusky town of Lago. The residents of Lago at first view the stranger with suspicion, but when news that some outlaws that are out for blood are on their way to town, they ask the stranger for his help. 

This is Clint Eastwood's first Western film that he directed, and it's clear and evident that the guy not only loves the genre that made his name, he also knows what makes it work. Obviously having worked for Sergio Leone, Eastwood was making notes because High Plains Drifter oozes the mythical aura of many of Leone's finest genre offerings. To which, with thanks, the result is one of the best offerings in the 70s for the Oater enthusiast. 

The film opens with our mysterious drifter slowly coming out of the beautiful sprawling haze and into Lago, it's ethereal, then there's just the sound of the horse breathing and the clop of its hooves that can be heard (the sound mix here is incredible), it's a gloriously mysterious opening that sets the tone perfectly. Yet Eastwood is just toying with us though, for a quick jolt of sex and violence snaps us out of the beatific warmth and into a quite hauntingly cold and morally challenged place. From here on in the stranger will demand all manner of odd things from the residents of Lago, he seems to be toying with them and revelling in their discomfort, with Lago quickly resembling an arid hellhole. You see, Lago has a dark secret, and our mysterious stranger has a purpose, and it's this purpose that makes High Plains Drifter an intriguing and gripping experience. 

A well known fact now is that the great man of the genre, John Wayne, wrote Eastwood to strongly complain about his harsh vision of the West, one can only think the Duke failed to grasp the post Vietnam feel of a 70s made Western. It's a great directorial effort from Eastwood, more so when you marry up his acting performance to his directorial duties. Very much the perfect role, it lets Eastwood accentuate his rugged Western leanings. Eastwood would direct the similarly themed Pale Rider in the 80s and then the genre crown topper Unforgiven in the 90s. A Western great in each decade? Well that will always be debatable, but what we do know is that the Western genre was considerably lucky to have had such a man to keep the genre going for the newer interested wanderers into the Wild West. 

Beautifully photographed (Bruce Surtees) on the shores of Mono Lake, California, it's a film pungent with sex, sadism, retribution and risks. High Plains Drifter is mystical and magnificent and essential Western fare. 9/10",9.0
11901,"I don't have much to say about <em>'High Plains Drifter'</em>. It didn't thrill me or anything, but it did keep my attention from start-to-finish so it's evidently a good film.

Clint Eastwood is the only cast member worth talking about, he gives a commanding performance in the lead role. Geoffrey Lewis, a frequent castmate of Eastwood's, is the best of the rest, if I had to pick. The film does feature dark themes, which helps the film's pacing out a lot.

It's nothing special in my eyes, though there is entertainment there no doubt. It's a borderline 8* rating for me, but not quite.",7.0
11901,"Another Hollywood (spaghetti) formula Western where homicidal maniacs abound.
Here, Clint plays a homicidal maniac who obviously comes back from the dead after being killed by three bad guys and betrayed by an entire town of people.
So, the first thing he does is murder the only three men who weren't part of that. Makes sense? Not if you're looking for credible motivation.
But credible motivation isn't a part of most of Eastwood's Westerns. Certainly not the spaghetti ones.
So, the rest of the movie is just sound and fury, signifying nothing, and don't try to make sense out of any of it. It's just another movie about homicidal maniacs being everywhere. If the West or East or anywhere was anything like this, there wouldn't be anyone left in one piece to keep a town going. They'd all either be dead or crippled.
But Eastwood loved to be in that sort of thing. A hundred years from now, he'll be remembered for many good Westerns like Hang Em High and Joe Kidd, and his Rawhid series, and Dirty Harry, because he played credible characters in those. 
He doesn't do that here.",2.0
11901,"**_Clint paints the Western town red, like Gehenna_**

A mysterious Stranger (Eastwood) trots into a remote town in west-central California, a dozen miles from the Nevada border. The townspeople desperately need his help to prepare for the release of three vengeful men from the territorial prison.

""High Plains Drifter"" (1973) was Clint’s third directorial effort (although he also did some uncredited work on “Dirty Harry”). It parallels his “Pale Rider” from a dozen years later with the difference that Preacher from “Pale Rider” is essentially righteous and therefore protects worthy people whereas Stranger in this flick is vengeful, focusing on dishing out retribution to those who are bad. The fact that there are few ‘good’ people in Lago makes you root for the Stranger, to a degree, but it also prevents the viewer from having compassion for the townsfolk.

There’s also an emptiness and tediousness to the proceedings that works against the movie. Still, this is an iconic Eastwood Western and holds up in its unique, nigh satirical way.

The beautiful Marianna Hill plays the blonde, Callie. She was 30 years-old during shooting. You might remember her from the Star Trek episode “Dagger of the Mind” from seven years prior. She was one of the most winsome women to appear on Star Trek and had gigs in numerous television shows throughout the 60s and 70s, as well as quite a few films like Elvis' ""Paradise, Hawaiian Style,” this one, and even starred in the atmospheric horror flick ""Messiah of Evil” (aka “Dead People”), which came out the year after this. It was the pinnacle of her career and she faded out of acting after 1977.

The film runs 1 hours, 44 minutes, and was shot at Mono Lake, California (the town of Lago), which is northeast of Yosemite National Park (with the west side of the lake being in the park), as well as Winnemucca Lake, Nevada, which is about 170 miles due north of Mono Lake.

11902,"**A black comedy made for a restricted audience.**

The film follows much of Yugoslav history, from its occupation by the Germans during World War II to its dismemberment. This is done through a small handful of characters: Marko and Blacky are friends, but follow different life paths: one becomes a kind of boss of the Communist Party, the other the head of a clandestine arms factory, which helps the another to get rich

Directed by Emir Kusturica, it's a rather surreal and hard-to-understand film that feels like it was made for a niche audience that I don't belong to. There is something deeply cynical about all this, especially if we consider the critical way in which the director thought of the film: it is a film that does not bother to explain historical events, presumes that we already know them, and works on them in order to criticize the way we look at war heroes.

I honestly prefer not to talk too much about the cast because I don't know any of those involved. Anyway, I feel they did a pretty satisfying job, considering the film it is and what the director wanted to do. The script has a lot of black humor, sometimes of debatable taste, and there are a number of issues that, if we think about it, make us question the plausibility of the script. For example, how is it possible for a group of people to stay hidden underground for so long without knowing what is going on in the world around them. It does not make sense.

Technically, the film has excellent sets and a very well achieved cinematography. The editing is, however, a little poorly done as the film fails to maintain a regular pace, with several scenes too long. But what tired and irritated me the most was the strident soundtrack, dominated by a brass band and songs, with an adequate Slavic sound, but exaggeratedly strong and flashy.",3.0
11902,"Though this is a bit hit and miss, and I do wonder just how many editions of the BBC's ""'Allo 'Allo"" director Emir Kustrica had watched, this is still quite an entertaining look at the evolution of Yugoslavia from it's wartime Chetnik phase through until the dismantling of the country following the death of Tito. It's split into three distinct parts, and the start reminded me a little of the beginning of ""Hannibal Brooks"" (1969) with a zoo getting bombed and keeper ""Ivan"" (Slavko Stimac) rescuing one of his charges - a chimp this time, not an elephant. What now ensues follows how he, his brother ""Marko"" (Pedrag Manojlovic) and his best pal ""Blacky"" (Lazar Ristovski) as they try to keep their families safe during the Naxi onslaught whilst, at the same time, making a few extra dinars dealing on the black market. Only ""Marko"" gets to go above ground, the others remain below for their own safety - but as the war concludes, the former doesn't enlighten the latter - and so like a bunch of unaware moles, they continue to manufacture their munitions oblivious of the changes up top that see their new focus being anti-Communist activities as the regime of Josef Tito becomes firmly entrenched. The final phase deals with a sort of messy reconciliation of the first two parts as well as addressing the more raw issues faced as their country disintegrates into an abyss of civil war with profiteering and treachery rife, they lose touch and chaos reigns - despite the presence of the light blue berets of the UN troops. It's quite a long old watch, this, and there are times when you could easily take a razor blade to it, but the characterisations are quite enjoyably zany and entertaining whilst leaving enough substance to their principled behaviour in defence of their country and their communities to provoke some thought, too. The comedy isn't really sophisticated, it's actually pretty slap-stick for the most part (there's a scene at the end with a burning electric wheelchair that does rather sum the whole thing up), but that humour is used to quite potent effect pointing out just how traumatic it was for anyone growing up in this part of the Balkans in the last half of the 20th century, and at how stoically and energetically many took up that challenge. I can't say that any of the acting particularly stood out (except maybe the monkey having great fun inside a fully armoured tank), it's more of an ensemble effort that mixes farce with history quite engagingly.",7.0

It's in one such dream, and whilst walking through the woods to visit her elderly relative that she encounters a handsome and enigmatic young man who wants to bet who will reach the old woman's house first! She is intrigued, but is she prepared for the true identity of her admirer? Though the story is a bit staccato at times, but this is still a rich and vividly constructed adaptation of a story that mixes romance, fable and a soupçon of horror cleverly and entertainingly - whilst subtly presenting an undercurrent of emerging sexuality. Sure, some of the effects are not what they might be and the stylised presentation doesn't always work, but the storytelling of ""Granny"" and some of her warnings about the path, the fruit and about a chap whose eyebrows meet in the middle are engagingly delivered by an on form, and ideally cast Lansbury.

11906,"There seems to be a never-ending feud between many horror fans regarding 'Suspiria', due to the fact that this film is considered Dario Argento's outstanding masterpiece. Personally, I'm completely against the idea of praising something that you don't actually like, so I respect anyone who thinks that this movie is overrated or even plain awful. My summary is only an opinion, but by no means I intend to make people change their mind or disapprove their concept of this film.

'Suspiria' is one of the many Italian horror films that came out during the late 70s and early 80s, that is extremely criticized for having a supposedly questionable plot and denouement. If we compare this movie to some of the other popular films directed by Dario Argento, we're probably going to think that 'Suspiria', is perhaps not as intriguing or well developed, when it comes to the story. To give a few examples of some of the Argento films that are widely considered the actual masterpieces because they offer an intriguing plot, good imagery and well done endings, I would probably name 'The Bird with the Crystal Plumage', 'Deep Red' and 'The Cat o' Nine Tails'. So what is it that we should believe? Nothing! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and even though I agree with those who claim that 'Suspiria' is Argento's real masterpiece, I would never waste my time trying to convince people that this is true. As a matter of fact, I'll be honest and say that I also believe that 'Suspiria' has a somehow underdeveloped story, but I still regard it as one of the best horror movies in history. The reason is simple: in my opinion, you can make something wonderful, without a wonderful plot. This is perhaps one of the most visually enchanting horror movies I have seen so far and I honestly doubt I will ever find another film that can enchant me as much as this one. Everything about 'Suspiria' is beautiful, even the violent deaths. I know this may sound sick and disgusting, but I believe Mr. Argento has the special gift to make beautiful images out of gruesome situations, like murder, for example. From the beginning until the end, this film takes us to a dark dreamland with beautiful contrasting colors, eerie locations and a recurrent unsettling music. The locations are perfect. The ballet school in which the story takes place, seems to be a nonexistent place taken from someone's dream. Indeed, it was revealed once that 'Suspiria' was partly inspired by a dream that Daria Nicolodi once had (Mrs. Nicolodi was the co-writer and Argento's girlfriend at the time). So if the idea was to create a dream-like movie, I would say they did a perfect job. Everything about 'Suspiria' looks surreal and charming. It's a dark fairy tale, in which the characters behave in a childish way, like playing along with the scenario. It is also said that the actresses were initially supposed to be little girls, but fearing that the film could be banned, Argento had to choose older actresses, but he didn't really change much of the dialogs, which I think is genius. Strangely, the characters don't come off as moronic or anything, they simply are strange and childish, but in a good way. The subject of sex, for example, is barely even mentioned, which is something that doesn't happen too often in horror movies with twenty-something year old characters. But regarding the actors who played these characters, I would mostly compliment the work of the late actresses Joan Bennett and Alida Valli. The young cast was simply fine, but no one did a remarkable job. Not even Jessica Harper, who was a bad choice for the lead character, in my opinion. This is probably the only little detail I would criticize about this film. Mrs. Harper pretty much has the same facial expression and tone of voice throughout the entire film, which is not good. On the other hand, like I said before, Mrs. Valli and Mrs. Bennett were flawless as the two bitter old women who run the school with their awful temper and their little psychological tortures against those who stand in their ways.

So concluding: 'Suspiria' is one of those films that you either love or hate. Both feelings are equally respectable and I can understand why some people don't really appreciate it. But if I have to recommend or 'sell' this movie to someone, I would definitely highlight the dream-like imagery and the creepy music composed by The Goblins, that go perfectly well with what is seen on the screen. Enjoy this dark fairy tale about witches and childish girls.",10.0

This is a masterpiece. Nothing will ever come close to this movie’s cinematography and soundtrack. Many people comment on the ‘style over substance’ aspect of Suspiria (and some of Argento’s other films), but I don’t see it as a flaw. It’s an experience. I don’t care if everything makes 100% perfect sense, when I put Suspiria on I feel transported to another world and that’s the best kind of movie. One that can just take you away from the real world. 

Suspiria is oddly comforting to me. I guess it’s that taking me away from the world feeling. It feels like a hug which I know isn’t what Argento was going for, but hey, apparently people ran out of theatres screaming in the 70s and I’m just a freak.

Would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I can’t imagine not liking it. I get that the dubbing and the cinematography or whatever may be a little jarring at first as beautiful it is, but go in with an open mind and let yourself get lost in the beautiful world of Suspiria and I can’t see anyone at least not somewhat liking it.

11908,"_**Slasher parody with good plot & technical work, but too raunchy and not funny enough**_

Tired of partying on Bourbon Street, a guy and his buddy (Joel David Moore and Deon Richmond) decide to take a night sightsee with other tourists at the alligator-infested bog, unaware of the dubious nature of the tour and the legend of a notorious hatchet man lurking the woods.

""Hatchet"" (2006) is a horror/comedy/spoof that combines the indoor swamp sets of “Man-Thing” (2005) with elements of the “Wrong Turn” or “Friday the 13th” franchises and the parody tone of “Club Dread” (2004). Regrettably, it’s the least of these. There’s nothing wrong with the cast or technical filmmaking as the gore, F/X and swamp sets are fine, although the ‘monster’ make-up looks kinda cartoonish (which fits the genre).

While it’s relatively amusing and occasionally funny, it’s hindered by an odious raunchy air right out of the gate. For instance, the two supposedly hot girls flash their breasts every 5 minutes in the first half hour. Don’t take that as prudish, I’m just pointing out that a movie is questionable when it goes overboard with female nudity to hide its deficiencies. Meanwhile the heroine played by Amara Zaragoza is interesting, but she has little sex appeal, although that’s a matter of taste.

I could handle those flaws if the story was more compelling and the humor more amusing, yet that’s not the case. Although the plot is great, the script needed a rewrite to flesh out better prospects. But that takes time & money and the flick only cost 1.5 million, which is almost six times LESS than what “Club Dread” cost.

I should add that Kane Hodder plays the Jason-like antagonist while Robert Englund has a cameo in the opening.     

The film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, with a longer version running an additional 9 minutes. It was shot in New Orleans (Mardi Gras sequences) with the swamp scenes done in a convincing indoor set at Sable Ranch, Santa Clarita, California.

11916,"This is terrific. <em>'Two Mules for Sister Sara'</em> is highly enjoyable.

I have many positives. Clint Eastwood is tremendous in one of the two lead roles, I know he seemingly plays this sorta character a lot, at least early on in his career, but man is he quality at it. Shirley MacLaine is great alongside Mr. Eastwood, she suits and plays her character extremely well. The two have excellent chemistry. Elsewhere, Manolo Fábregas spearheads the rest.

How about that score? I love it! Impossible not to tap along to whenever the main title is used and every single time it sounds so, so good. Ennio Morricone, what a ledge! The humour in this 1970 film is also top notch, while the pacing and editing is also on point.

In Mexico during Maximilian's brief reign (1864-67), a nun named Sara (Shirley MacLaine) is rescued from three rowdy rapists by a loner named Hogan (Clint Eastwood). The pair team-up and assist the Juaristas in their fight to free Mexico from French rule. Manolo Fábregas plays the colonel of the Juaristas.

Released in 1970 and directed by Don Siegel, ""Two Mules for Sister Sara""  is superior to Eastwood's first two ""Man with No Name"" movies. While it's not technically as good as the renowned ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966), it has a more compelling story with better characters.

And that's the key to this movie's effectiveness: It focuses on the two protagonists and their developing relationship. Because we're interested in them we're more interested in the extraordinary events with which they're entangled. 

Speaking of which, there's a nice buffet of Western staples: gunfights, an Indian attack, a saloon scene, a train wreck, a house of ill repute and a rollicking climax. MacLaine is young, beautiful and charismatic here.

11929,"Welcome to Maine; where alcoholism, smoking, and all sorts of behavior the aforementioned are trying to cover up creep up on you like bad filling of gravy. At least, in Stephen King’s universe. True to his (excessive) words, a lot gets stirred up, not all of it gets answered, and characters  get knee high in lots of details. Nothing wrong about that, except in this movie the details, and the melodrama that comes with them, tend to bog down what should be bonding of two women over the men that hurt them. What a depressingly masculine mess.

I love a good pulpy environment (hello film noir, which often has a mystery element to it like this movie) but someone how the pacing was just off. I think Kathy Bates does a pretty fantastic job as the the title character. Her daughter Selena though.. I don’t know if it meant more in the book but her talks about the story in Arizona she wants to cover doesn’t really anything interesting to the mix. Maybe it’s to show what bad decisions she’s made after having no family to turn to, but it’s belaboured. We get she’s a emotional mess without it. I also don’t think Jennifer Jason Leigh is all that great in the role, but then again she mostly just sits there to reveal plot points and be something Dolores scarified for. She’s a talking macguffin.
Much more interesting is the relationship between Dolores and Det. Mackey, played gravely by Christopher Plummer. Oh, and that odd looking John C. Riley as his deputy. His face always livens everything up. There’s a bit of destructive perfectionist streak in Mackey, wanting to close the book on the case he never solves to his satisfaction. At some points this runs into cop drama play by play (including  a[albeit mercifully short] courtroom scene. Were 90’s Hollywood films required to have those in at least one scene?), but it helped by little details, like throwing a full piss pan at the other.

But whose piss was that? Why the fermenting yellow liquid of Vera, a women we seem to think Dolores killed. We know that’s not true though, any two who exchange such old fashioned zingers (“Dolores, I insist that all women who have hysterics in my drawing room call me by my Christian name.”)  and share body fluids can’t hate each other. Maybe with only one, but both? Nay. Besides, it’s much more fun to tag team to doom a alcoholic sexual predator. Her husband; Am I spoiling anything by saying she did kill him? Then it would only be 95% special victims unit, not totally. Might as well cook up all that gravy, a full crock.
This does lead to two defining  moments for Dolores. The log back rub to milk cranium massage is pretty good vicious, but mere flower play before the eclipse.  After finding Joe has been stealing from her (by proxy of having a penis and the bank therefore believing his bullshit) and abusing a young Selena she plays to stuff him down a well, when everyone is watching the sun black out. This scene is certainly memorable, if not only for the almost baroque visual style (lot of key light) but where she seems to set an olympic record for long jumping, right over the hole. Frankly, this should have been the ending, it’s Dolores best movement, and since she really sets the stage for everyone else to ladle out in, it’s a wonderfully creepy way out. Instead we wait another quarter of a film to pass by.

Anything not Dolores tends to be too congested to be found appetizing. I wage she was more of  the center of attention originally, and the other parts were attempting to give the actors more to do, or give more speaking time to the men. This is dubious; King material tends to be overripe as it is, but imitation King (as practiced by director Taylor Hackford and writer Tony Gilroy) is even more stagy. Fine, she helped her daughter, who recognizes it nearly twenty years later, and she amused an entertaining old lady. But the real Dolores, and where Bates is at her best, wrapped all the pain she took from an abusive husband, and leaped over to stomp down someone who hurt her young, like a fierce chicken. A little more strut, a little more pecking, and we would have a fine character study between her and her golden egg. Guess you take what you can get, and go on with your day, especially in Maine.",10.0
11929,"This one tends to get ignored when people consider the 'classic' Stephen King film adaptations (the first 20 years), but it's very subtle, nuanced, and is basically one of King's finest and more mature works. If it was even possible for Kathy Bates to out-do her Oscar-winning work in 'Misery', she still did so, and nailed it. I'm a huge fan of John C. Reilly, Eric Bogosian (why 'Talk Radio is my favourite Oliver Stone movie and 'Under Siege 2' my favourite Steven Seagal film), David Strathairn, Christopher Plummer and especially, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and the Tony Gilroy script serves them beautifully.

Unfairly, I tend to joke about director Taylor HACKford, but it just may be that he's a more contemporary model of such versatile directors from the past as Norman Jewison and Robert Wise. That's fairly esteemed company--and here, he abides himself quite nicely in some of his best work.",9.0

Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain.

Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present.

A terrifically well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly.

The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward - the latter of which is nearly unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan whom wants some intelligent emotional heft in the screenplay. 8/10",8.0

The central premise of a horror road trip, where the lead couple each believe the other party is the culprit (and are both wrong) is pretty solid, as is the final showdown, but the connective tissue is a bit wishy washy, and the inability to commit to a tone doesn't serve the movie very well, putting it at a lower point than any of its predecessors.

11933,"Now, here's a film that doesn't quite know it's 1991 and attempts a bizarre ode to The <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre </i> (1974), albeit with PG sensibility. Demi Moore is one of the film's main revelations and she masters its wackiness with a strangely befitting coolness. Ackroyd <i>is</i> the wackiness, but that's only if you can recognize him under the genius of the makeup-grotesquery. 

Ackroyd directs here as well as plays the hick judge of a-town-time-forgot and has a lot of fun playing with unsuspecting passers-through. The set pieces are inspired too and this truly is an odd yet fun ride, once it gets going. The only real contention is Chevy Chase who's a real stick in the mud - Tom Hanks was unfortunately busy.",6.0

A NASA space mission up to Mars fails to get off the ground due to major technical problems. Fearing funding could be taken away and wishing to avoid embarrassment, the powers that be decide to do a fake landing in a studio. With the astronauts forced to pretend that they are actually up on Mars, and fighting with their own personal belief systems, the government executives in charge fear that the fake flight could come to light. Upon learning that the outside world actually thinks they crashed upon reentering the earths atmosphere, the astronauts run for their lives knowing that the government can't afford for the men to stay alive.

Capricorn One is an excellent conspiracy picture that sadly seems to have been largely forgotten. Even today we are still hearing mooted stories of the landing on the moon actually being fake, so here director and writer Peter Hyams takes it and crafts a thrillingly taut piece of work. At the films heart is Elliot Gould's (his great 70s work under valued) intrepid journalist, Robert Caulfield, after being nudged in the ribs by one of his friends at NASA, is himself under threat of death from shadowy government types who will think of nothing to offing him along with the astronauts.

The film is split into two very significant halves, the first half is the set up, the conversations before and after the fake landing are clever and crucially attention grabbing, and of course we get to know our characters with the right amount of time. The film then shifts for the second half into a quality thriller chase movie, our main protagonists pursued by the government assassins courtesy of two gun toting helicopters. Jerry Goldsmith's score brilliantly becoming part of the chase sequences, making the helicopters seem like death stalking machines operated by no man alone. We even get Telly Savalas joining us for the last quarter with a highly fun and enjoyable portrayal as a crop dusting knight in red shiny armour, and the finale positively rocks and finishes the film on the high note it promised all along. James Brolin, Brenda Vaccaro, Sam Waterston, O.J. Simpson, Hal Holbrook and Karen Black fill out the rest of the cast with much credit indeed.

11942,"One man and his quest for meaning turns into a Peckinpah classic.

El Jefe is outraged to find that his daughter has fallen pregnant to a man who has upped and gone, after learning the identity of the rascal (Alfredo Garcia), he offers one million dollars to anyone who can bring him the head of the Lothario running man. On the trail are hit men Quill & Sappensly, Bennie & his prostitute girlfriend Elita, and some other Mexican bandit types, all of them are on a collision course that will bring far more than they all bargained for.

This was the one film where director Sam Peckinpah felt he had the most control, the one where we apparently get his own cut and not some chopped up piece of work from interfering executives. Viewing it now some 34 years after its release, it stands up well as a testament to the work of a great director. On the surface it looks trashy, we have homosexual hit men, grave robbing, potential rape, murders abound, prostitution, lower than the low characters, in short the film is awash with Peckinpah traits. Yet it would be a disservice to even think this film isn't rich in thematic texture, for the journey that Bennie, our main protagonist takes is one of meaning, he is a loser, but we find him on this quest to find not only fortune, but respect and love. It's a bloody trail for sure, but it has much depth and no little Peckinpah humour to push the film to it's bloody yet triumphant finale. Warren Oates is rewarded by Peckinpah for years of sterling work for him by getting the lead role of Bennie, and he grasps it with both hands to turn in a wonderful performance that splits sadness and vibrancy with deft of ease.

Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia has a harsh quality about it, be it the violence, or be it the sadness of the characters, but what isn't in doubt to me is that it's harshness is cloaked in Peckinpah splendour. 9/10",9.0
11942,"Some of the works of Peckinpah had been on my watch list for months, sitting there in a subfolder of a subfolder. From the choice of Straw Dogs and Cross of Iron, I chose the aforetitled, liking the idea of embarking on a bit of a journey through Mexico with a gritty protagonist as we experience splatterings of violence and negotiate the thoughts of a down and out vagabond making a ran for his riches.

The film left me with mixed feelings. I enjoyed the path of Benny, experiencing how his character is unwavering in his desire to take that last lucky ticket out of debauchery street, but didn't care much for his journey's partner. While I appreciated the dynamic of the relationship, the understanding they both had that they weren't in love with each other, but all they both had, the chemistry and dialogue didn't really resonate with me at parts. I actually was rather glad when this relationship came to its abrupt end as the film entered its final 3rd.

On top of that, there was major issues with the sound which made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the journey at times. I found myself feeling I was watching a caricature of a 70s movie now and again, as opposed to be engrossed in a gritty noir-esque adventure.

But all in all, an enjoyable film which has left an impression. I always appreciate watching unpolished characters navigating circumstances plotted outside their usual courses, then watching how they deal with the inevitable implosion. From what I've read since, the film was one which perhaps accurately portrayed the director's life at the time of filming; dealing with various booze-infused demons. That rawness definitely shows, as does the inevitable imperfections in this movie's execution.",8.0
11943,"The Rocky Mountains are the marrow of the World.

Jeremiah Johnson is directed by Sydney Pollack and is inspired by two books, Raymond Thorp and Robert Bunker's Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson and Vardis Fisher's Mountain Man. Script was written by John Millius and Edward Anhalt and cinematography is by Duke Callaghan. It stars Robert Redford, Will Geer, Stefan Gierasch, Delle Bolton and Josh Albee.

Hardened after the war with Mexico, and fed up with everyday life, American Jeremiah Johnson (Redford) leaves civilisation behind to live life as a mountain man. He intends to be self-sufficient as a trapper, but he finds that mother nature can be tough, and out here in the mountain wilderness he is not alone. There are others here, and Jeremiah must face many challenges if he is to truly survive.

Filmed entirely on location in the vast wilderness beauty of Utah, Jeremiah Johnson is light on plot but all the better for it. Film basically constitutes Redford's mountain man learning to survive up in them thar mountains, and, earning the right to do so. A number of issues will arise to test his metal, giving him a number of hardships and adventures to define his transformation from average Joe to a fully fledged mythical man of the Earth. Redford is wonderfully at ease in the title role, and very quickly he gets the audience on side to share in his journey. But ultimately it's the landscapes that you take away from this movie. Not only gorgeous, but also the critical character that frames Johnson during his isolation and battle for survival. 8/10",9.0

11948,"This offers a really poignant look at what we might describe as mutual insanity. ""Maj. Celliers"" (David Bowie) is convicted by the occupying Japanese on the island of Java on citing rebellion. With hindsight, perhaps he would rather not have been, but he is spared the firing squad and sent to the POW camp of ""Col Yonoi"" (Ryuichi Sakamoto) who leaves much of the day to day brutality to his henchman ""Sgt. Hara"" (Takeshi Kitano). Also interned is ""Col. Lawrence"" (a strong performance from Tom Conti) who knows a thing or two about the culture of their ""hosts"" and tries, as best he can, to mediate and mitigate their worst excesses. What now ensues depicts the brutality - physical and psychological employed by the sadistic ""Hara"" whilst interspersed with some retrospectives giving us some of the back-story of ""Celliers"" and his life of privilege back home. The production is rich and alluring to watch; Bowie and Sakamoto both look beautiful here - and perhaps that adds to the potency of the cruelty of the latter more. The gist of the story calls into question an whole range of emotions from the more visceral to the more profound and though it is probably a bit too long, the powerfully emotive performances are captivating. Bowie maybe wasn't the best actor ever, but here he excels and with Sakamoto provides something really quite thought provoking.",7.0
11950,"Silly car chase flick with loads of stars and… Catherine Bach

RELEASED IN 1983 and directed by Hal Needham, ""Cannonball Run II"" is a car chase comedy about a second Cannonball Run race from the West Coast to the East Coast. The teams include JJ & Victor (Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise), Blake and Fenderbaum (Dean Martin & Sammy Davis Jr.) with other teams involving Jackie Chan & Richard Kiel in a submersible Mitsubishi Starion and Mel Tillis & Tony Danza accompanied by an orangutan. There are at least a dozen other notable co-stars in various roles: Jamie Farr, Telly Savalas, Sid Caesar, Tim Conway, Foster Brooks, Ricardo Montalban , Charles Nelson Reilly, Don Knotts, etc.

This is a fun turn-off-your-brain flick with an incredible all-star cast that’s worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, the script needed a rewrite with better jokes but the producers obviously didn’t want to blow the money. As it is, too much of the humor falls flat, but “Cannonball Run II” is still leagues better than comparable junk like “Smokey and the Bandit Part 3” (1983). And there’s a worthwhile sequence where Dom does an amusing Brando impersonation.

Moreover, the movie scores good marks on the female front with Catherine Bach jaw-dropping in form-fitting blue spandex during the first half, teamed with her Amazonian-ish partner Susan Anton (who’s no slouch in the beauty department). Bach's buttocks looks like it was sculptured by God Himself. In addition, there’s Marilu Henner and Shirley MacLaine, who catch a ride with JJ & Victor, masquerading as nuns before revealing their real identities. Maclaine was 48 during shooting but still had a great figure.

11951,"The last American hero to whom speed means freedom of the soul.

Vanishing Point is directed by Richard Sarafian and written by Guillermo Cain. It stars Barry Newman, Cleavon Little and Dean. Jagger.

Car delivery driver Kowalski (Newman) tasks himself to get a Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco in a seemingly impossible time. His journey will see him constantly pursued by the police and come into contact with a number of interesting characters.

By definition a cult film, Vanishing Point baffled many a critic upon its release but continues to gain fans as each decade passes. It operates out of the counterculture sphere of film making that surfaced in the late 60s and early 70s. On the surface it's a very simple picture, the speedster aspect of the car chases appear to render it as purely a car junkie thrill piece. Yet much conjecture and analysis has occurred over the years to give it mythical status, with some maintaining it's a masterpiece of a message movie. It certainly has an ethereal quality about it, to the point where those invested in more than just the brilliant car stunts et al will find themselves beguiled by Sarafian's tantalising piece.

Kowalski doesn't say much, even as he meets odd people and ends up in odd situations, this positions him as a true cinematic anti hero. His backstory is revealed to us in flashbacks, so we do get to know about him, understand where his skills came from and why his psychological make up is the way it is. His contact with the real world as it were, is via a blind radio DJ known as Super Soul (Cleavon Little excellent), who Sarafian has smartly put up as an almost physic companion during Kowalski's journey, with him crucially warning of policeman perils. It's one of a number of intriguing shards in a fascinating movie. The makers have remained vague as to exactly what everything in the film means, which is fine, for this is a picture that each individual viewer should decipher as they see fit.

Owners Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus had loftier ambitions: They wanted a blockbuster; a big-budget smash that they could call their own. To this end, they signed director Tobe Hooper to a three-picture deal and turned him loose with $25,000,000 and free reign to create the movie he wanted. Working with a stellar, mostly British cast (save token American star Steve Railsback, who apparently misplaced his charisma at Heathrow; and startlingly uninhibited French goddess Mathilda May); legendary composer Henry Mancini; and a screenplay co-written by the man who wrote ALIEN (1979), Hooper unleashed a wonderfully unwieldy miasma of genres. What starts out as a science fiction mystery gradually morphs into full blown, zombie apocalypse horror - played with square-jawed seriousness by all involved. Unfortunately, this film got lost among that years' heavy-hitters like BACK TO THE FUTURE and the second RAMBO film, and earned back less than half its budget.

11954,"Lifeforce is the best Dracula from Space movie I’ve ever seen. I haven’t seen that many, mind you, and Vampirella and Dracula 3000 sure as shit didn’t set that particular bar especially high; on the other hand, Lifeforce is better-looking than many sci-fi/fantasy films released as recently as this the year of Our Lord 2022, vis-a-vis practical, mechanical special effects versus CGI and motion capture visual effects (it doesn’t hurt Lifeforce either that there’s generous full-frontal female nudity courtesy of French uber-babe Mathilda May). 

The script is not without its share of silliness (consider this piece of dialogue: ""Sir, we've found a naked girl in Hyde park. The body is in an indescribable condition"" — but you just kind of described it, didn’t you? I mean, ""a naked girl"" is a reasonably specific description), but the movie’s weak spot lies in a deliberate choice: comparing the plot’s events to the ""vampires of legend,"" which the film’s quasi-Van Helsing eventually concludes ""came from creatures such as these. Perhaps even from these very creatures."" 

Somehow it never occurs to Dr. Fallada (Frank Finlay) to wonder, if ""these very creatures"" needed an astronaut to bring them to Earth in his space shuttle, how the ""vampires of legend"" arrived in our planet the first time around. How the good doctor correctly guessed that a ""leaded metal shaft, penetrating not through the heart, but through the energy center two inches below the heart [how he knows so much about the creatures’ anatomy is anybody’s guess, considering the things human form is but a disguise]. Not steel, but leaded iron"" (he calls this the ""old way,"" but wouldn’t that be a wooden stake through the heart?) would prove fatal to the aliens is another secret I’m afraid he takes to his grave. There is also some mumbo-jumbo about how ""The process of conversion
releases a life energy"" that ""can be collected ... The male vampire's collecting life energy. But he has to send it through her to get it up to the collector"" and some other such nonsense.

The filmmakers should have treated the word ""vampire"" as anathema, and avoid any and all direct references to it. Take for instance the aforementioned space shuttle, which anyone familiar with Bram Stoker will identify as an allusion to the Demeter; this is a clever little touch, but it won’t impede any viewer’s enjoyment of the film if the parallelism escapes them. 

My point is that you don’t have to be the boy who cried vampire when the thought is already in pretty much everybody’s mind. There are shades of other works here (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Night of the Living Dead, Solaris, and even Ghostbusters), but the movie doesn’t feel the need to overtly draw attention to them — so why the hard-on for vampires? Other than that, Lifeforce is a satisfying minor diversion for fans of old-school horror.",5.0

It ain't easy having pals.

Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way.

Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing.

Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10",8.0

However, this film is also worthwhile for some other reasons as well. The western has always been a consistently popular genre and after watching this film you can immediately understand why.

It's the latter activity that convinces these two along with ""Bryce"" (Scott Caan) and ""Amanda"" (Ashley Scott) that their fortunes could be made. Snag is, you can't just raise tons of ancient booty from the sea bed and sail into harbour with it. What's this to do with drugs?

Initially wanting nothing to do with it, they later conclude that they ought to try and sell it - and that brings them into conflict with ""Bates"" (Josh Brolin) who wants to have his cake and eat it! As the pace quickens, there now ensues loads of action-packed shenanigans in and out of the water.

Brolin makes for quite a decent baddy, Caan - well he probably ought to be called Caan't, and the two on the poster show us that beautiful people still have a place on the small screen.",6.0
11969,"Indeed, sir. The last charge of Wyatt Earp and his immortals. 

Tombstone is written by Kevin Jarre and directed by its star Kurt Russell, with credited director George P. Cosmatos ghost-directing. It also features a large ensemble cast that includes Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn & Powers Boothe. The movie is loosely based on historic incidents occurring in 1881-1882. The plot follows newly retired peace officer Wyatt Earp (Russell) as he and his two brothers, Virgil (Elliott) & Morgan (Paxton), arrive in the Tuscon town of Tombstone. Here they plan to make their fortune and gain themselves a share in a farrow game at the local saloon. Wyatt's long time friend, Doc Holliday (Kilmer), also joins the Earp's in town and it's not long before they encounter trouble in the form of The Cowboys - a ruthless bunch of outlaws led by Curly Bill Brocious (Boothe).

The back story to Tombstone is rather interesting, so without waffling on and boring the spurs off of any readers I'll try & keep this paragraph short! Willem Dafoe was slated to star as Doc Holliday but Buena Vista (Disney company) said no way on account of his appearance in the frowned upon The Last Temptation Of Christ. Since Buena Vista were the only company willing to distribute Tombstone, on account of Kevin Costner pulling rank and influence due to his own Wyatt Earp movie being on the go, they had the big say in things. Then when the screenplay was turned in by Jarre it was shot down by both Russell and the now on board Kilmer because it was deemed excessively too long. Jarre was then fired as director for refusing to cut down the characterisations. Enter Cosmatos to ghost-direct for Russell. Then Robert Mitchum (who narrates in the film) had to drop out of playing Old Man Clanton (subsequently dropped from the story) due to a riding accident. While genre legend Glenn Ford bailed out of playing Marshall White to pave the way for Harry Carey Junior to fill those boots.

In spite of all the problems getting harmony and cohesion to the screen, Tombstone ends up being a thoroughly entertaining genre piece. A love letter to the genre and boasting one of the best ever portrayals of an (in)famous Western character (Kilmer's take on Holliday is sexy, dangerous and utterly beguiling). Comparing it to Costner's movie is folly, for that movie (and I'm a big fan of it) is a telling of Earp's life and doesn't Hollywoodise things, this is about a short period in Earp's life, with bells on. There's some inaccuracies, but in the main the makers do a good job of covering the events leading up to the famous gunfight that occurred at the O.K. Corall - and the aftermath of said confrontation. Pic manages to have its cake and to eat it for a modern age made Western. It does all in all what old fans of the genre expect whilst having enough savvy dialogue and rah rah sequences to engage the more youthful viewers. There's not much art to speak of (for instance you wont go searching out for the cinematographer's name) and the sheer volume of characters at times threatens to bulge the piece over the belt buckle. Yet it always manages to keep us entertained with a high energy action sequence or a sharp quip delivered by the irrepressible Kilmer. Even the standardised romantic angle involving the beautiful, but superfluous Dana Delaney as Josephine manages to have its engaging moments. Sure we ache for the next scene of Kilmer being cool or Biehn being a cocky bastard, but the love blossoming between Wyatt & Josephine, and the inner conflict that it causes Earp, really fleshes out where Earp was emotionally at a time when he was trying to settle down for peace in his world.

Ultimately it's probably with the story of Kilmer & Russell insisting on a trimming of the story that Tombstone makes the most telling point. Critically it was recognised as being too bloated and that wasn't what was needed. For crying out loud the Western fan had had Eastwood's sublime Unforgiven the previous year, so who in their right mind would try and follow that? Tombstone thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously, but still it has enough nous to keep the beans cooking on high and the splendid moustache's a twirling. All that Whilst simultaneously providing some of the most quotable lines delivered in the most splendid of film genres. Kilmer's Doc is our Huckleberry, and so is Tombstone the film. 8/10",8.0
11969,"**A very well done western, which replaces glorification with raw realism.**

I really enjoyed this film, which is very centered on the notable figures of Wyatt Earp, Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp and Doc Holiday during their time as law and order in the town of Tombstone. In popular culture, they became famous due to a short but intense exchange of fire with a group of gunmen from the city, called the Ok Corral Shooting. The incident, which took place in October 1881, was widely romanticized in the early 20th century and became a symbol of the Old West.

In fact, the shooting, which appears in this film, was just one violent incident within a long feud between the sheriffs and the gunmen. The causes are still shrouded in mists that historians are trying, with difficulty, to penetrate, and the feud continued and resulted in the murder of one of the Earp brothers and the pursuit and death of some of the assassins, in a veritable manhunt. I'm a historian, but I'm not an expert on the period or the Wild West, but I felt that the film managed to put everything in its context and respect, minimally, what really happened.

If there is something in this film that deserves to be highlighted, it is the work of the actors. We have a magnificent cast, full of very competent actors who committed themselves to their respective roles. The effort deserves our praise. Of course, Kurt Russel will have a special highlight when receiving the character of Wyatt Earp, but the actor made good use of that role and managed to be very charismatic and friendly to the public. Sam Elliott, one of those veterans with a lot of attitude and personality, couldn't be better and is incredibly good in this film. Maybe it's the actor's best film. Val Kilmer is not one of those actors that makes me want to see a movie, but the truth is that he was also very good at his job, and managed to harmonize his character's fragility and charisma well.

Directed by Kevin Jarre and George Cosmatos, the film is one of those westerns that went against the classics by dismantling the glorified figure of the cowboy, the bravery and coldness of the gunslinger and the villain, and giving a more realistic and historically credible flavor to films of this genre. The script is very good, it is very well written, and the technical work of the visual effects, make-up, costumes and set design teams was truly exquisite. The cinematography does not let us down either and makes very clever use of all this, and the sets and exterior footage, with magnificent lighting and a warm color palette that is simply delightful. The soundtrack, despite not being memorable or worthy of particular attention, does a good job.",10.0
11969,"There is something really quite authentic looking about this western. Set at a time when the law was beginning to seriously impose itself on the otherwise lawless ""wild"" west, it depicts the story of Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) who just wanted to retire to peace and quiet in the eponymous Arizona town. Once there, he quickly realises that his fellow townsfolk are not on the same page. The arrival of his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott), Morgan (Bill Paxton) and his lifelong friend ""Doc"" Holliday (Val Kilmer) make a confrontation with the red-sashed ""cowboys"" inevitable. This film takes it's time to develop the characters and the narrative. That's not say it is dull, it isn't - it just allows the story to breathe as the tension mounts before culminating in the legendary gunfight at the OK Corral. Russell was maybe not the best choice (though at times he reminded me of Gene Hackman); but Kilmer was oddly effective as was Stephen Lang's pretty duplicitous Ike Clanton. It's narrated by one Hollywood legend - Robert Mitchum, and features the briefest of cameos at the end from another - Charlton Heston, is well constructed and paced, and rather creatively, poignantly (and violently at times) depicts the end of an era.",7.0

James Woods, Danny DeVito and Rip Torn all give noteworthy performances in the roles of Hades, Phil and Zeus. However, Tate Donovan as the titular character is forgettable, as is Roger Bart's voice when Hercules sings.

Bart isn't helped by the very average music, none of which is memorable to me. The plot is mild, one that is quite easy to predict and doesn't produce any thrilling moments. The animation is actually OK, satisfactory for sure.

It is a fun take on the Herculean mythology of ancient Greece. Beginning with a suitably grand opening narrative from Charlton Heston, no less, we learn that Hades is desperate to avenge himself on Zeus - who tricked him into ruling the underworld after he and his brothers defeated the Titans. Meantime Zeus is celebrating the birth of a baby boy. Hades decides to strike back, but his augurs (the ""Fates"" but think more ""Stygian witches"") advise that this little boy - Hercules - is the fly in the ointment who must be neutralised if his grand design is to succeed. Hades tricks him firstly into mortality and then cons him out of his great strength - but will that be enough to defeat the determination of our hero? It is a bit of a slow starter; but once it gets into the swing there are some good performances from James Woods (superb as Hades), Rip Torn (Zeus) and Danny DeVito as the long-suffering demi-god trainer ""Phil"" that keep this fantasy adventure moving along nicely.

11971,"For Kenneth Branagh's 4th film he chose to return to The Bard that brought him here.  He chose Shakespeare's farcical comedy **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING**.  I knew one thing going in... Shakespeare's comedies are rarely that funny.  I knew something better coming out.. I could not have been more wrong. This film is not only funny and sexy, it is a treasure.

This is the first Branagh film that he utilizes stunt casting - bringing in Hollywood talent into  roles normally filled by Shakespearian actors.  And while it isn't always perfect, there is no complaint.  In fact Michael Keaton, Keanu Reeves and Denzel Washington shine some bright light toward the American talent pool.  Of course, many of Kenneth's _'Shakespeare'_ friends are still along for the ride - Brian Blessed is amongst my favorites.

Branagh's first major achievement with this film is on his screenplay treatment.  Like his **HENRY V**, he has cut the screenplay down to a much more manageable Hollywood film length. It is taut and efficient. Nothing is missing for the casual Shakespeare fan. Of course the obsessed will find - or _won't_ find a lot of stuff.

Branagh's second major achievement is shared by others in the cast, especially Emma Thompson.  Their handle of the language and poetry of Shakespeare shifts what is often muddy and confusing dialogue to crystal clear and modern understanding.  In fact you will find yourself smiling through most of their scenes together as they torture each other until their love takes over.

In high school readings of any Shakespeare plays, students often get confused as to the social aspect of the stories... They would question why there is a party and why is everyone in the town celebrating it? Why do battles seem to be fought and won amongst only 10 soldiers? Why does it seem that marriages are performed on the same day that the couple first met?  So many questions confuse students and the adults who grow from them.  Branagh's most masterful achievement here is in answering these questions.
 
During his **HENRY V**, Branagh used an incredibly impressive tracking shot through the death and destruction on the field of Agincourt.  Just as impressive is the finale of **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING**, including the audience in the celebration moving through the community and finally, up into the sky with a grand view of the love and excitement of all that are alive to experience it.

It is obvious that Kenneth Branagh is a major fan of Shakespeare.  I would venture to say that he is more than a fan, he is an artistic peer.",10.0
11972,"Fernandel is great in this comedy drama set after the end of the Second World War in Italy. He's the eponymous churchman who is watching his country at a crossroads between the old and the new ways of thinking. The town has just elected a communist mayor, nicknamed ""Peppone"" (Gino Cervi) and it seems that just about everyone barring himself and the town's former school mistress ""Cristina"" (Sylvie) is supporting the new regime. The two men spar like rutting stags, with the former using his considerable array of church bells to drown out his rival's political speechifying and the latter doing whatever he can to thwart the priest's dreams of establishing a garden for the poor - of which there are quite a few! Luckily, we have an invisible narrator for this exercise who adopts a god-like position on the shoulder of ""Camillo"" reminding him to live to the vows he took to his church despite his inclination for fisticuffs and disputations with just about everyone, but that is becoming much harder when rumours of some Nazi cash reach his ears and he wants some of it for his project. The mayor wants to build an edifice to demonstrate the power of the people and their new found freedoms, and that's what he wants to do with the reportedly 10 million Lire. Can they compromise? What's becomes clear to us is that there is a lot of bravado going on here, and when it comes down to it the two men are actually remarkably and stubbornly similar. They both want what's best for their village, their congregation/electorate and both are conscious that this is a delicate time for their nation and co-operation is going to be vital, even if it's grudgingly given. The novel from Giovanni Guareschi upon which this is based offers quite a gentle analysis of post-war, and soon to be post-kingdom, Italy and looks at the roles of the church and it's traditions in a subtly thought-provoking fashion. Director Julien Duvivier has managed to capture quite a bit of that thrust and incorporates it engagingly into a series of scenarios that do raise a smile, but also an eyebrow too.

Yes it's talky, of course it is, but these conversations are real and riveting. And while there's not a duff performance in the acting pack, Bruce Greenwood deserves special praise. He is the leader, the fulcrum, there's not a false note by him, JFK becoming the role he was born to play.

Do we really sound that exaggerated to them?

Who cares, ignore the above, it's still a good movie... despite Costner's accent.  Or, possibly, in spite of it.

It trashes Dean Achenson, and as a historian the only thing I like to see MORE than Dean getting his just deserts is Allen Dulles getting his... and it throws a jab at that a**hole too.  In 2000 that would have been seen as pure liberal honesty, but now it sort of comes across as far right.  I mean the movie is literally about avoiding Nuclear War with Russia as the entire Democratic party and the progressive movement seem to want to push us closer and closer to it.

It's one of the better political films you can see, and it builds the pressure to the point where you are terrified that the world could end despite the fact it has long come and gone.

11975,"‘Good lawyer’ is not an oxymoron

RELEASED IN 1997 and written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola based on John Grisham’s book, ""The Rainmaker"" stars Matt Damon as an idealistic newbie lawyer in Memphis who takes on a fraudulent insurance company with Danny DeVito as his paralegal and Claire Danes an abused potential love interest. Jon Voight plays the lead lawyer for the insurance company and Roy Scheider the CEO of the corporation.

Beyond Coppola’s renowned expertise, the cast is stellar, which also includes Mickey Rourke as a smooth legal mogul, Virginia Madsen as a witness and Dean Stockwell & Danny Glover as judges. This was Damon’s break out role as a leading man, paving the way for hits like “Good Will Hunting” (1998) and “Saving Private Ryan” (1998). He’s affable as the principled young lawyer and I liked the way the movie discreetly shows his new home life with the elderly lady, plus other budding relationships.

This is decidedly a drama with many courtroom scenes, so don’t except the thrills of other Grisham-based films, like the excellent “The Firm” (1993) and action-packed “The Pelican Brief” (1993), although there is an intense action sequence in the second half. While the first half confidently take its time with the drama, throwing in moments of realistic amusement, it segues into a compelling third act. Furthermore, “The Rainmaker” is a must for anyone interested in the good, the bad and the ugly of the legal arena in America.

The movie made $46 million domestically from a budget of $40 million (not including revenue from other countries), but it was still considered a disappoint in comparison to “The Firm,” which cost roughly the same amount and made six times as much at the box office. Coppola subsequently took a decade break from directing before reentering the fray with the inscrutable “Youth Without Youth” (2007).

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes and was shot in the Memphis area of Tennessee, as well as Cleveland, Ohio and California (Alameda, Oakland, San Francisco).

11975,"The Rainmaker is a compelling legal drama that showcases Francis Ford Coppola's return to form after the less successful Jack. Adapted from John Grisham's novel, the film follows Rudy Baylor, a novice attorney portrayed by Matt Damon, as he takes on a powerful insurance company in a wrongful death lawsuit. While the case's outcome may seem predictable, the narrative remains engaging, keeping viewers invested throughout.

Matt Damon delivers a strong performance, capturing Rudy's earnestness and determination. 1997 was indeed a significant year for Damon, with Good Will Hunting also releasing, further establishing his presence in Hollywood. The supporting cast, including Danny DeVito as Deck Shifflet and Jon Voight as the opposing attorney, adds depth and nuance to the story.

Coppola's direction brings a grounded realism to the film, focusing on the intricacies of the legal process and the moral dilemmas faced by the characters. The courtroom scenes are particularly well-executed, balancing tension and drama effectively. With Coppola's direction and the performances, The Rainmaker is notably one of the better adaptations of Grisham's work.

Despite its strengths, The Rainmaker didn't achieve significant box office success, grossing $45.9 million domestically against a $40 million budget. However, it received generally positive reviews.

11978,"Men of Honor is one of those films that hits hard with its message, yet somehow got a mixed reception from critics who called it too conventional. But honestly, what’s wrong with a movie sticking to a classic, inspiring formula when it’s done right? The story of Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., is all about perseverance, dignity, and refusing to let others define your worth. Robert De Niro, as the tough and unpredictable Master Chief Billy Sunday, brings an intensity that elevates every scene he's in. Their dynamic is what makes the movie so gripping, showing how respect is earned through resilience and action, not just words.

The script carries some powerful lines, but the standout moment for me is when Carl confidently fires back, ""You're damn right I am!"" That single line encapsulates everything the movie stands for. It’s not just about race or breaking barriers, but about proving to yourself and the world that you belong where you’ve worked hard to be. The cinematography and production keep things grounded, never feeling overly dramatic, which makes the emotional beats hit even harder. The pacing might feel a bit slow in places, but it gives enough breathing room for the character arcs to feel earned rather than rushed.

Overall, Men of Honor is an inspiring watch, especially if you appreciate stories about overcoming adversity without unnecessary fluff or exaggeration. Gooding Jr. delivers one of his best performances, and De Niro balances toughness with subtle layers of respect and mentorship. It’s a movie that deserved more credit than it got and remains a solid reminder of how persistence and belief in yourself can break down any obstacle.",8.0

Walken, of course, gets top billing, and he did do a very good job, who doesn't love it when he's a villein? He is always delightfully creepy and, in The Prophecy he balances that creepiness with a healthy does of humor. It makes him a lovable character, but then he does have a great sense of humor and one of the best deadpan deliveries in modern Hollywood.

Still...Elias Koteas. I don't think he means to do it, but he always takes center stage in whatever he does and The Prophecy is no different. The man just brings his A-game to every movie, every bit part he has ever played. And like his turn in Fallen, the one thing that lingers in your memory when the movie is over, is the Koteas performance. As usual he wields raw acting power with ease.

Stolz, as always, plays Eric Stoltz, but in this movie it works perfectly. He is the angel just following orders, and one that positively stinks of 90s era cool. You know from the first time you see him on screen that he was the perfect casting choice for Simon.

What makes it better is Adam Goldberg, the man that is always cast in the same sort of roles. That is the slightly dorky Jew. He's really the same character he was in Saving Private Ryan, only far more pathetic. But he also provides the comic relief as a walking, decaying, reanimated corpse forced back to life to be Walken's unwilling and lippy servant. The movie needed elements of relief to keep it grounded enough to appeal to the none Biblically inclined and Goldberg, well, he does his job and makes you laugh.

What you have here is a small film with a small budget and a great cast and it works.

There are no two without three, and after two films, a third was made to finish a trilogy that had already begun to derail in the second film. This film, in fact, was a desperate effort to recover from the bad step, but it ended up definitively burying any vain idea of a future fourth film. The film is weak, and if we compare it to its predecessors, it becomes even more tiring. The biggest problem is an erratic and poorly written script, but the weak and naked jokes also detract from the film, which never really captures our interest.

At the same time, they decide to adopt a street dog, who is the main protagonist of this film, and who will start talking to Samantha's poodle, in a funny rivalry relationship. As in any romantic comedy, it is predictable that everything will end well, between several twists and turns.

There's a great deal of nudity but after about five minutes that is, as so often happens in European cinema, subsumed into a story that is characterful and strong. It does suggest love, lust and joy, but latterly it begins to suggest something else - a vulnerability.

I didn't have very high expectations when I decided to see this movie. I knew that it was a film set in a future that, for us, is now past (the year 2017) and that it was yet another film about a prison break. I also knew that it had been a success in Europe, especially on the VHS market, and that it had been forgotten since the end of the tapes and no one was talking about it anymore. So, I decided to take a look, see if it was worth it, and I liked what I saw. It is a creative film, made by people with ideas and the ability to come up with imaginative solutions, based on a competent cast, and which made good use of its short budget.

The script takes us to a high-security prison, built underground in the United States desert, in order to accompany a couple who have just been arrested for trying to have a second child, something prohibited by the “one-child policy” then in effect. strength in the USA. Sentenced to the outrageous sentence of 31 years in prison, they are placed inside that place, where everything is controlled by a computer and depends on a vicious and sadistic director, and on the computer system itself, which sometimes seems to have a life of its own. Even the dreams of these inmates are controlled and censored via a mechanism installed in the gut, and that could kill them if they step over the risk (literally).

The script has a serious problem: it is based on an old premise that is prison escapes. We've seen a lot of them already, because almost every great fugue in history has been adapted for the screen in some way. However, the film tries to get around the problem with doses of imagination and creativity that futurism accepts well. The graphic violence of some scenes can also bother some people, but I think I've even seen worse. But be warned: we have everything from exploding intestines to half-human androids with a misshapen appearance. There is an investment in visual effects, special effects, make-up, quality sets and costumes, and this investment has paid off. Unfortunately, the cinematography is not very good, it is even below the standard of the time the film was made, but I coped well with it.

Stuart Gordon gives the film a well-executed, effective direction, managing to take full advantage of what he has to work with. Christopher Lambert, the eternal McLeod, is in excellent shape here and does a solid job, even if the role is simple and effortless. Kurtwood Smith is an efficient villain, cold and worthy of our contempt, but he also provokes some sympathy for his quest for a certain warmth that his character has lost. Loryn Locklin is also a welcome addition, but I felt several times that the character had little to do and was limited to being a damsel in distress. Tom Towles, Clifton Collins Jr., Vernon Wells, Jeffrey Combs and Lincoln Kilpatrick provide effective support, but they can do no more.",5.0

12095,"From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money had the deck stacked against it, not only because it is a sequel, but because of the movie to which it is a sequel. What in the original was an unforeseeable surprise becomes expectation here, and we’re left simply waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

Having said that, this film is better than it has any right to be, precisely because it knows how dumb it is. An old band of bank robbers is getting back together for one more score, which they insist on carrying out even after most of them have been turned into vampires; this would only make sense if it were a blood bank. 

To its credit, Texas Blood Money is not oblivious to the situation’s inherent silliness; when asked ""What in the hell are vampires doing robbing a bank?,"" protagonist Buck Bowers (the always effective Robert Patrick) deadpans: ""I suppose vampires need money just like anybody else.""

Insofar as the movie works, it does so because of the cast, who bring to the script more than it brings them. The filmmakers try too hard to emulate Tarantino and Robert Rodríguez at the peak of their powers, and can’t even reach the low levels to which those have sunk nowadays.

12096,"**A decent film, which has what it takes to entertain us minimally, but which is still far from the quality we would like to see.**

After many years dormant, the ""Pink Panther"" franchise was entitled to a very brief resurrection with two films starring Steve Martin. I saw the original films, from the 60s, 70s and 80s, in which Peter Sellers played the infamous Inspector Clouseau. With the death of Sellers, the franchise continued, with some absolutely bad films that dictated its end. This new film was heavily criticized by critics and was not able to give the public everything they wanted, but the truth is that it was a box office success and that, even today, it has the right to recurring exhibitions on TV channels, something that the original movies don't have it anymore.

The choice of Steve Martin for the protagonist, I believe, was quite wise, insofar as the actor knew how to do a job that respects and seeks to honor the legacy of Sellers (an actor that Martin himself admitted that he admired a lot). Martin is good at what he does, and he's a well-known comic actor, but the humor he bets on is more predictable and idiotic than Sellers' humor, and the truth is, he's not particularly funny. Jean Reno was a welcome addition, as the actor is quite comfortable with the role and the kind of humor that is reserved for him. Emily Mortimer works very well as a platonic love interest. I found her much funnier than the protagonist himself. Kevin Kline doesn't work very well as Dreyfus: the actor gave him a seriousness that takes away all the fun. In turn, Beyoncé seems to have been chosen only for her physical beauty and ability to mobilize her fans to see the film. She can't play a character, she's just being herself.

The screenplay is part of the problem with this film, with a far-fetched and rocambolesque story in which the pink diamond is stolen almost in plain sight, shortly after the death of its owner, a famous football coach. The story is simply weak and unappealing. And while the cinematography is decent, the filming locations are well-chosen and well-used, and the animated opening credits are pretty well done, the rest limps a lot: editing and visual effects work are the film's weak points, the pacing seems uneven and unbalanced and the soundtrack seems to be limited to a series of variations on top of the leitmotif given by the tone of Mancini's original music.",5.0

To what extent can a simple social story and a familiar family problem such as separation or divorce. To what extent can it represent and reflect the condition of an entire society, the culture and morals of this society, and the social changes that occur to it. The events of the film tell about the story of the divorce and struggle of the Kramer couple over the custody of their child, which reflected in its essence the social and cultural change in American society during the seventies of the last century.

In 1979, the American social film Kramer vs. Kramer This film won good reviews, including an Academy Award. It is a reflection of the changes that took place in the family and in women's choices after widespread demands and protest movements in the United States of America in the sixties of the last century. Part of these demands was related to the call for women's liberation and the struggle for equality.

After the round of conflict, the woman came out strong, and a measure of her rights were taken away. She also became economically independent and self-reliant, and the door of her ambitions was wide open, and she turned from a subordinate to an equal. Certainly, all these changes had to find their reflection on people's daily lives, on the woman's relationship with the man, and on the arrangement of women's priorities in terms of family and life, as yesterday the family was at the top of the list of American women's priorities, but after this cultural and social transformation, we see that the ambition of some women as Kramer's wife It is what settles at the top of her priorities now.

And as the wife Kramer is the strongest and most economically able, she takes custody of the son from the father without regard to whether this behavior is in the best interests of the son or not.

I was affected by what Kramer's wife did, which is that she was faced with two difficult choices, either to take care of the son, or to continue what she had achieved in her work. Unfortunately, it was prescribed for a woman to sacrifice everything.",7.0
12102,"Much more heart than expected!

<em>'Kramer vs. Kramer'</em> is a film I've heard of for as long as I can remember, though I didn't actually know much about it itself... a quick glance at Wikipedia and I saw that they class it as a ""legal drama"", which is obvious given the title. With that, I was waiting for a long court battle to start so was surprised to see it not arrive until the final 30 or so minutes. The film is actually mainly about a father and son, in how they react to a certain life event.

And boy do the filmmakers do a great job at making you care for the characters of Dustin Hoffman (Ted) and Justin Henry (Billy)... and even Meryl Streep's Joanna, though I could've personally done with more development for the latter's character; especially as the ending is quite predictable, so additional scenes for her side of the story would've been nice. I wouldn't say it's a big deal, however, as you see what's needed.

Hoffman puts in a terrific performance, as does youngster Henry. Streep also brings a good showing, as do Jane Alexander and Howard Duff more minimally. Credit to everyone onscreen, in truth. It's, of course, sad to read about the offscreen incident(s) that occurred during the production involving Hoffman and Streep, albeit settled incident(s) between the two.

12104,"**Pink Floyd's music works on its own. As a film, it's a waste of time.**

I don't know if Pink Floyd were aware of the impact that “The Wall” would have when they released it. Today, there is some consensus in considering it one of the best rock albums ever and “Another Brick in the Wall” has become an anthem for teenage rebellion, which does not conform to the rules, dictates and conventions. And I feel free to say all this because rock is not, by any stretch of the imagination, one of my personal preference styles of music. I listen, casually, but I wouldn't pay for a ticket.

What this film does, essentially, is to take the concept of the album – which was designed and released as if it were a kind of opera-rock – and give it a look to match in an absolutely dreamlike, hallucinated style. There is no plot other than the one that goes on in the head of the protagonist, the rock vocalist Pink, who seems to be experiencing a very deep depression, as his social and emotional isolation increases, caused by an absent father (he died in the war when he was a child), an overprotective mother, a series of abusive teachers and a recent divorce.

Watching the film is like watching a musical nightmare. It's not an optimistic film, and it's not easy to watch, especially because the plot isn't very obvious and there are no explanations. There are several impactful scenes, so I don't know if it's the most suitable film for impressionable audiences. There are many fantasies about war, about power and using power to control others. There are also some good animated scenes, although they are just as disturbing as all the others. However, the film is just that... and Pink Floyd's music. The film will certainly please fans of the band, and rock lovers in general, but other audiences may think it doesn't justify their time.",2.0
12106,"Nice try from Raimi, but ultimately it creeps just above average.

The Western is a tough genre to tackle in the modern age, more so when it's post Dances With Wolves and  Unforgiven's masterclasses 101. But tackling both these challenges is nothing to the one which director Sam Raimi asks of the audience in his stab at the genre. 

A female gunslinger is here played by a Hollywood beauty, Sharon Stone, but she isn't right for the lead role. She obviously looks gorgeous and she broods and pouts better than most of her modern day peers, but she lacks a menacing streak, a bit of believable nastiness that just might have lifted the film to better heights. We understand and expect the vulnerability she shows, but to succeed here in the testosterone fuelled town of Redemption, she's going to have to convince as a tough gal. And Stone just isn't up to the task.

The film does have good points to enjoy though, very much so. The story, although gimmicky, works well as an entertaining popcorn munching tale, while the cast list reads like a whose who of solid and quality thespers,  (Gene Hackman wandering in from Unforgiven to play Little Bill's ghost, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DeCaprio, Keith David, Pat Hingle & Lance Henriksen). Also into the plus column is the always impressive cinematography from Dante Spinotti, and there is no denying Sam Raimi's keen eye for detail, with his zooming shots a real treat during the shoot out sequences - his Spaghetti Western leanings further enhanced by Alan Silvestri's pasta influenced score.

12106,"Now I saw this in the cinema in 1995 and had somehow managed to completely forget all about it - until I saw it again just last week and realised why. It's not that it is awful, it's just that it is so very derivative and very, very dependant on Gene Hackman (""Herod"") who walks a fine line between menace and ham in a none too convincing fashion. He is running a to-the-death gun slinging competition - almost like one of the chivalric jousts of old - with the winner having to face him in the final shoot-out for an huge poke. Sharon Stone (""Ellen"") arrives in his dingy town just at the start of the process determined to avenge her father's killer; Russell Crowe is ""Cort"", a preacher who also has a pretty violent past and ""the Kid"" (Leonardo di Caprio) who has the clear belief that his youth and skill make him all but immortal are all coaxed, cajoled and threatened into participating in this game of death. Sam Raimi has all the ingredients of a great little western adventure, but the cast don't work well together at all. Stone is well past her potent best and the usual guy-with-a-grudge theme is now so hackneyed as to render this little better than a series of gunfights with characters about whom I could not care less. The cinematography and some of the photographic styles are interesting, though - the film has a classy look to it and Alan Silvestri creates some tension with his slightly untypical (for a western) score; but the whole is nowhere near the sum of the parts leaving us with something that now, more than ever, just looks like it's been made for telly.",6.0
12106,"**_Mythic Western about a quick-draw contest in a town with an all-star cast_**

Sharon Stone stars as a grim, nonchalant woman who, curiously, enters a dueling contest in a remote Southwest desert town ""ruled"" by outlaw Herod (Gene Hackman). A pacifist preacher is forced by Herod to participate in the contest, but he ain't no conventional minister (Russell Crowe). Other notables include: Leonardo DiCaprio, Lance Henriksen, Tobin Bell, Keith David, Gary Sinise and Pat Hingle.

""The Quick and the Dead"" (1995) was co-produced by Stone and she was responsible for getting the youthful & skinny DiCaprio in the cast, she even paid his salary (?!). Stone also apprehended New Zealander Crowe with this being his first American feature. When dressed in her tight leather pants Sharon was unable to sit down (lol). Interestingly, she fired her hottie stand-in because she was getting more attention from the crew on set (!). She later confessed that Crowe was her favorite on screen kisser, but kissing DiCaprio was like kissing her arm (lol).

The tone is mythic in the manner of those spaghetti Westerns of the 60s, but with superior production values and obviously seminal to Tarantino Westerns (""Django Unchained"" and ""The Hateful Eight""). While the vibe isn't exactly realistic, the cast members take the material seriously and ham it up with gusto. You can tell they all had a great time. The movie's town bound and comic booky with larger-than-life characters, but it's not campy or comedic, although it's somewhat silly.

The film's title is presumably taken from 1 Peter 4:5 of the KJV translation of the Bible, which details how Christ ""is ready to judge the quick and the dead."" The phrase also appears in the Apostle's Creed with the same meaning. In both cases 'quick' is an Old English term for ""living."" The movie's title clearly plays off both the modern and archaic meanings in that there are two kinds of gunfighters in the Old West: those who are quick (that is, fast and alive) and those who are dead.

It's STILL at least 50,000 times funnier than Lena Dunham's 'Tiny Furniture' (or about 70% of the so-called contemporary American comedies made these days).",7.0
12110,"**Nielsen has done better, but this movie is good enough to be enjoyable and mildly funny.**

This comedy, starring Leslie Nielsen and intelligently directed by Mel Brooks, is truly good. It is a parody of old horror movies, in which Dracula is an aristocratic undead who lives off the blood of unsuspecting humans. The film is more directly inspired by the old productions of Hammer Studios and Francis Ford Coppola's _Dracula_, which was still recent when the film was released. The script is, therefore, similar in every way to the last film I mentioned.

Nielsen is perfectly capable of putting up with the film effortlessly, with a generous dose of good humor, charisma and spirit. The actor is a veteran of cinema comedies and satire, we've seen him before in very funny films, and the actor does well here again. However, I can agree with those who say that the actor has done better works. In addition to directing, Brooks gives life to Van Helsing and is also resourceful and witty, with a relatively flawless work, but also without major merits. Much better than Brooks was Peter MacNicol's excellent performance in the role of Renfield. The actor is good, and he seems genuinely deranged. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony do what they can, but they're not particularly happy, because their characters don't really matter here.

Being a film that takes place in the Victorian England, it is possible that Brooks gave the cast instructions to try to Britishize their accents. However, such an effort rarely resulted in any happy results, not to mention the jokes, who didn't always work well, with several scenes sounding overly serious or dull. The sets, as well as the costumes, are good enough, and I didn't find any major problems with the question of the historical period. The regular cinematography, the satisfying but not brilliant editing and the relatively lukewarm soundtrack complete the production values ​​of the film, which is far from being really good, but it turned out to be interesting, funny and good enough for us to bear watching it again.",7.0
12110,"**_Amusing parody of Dracula with Leslie Nielsen, Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman_**

“Dracula: Dead and Loving It” (1995) is a Mel Brooks spoof of the Dracula story with the same fun style and goofy humor of “Young Frankenstein” (1974) and “Spaceballs” (1987). Unlike ""Love at First Bite"" (1979) with George Hamilton, the story doesn’t take place in the modern day, but is basically a silly redo of the first half of “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992) along with bits from other Dracula flicks.

With Nielsen as the protagonist, you can’t help but think of The Naked Gun movies. Meanwhile Steven Weber is effective as Harker and Peter MacNicol hams it up as Renfield.

The presence of the stunning Amy Yasbeck brings to mind Brooks’ previous film, “Robin Hood: Men in Tights” (1993. Along with Amy, Lysette Anthony is a highlight in the feminine department as Lucy. Too bad her part wasn’t bigger (but it’s big enough, I reckon).

The result is a tense and very well acted film.

It should have been a Masterpiece but...it was released in 2008 and America wanted pure escapism then, not tense spy thrillers that reflect the reality of two long endless wars...and it was released a little too close to The Good Shepard.

It was the Good Shepard with more action.

12117,"How free are you really? Are you a liberator or a controller?  

What is the main purpose of a movie? To entertain and amuse in one way or another, right? In other words, captivate your attention for the span of the movie's runtime. Great movies do this PLUS something else: They inspire you and make you think; maybe even enlighten. That's the power of the art of film. ""Instinct"" (1999) does this, which explains my high rating.

THE PLOT: Anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) goes missing in Africa for a couple of years; when he is found living with gorillas in the wild he kills a couple of rangers and injures others. After a year in prison in Africa, where he refuses to speak, he is extradited to a Florida prison and put in the mental ward. A young psychiatrist, Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), is assigned his case to see if he can get him to speak and learn what really happened in Africa. Meanwhile Powell's daughter (Maura Tierney) anticipates reconciling with her father; IF Theo can get through to him.

There are some peripheral characters (Donald Sutherland), but that's the gist of the story. Some people criticize the film as a mix of ""Gorillas in the Mist"" and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" with a little “The Silence of the Lambs” thrown in for good measure, but this only valid on a surface level. ""Instinct"" stands on its own; in fact, it's quite unique, which is a sign of greatness. The movie stands or falls on Hopkins and Cuba Jr. making their characters and their story come alive and seem real to the viewer. They succeeded for my wife and me. Within 20-30 minutes we found ourselves absorbed into the story and the characters; the film really picks up steam around the midpoint.

Some people, like Roger Ebert, criticize that the film tackles too many topics or messages, but I never got this impression, nor did my wife. There are the main themes: the limitations of freedom in conventional modern society and the abuse of controllers (or ""takers""); and there are a few subthemes, like the flaws of our prisons and mental institutions, as well as getting into the mind of someone else to understand their point of view (including non-humans). All of these are linked. The film never confused us or gave the impression that it cut off more than it could chew. If you appreciate films like ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) you'll probably value ""Instinct.""

Some criticize one aspect of the climax, but it happens. There are documented examples in the USA and all over the world. Also, keep in mind that Powell was imprisoned in the mental ward of the prison, not the maximum security area.

Is the story contrived to some degree? Of course it is; all movies are. Filmmakers have to tell a story and make their points within a limited timeframe, usually around two hours, and so there are always contrived elements, coincidences, etc. The trick is to pull it off without seeming too phony or forced, which is sometimes hard to do and it takes good actors. Thankfully, ""Instinct"" does a respectable job on this front, perhaps mainly because it has a few great actors, although some viewers may roll their eyes here or there. Regardless, it's in the area of ideas that ""Instinct"" towers above most movies.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Instinct"" is a psychological drama/thriller that entertains but also makes you reflect and ponder: How free are we REALLY in society? Are you a giver or a taker? A blesser or an abuser? A liberator or a controller? How can you be freer? How can you escape the manipulations and shackles of others, of society, of ""government""? How can you walk free of ""the game""? And so much more, like the ""doctor"" learning from the patient and the humility it takes to learn from someone who's ""under"" you.

Of course, it's old stuff, but it's curious how, even today, many people remember these films, which are still quite easy to find on TV in Portugal. In this third release, the quality and freshness of the comic material is still remarkable, and the film manages to keep up with the two predecessors with relative ease.

The plot continues to be the Achilles heel of these films, but it gives us what is essential to sustain an hour and a half of different antics, with some mixed action: with expenses rising, the city decided to extinguish one of the two training academies for existing police, one being our well-known academy, led by Commander Lassard, and the other a rival academy, meanwhile formed by Commander Mauser. Seeing things get complicated, Lassard turns to Mahoney, Jones, Hightower and other law enforcement officers already well known to all of us for help, knowing they are the right people for the mission.

Continuing the efforts of the previous films, the crew and cast members are virtually the same as in the previous film. Jerry Paris, who had directed the previous film, remains in charge of the production and manages to give a great sense of cohesion to all the work developed. The bulk of the cast is present again, giving us more than we've ever seen, without surprises, but managing to live up to our expectations very well. We have Steve Guttenberg in the role of Mahoney, but giving the character more maturity and a sense of responsibility. Michael Winslow gets more attention in this film, and better material to work with and showcase his vocal gifts. Bob Goldthwait also gets more attention and more refined material, and along with the hilarious Tim Kazurinsky, he's going to be one of the funniest course cadets at the academy (in fact, the two actors complement each other amazingly). Also Art Metrano manages very well and gives his character a touch of elegant cynicism, being the ideal target for the mischief of others. Leslie Easterbrook also has more room to show value, achieving in this film one of the most interesting works of her career. David Graf, Bubba Smith and Marion Ramsey keep the same record we're used to, no big surprises.

The film retains the production values ​​of its predecessors. In addition to good filming locations and good costumes, the special effects are of good quality and the action scenes here received a more attentive treatment, and they work very well, especially in the final part. The editing was well executed and the fast pace of the film doesn't tire us, although at times we feel that it is nothing more than a collection of situational and verbal jokes, one after the other, and not a comic feature film.",7.0

Alyson Hannigan plays the winsome daughter while Jon Lovitz is on hand as the researcher’s annoying brother.

“My Stepmother Is an Alien” (1988) is cut from the same cloth as the contemporaneous “Earth Girls are Easy.” Although it’s not as good and has a strange off-kilter vibe, it’s vastly superior to future duds ""2001: A Space Travesty"" and ""What Planet Are You From?"" (both from 2000). While I’m not a fan of Basinger (I don’t NOT like her either), she does comedy surprisingly well, better than you would expect. 

This was the feature film debut of future “stars” Alyson Hannigan and Juliette Lewis, as well as one of Seth Green’s early movies. The roles of the latter two are almost unnoticeable. Meanwhile, whoever wrote the script loves Jimmy Durante.

There’s a surprising scene involving porn that, while it doesn’t get outrageously out of hand (and I could care less about its inclusion), it seems out of place for a warm-hearted family flick.

Next thing, his father is found with a plastic bag over his head, things start exploding and the two are wanted by the FBI for murder, treason - just about every crime in the book.

Keanu is a handsome man, and in many, many of his roles that carries his somewhat limited acting abilities; well not here and Weisz doesn't really turn up either. That said, the production standards are decent, and there is plenty of action to keep the thing moving along but the formula is tired and I was pretty bored after the first fifteen minutes. The film managed to sustain that ennui quite successfully, too.",6.0
12129,"**_Madcap misadventures with Herbie in Latin America_**

Jim Douglas’ nephew (Stephen W. Burns) inherits Herbie, but has to pick the car up in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, with his mechanic friend (Charles Martin Smith) wherein they meet a mischievous little pickpocket that Herbie takes a liking to. John Vernon and Richard Jaeckel appear as dastardly villains while Harvey Korman plays a nutty cruise ship captain with Cloris Leachman & Elyssa Davalos on hand as passengers.     

""Herbie Goes Bananas"" (1980) is my favorite of the original four Herbie flicks. The amusing story is more compelling than the previous three and the star-studded cast is noteworthy with everyone giving it their all, especially Korman and Leachman. The cast were having a good time and it shows. A highlight is that this one shows Herbie talking, albeit cute car-language, not English. 

Meanwhile Elyssa Davalos is the most beautiful female to be featured in the Herbie franchise up to this point, plus there are several beauties in the periphery.

The next film would be the rebooted TV movie “The Love Bug” (1997), which is my favorite of the series, followed by the excellent “Herbie Fully Loaded” (2005). I favor the 1997 one because it’s the most compelling plus features the Dark Herbie and Alexandra Wentworth.

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot in Mexico (Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara & Tijuana), Panama (Panama Canal & Panama City) and the Los Angeles area (Ventura and Burbank).

Taking the slacker stereotype and turning it up to 11 there’s a good time to be had with this film. The chemistry between Ferrell and Reilly is excellent and in the scenes where they are let loose with the ad libs the film hits top gear. There’s some brilliant insults, a hilariously contrived situation, and in addition to the leads, the supporting cast are also all on point.

12146,"There's always the next something, Maggie. And that will take a man away.

The Missing is directed by Ron Howard and adapted by Ken Kaufman from the novel The Last Ride written by Thomas Eidson. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Cate Blanchet, Eric Schweig, Evan Rachel Wood, Jenna Boyd, Ray McKinnon, Val Kilmer & Aaron Eckhart. James Horner scores the music and Salvatore Totino is the cinematographer.

New Mexico 1885 and frontier doctor Maggie Gilkeson (Blanchet) has to seek help from her estranged father Samuel Jones/Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan (Lee Jones), when her eldest daughter is kidnapped by Pesh-Chidin/El Brujo (Schweig) an Apache Warlock who sells girls into prostitution.

An obvious variation on John Ford's The Searchers, The Missing slipped under the radar some what of Western fans who were greatly served by Kevin Costner's Open Range released the same year. It was a box office flop; which in a genre that has rarely hit great heights in modern times is hardly surprising, but to dismiss Howard's film as a fop is just wrong. True enough it's hardly original on the page, but it manages to not sacrifice character depth as it crams in the Western staples. While there is plenty enough here for none Western fans to enjoy; from the many colourful characters on show (including a great horror movie like villain in Schweig), to the panoramic scenery, and the number of action sequences that flit in and out of the narrative. There's a little something for most movie loving fans.

The cast, too, are value for money. Blanchet gives it guts and layers as Maggie, emotionally cold, is forced to put family dissension to one side and take up arms as a Western heroine, and Wood equally holds court with her transference from irksome waif to bold babe. Tommy Jones enjoys himself as he finds a cowboy role to suit his craggy features, features that impressively dovetail with Salvatore's stark photography of the landscapes. Along with the plucky and endearing young Jenna Boyd's performance it obviously only really mounts up to a broken family coming together under duress. But as a quartet, and with Schweig's vile turn as the ""monster"" of the piece in amongst them, they function so well, thus all character arcs are acted skilfully and please the senses. Also to be applauded is the use of genuine Apache language from some of the actors, a nice touch that shows a director taking his material seriously.

There's a few endings available to view via DVD etc, but the one that Howard chose for its general release is the right one. It perhaps doesn't hold any great surprise, given the directors reputation and output thus far, but it works well in the context of the story and the period tone set throughout. A safe film, then, one that is very well made and tells its story efficiently in structure and verse. If only the script had dared to take a few more risks then this surely wouldn't have been the monetary flop it was. Still, give it a go and you may find as much to like as I did. 7/10",8.0

I've heard this film a long ago, but I never interested to watch it. We can't avoid them, because when we look for a particular type of film for the occasion, they will pop-up and that is how I watched this now. I know it is a silly comedy, because in a real world this thing never happen. So knowing this is only for cinema, I prepared to enjoy whatever it offers. But I must say, even though my rating is not big, I kind of enjoyed it.

Nobody watches this without knowing its synopsis. So you will already know the fifty per cent of the story when you do. The rest is how it is developed; including how good the jokes are that comes with our watch. So much cliché, but entertaining with some good scenes and lines. The actors were excellent. The make-ups were not flawless, but worked okay, especially for a comedy. Because if there is an error, it will going to appeals from the comedic side.

So the overall film was better than what I presumed all these years. Glad I saw it, it's nothing like those silly comedies I've seen. I've seen many imposter themes, but this is refreshing. All the above, this is a one off film, that's the best thing about it. You know, sequels are what degrades the original film in most of the scenarios. Thanks for that, there's no follow-up for this with a B movie cast and crew. This is a very much watchable film, not comedy riot, but fairly does its job.

12153,"""White Chicks"" is a film that sparked mixed reactions due to its premise of black actors dressing up as white women, a concept that some found confusing and potentially controversial. Despite concerns about blackface and whiteface, the movie managed to navigate this sensitive territory at a time when such issues were not as heavily scrutinized, allowing it to avoid significant backlash.

The film's creative humor and unique concept contributed to its enduring popularity, with audiences still enjoying and quoting it years after its release. While the portrayal of black men disguised as white women may seem unrealistic due to the obvious nature of their disguises, the movie's over-the-top and comedic approach adds to its charm and entertainment value.

Ultimately, ""White Chicks"" is a lighthearted and cheesy comedy that aims to entertain rather than offend. Viewers are encouraged to approach the film with a sense of fun and appreciation for its playful and exaggerated take on gender and racial dynamics.

To add to their woes, another knock at their door reveals that a couple of hoodlums are after another sort of powdery mixture and are convinced that these three have it. What now ensues plays just a bit too much to stereotype for me. The baby does way too much irritating screaming - authentic, I know, but not after ten minutes in a cinema! I can't usually tell Danson and Selleck apart at the best of times and Guttenburg seems to add little to the rather far-fetched dynamic that is cluttered rather than augmented by the gangster thread, then a court hearing, then some antics on a construction site.

12155,"_TL:DR    
A modern sequel to a classic. Feels like it has a few narrative issues, but it wasn't enough for me to really dislike it. (It gets a 6/10 on the Dragon-Scale, because the Jabberwocky has an amazing design and it's walking looks so off-putting.)_

Alice... who hasn't heard of or watched it at some point? This is a sequel to the original, Alice is now 19 when she returns to Wonderland. Which... she has no obvious memories of, which, for an adventure with the scope she undertook when she was younger, I find a little hard to believe. 

She never acknowledges having any memories of Wonderland until the end of the movie. Which again, strikes me as odd, because even if she would write off her earlier adventure as a dream, you'd still acknowledge having seen it all before, right? Perhaps I'm just overthinking this, but even subconsciously you'd recognize some of the things you see... right?

In any case, Wonderland has gotten a lot darker and has gotten a healthy CGI coating. Which, might not seem super today, but I think it gives everything a very 'this is not reality' vibe. Which works in Underland's favor in my opinion, it's chaotic, lacking in conventional logic and absolutely infused with magic. And it's bizarre denizens all immediately pop out at you, with many strange shapes, weird behavioral tics and tend to defy the laws of physics.

The story is a coming of age story, which is immediately set up in the beginning as Alice is forced into a marriage with someone she barely knows. Something not uncommon for the time it is set in. And during the movie she figures out who she is, someone who'll do things her own way, prophecies and expectations be damned. Despite not being the easiest way, everything still falls into place eventually and the prophecy fulfills itself.

When she comes back to her reality, she turns down her chosen fiancé, gives everyone she's encountered at her engagement party some snappy one-liners, which, they all seem to take in stride. She then takes up her father's passion to establish brave new trade-routes all the way to China. Which, perhaps feels a little _too_ easy. (Considering everyone was calling her father insane for his plans, which she promptly takes a step further.) But then again, this is a story with talking rabbits, a hookah smoking caterpillar and playing card knights, so perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously.

However, it ends abruptly, and it is miscast. Cosner (and i am a fan) doesn't really make a good Earp. Dennis Quaid who I am also a fan of, doesn't make a good Doc. This was 1994, in the 80s I might have a different opinion, but they both looked a bit old for their characters and the time.

Twenty years past his glory days in the mid/late 80s, a wrestler (Mickey Rourke) struggles to make ends meet in New Jersey while wrestling on the weekends, taking illegal pain-meds, pursuing a dancer at the local strip club (Marisa Tomei) and trying to reestablish a relationship with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood).

This is an engrossing, but gloomy drama about the grim reality of celebrities from practically any field who are long past their prime; it just happens to be a wrestler in this case. People mock how fake wrestling is, but those talented guys bend over backwards to entertain the audience with incredibly painful stunts. The film was shot in the winter in New Jersey and this augments the bleak pall.

On the female front, Marisa is absolutely stunning as Cassidy (aka Pam) and Wood is convincing as the embittered daughter. Their relationships with the protagonist are a mixture of sweet, agonizing and moving.

The soundtrack features several quality songs from the 80s: ""Bang Your Head,"" ""Round and Round,"" ""Balls to the Wall,"" ""Animal Magnetism,"" ""Dangerous,"" ""Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone),"" ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" and more.

The movie reminded me of 80’s metal star Jon Mikl Thor and the excellent documentary “I Am Thor” (2015) and, to a lesser extent, “Anvil: The Story of Anvil” (2008). While neither of these is as melancholic as “The Wrestler,” and “I Am Thor” is sometimes laugh-out-loud amusing, they both effectively show the grey reality of former real-life celebs well past their halcyon days.

When we are in the ring, this is an action-packed and entertaining film that illustrates well just how brief these folks' moment's in the sun can be, at how fickle the audiences can be and at just how little a dilapidated body (and soul) can be left with when injury and age impose themselves. I was much less interested in the slightly contrived, and predictable, familial melodrama into which this sinks in the middle, though. I found myself really disinterested in his love life - with the unconvinced ""Cassidy"" (Marisa Tomei), or in his attempts to repair his torrid relationship with ""Stephanie"". Luckily, that is but an intermission before the grand denouement that sees him in the ultimate grudge match against his equally aged foe ""the Ayatollah"" (Ernest Miller). The script is lively and frequently quite witty, the direction of the fight scenes captures well the physical endurance required by these athletes, but it also shows us that their job is to entertain us - not to actually kill each other!

We've seen many movies with the same premise: man seeking revenge for his loved one/child.

This could've been an rare exception sticking out of the plot repetition, but it fails in other aspects.

The good bits:

* We get to actually care for the victims. They are more than just plot triggers, they are persons, and there is an emotional attachment.
* The protagonist isn't as over the top as in most revenge flicks. He's an realistic cop who, caused by tragedy, is losing his grip.
* In addition to the evil main antagonist, there is a deuteragonist; and I like this type of character very much: independent, but not good. Lots of potential in such a figure.
* The violence is naturalistic.

The bad bits:

* Whether as early as in script (several authors), or as late as in post-production cuts - this looks like important bits were simply omitted.
* The pacing is OK and follows the story, but at times, it feels a bit slow.
* some resolution is too clichéd.

This is an remake of an BBC series, which I haven't seen; my wild guess is: the original is much better.

I don't think this is a spoiler; just give you an idea of the calibre of plot-holes in this: Two criminals are arrested by half a dozen cops, with physical evidence to get them behind bars for years. The TV reports about this incident, so no way this gets hushed up. Yet, two scenes later, we see the same two bad guys strutting and driving around as if police would neither recognise nor bother them. Explanation? None.

Part of this is an unusual variation of the revenge-flick, with a tinge of supernatural; but another, large, part is a failed script or implementation.

A mysterious organization named SMERSH is killing off notable spies from top countries compelling James Bond to come out of retirement (David Niven). Peter Sellers plays a younger “James Bond” agent while Woody Allen is on hand as a diminutive “James Bond.” Orson Welles plays the lead heavy while William Holden and John Huston have small roles.  

“Casino Royale” (1967) is notorious in cinema and generally loathed by critics & cinephiles, but it’s actually superior to contemporaneous spy satires like “In Like Flint” (1967) and “Fathom” (1967). 

It was intentionally made with four different directors in mind for four separate segments, but ended up with six directors. There were originally 4 writers (if you include Ian Fleming’s book), but ended up with a total of 11. Welles and Sellers didn’t get along and refused to work together. It was one of the most expensive films of its day and cost more than any of the James Bond flicks up to that time.

Surprisingly, it all sort of comes together for a madly amusing 60’s secret agent farce despite the problematic Sellers being fired before all of his scenes were shot. I suggest using the subtitles so you can make out all the witty verbiage and follow what’s happening.  

The female cast is outstanding with Barbara Bouchet (Moneypenny) and Joanna Pettet (Mata Bond) leading the way, but also featuring Ursula Andress (Vesper Lynd), Jacqueline Bisset (Miss Goodthighs), Deborah Kerr (Lady Fiona) and several others, including Caroline Munro and Veronica Carlson in cameos.

It's not that these aren't entertaining enough, up to a point, it's that they are all just bit contrived to maximise the faux-menace whilst providing us with as many cameos as the five directors behind this over-long project can squeeze in - even Peter O'Toole must have had a bar bill to pay. Peter Sellers and original ""Bond"" girl Ursula Andress help to keep Niven and the ship afloat and for me, the ""Le Chifre"" (Orson Welles) scene at the gambling tables steals what there is to show. I think it does quite successfully parody the worst excess of the kitsch, the jingoistic and the kaleidoscopically coloured 1960s, rife with sexism and chauvinism and Niven seems to be very much in on the joke.

If “Highlander 2” was a complete disgrace and “Highlander 3” somehow tried to give us some compensation, this movie makes it look worse and more worn out. However, a TV series had been made that had little or nothing to do with the original film. What this movie came to try to do is to bring together the best of both worlds, but it failed completely.

The problems start at the bottom, that is, in the miserably written script and without ideas that can truly be considered good or intelligent. At no time did I feel that the story of this film was interesting or captivating enough to justify the effort of seeing it. From the development it makes, we must assume that the action takes place after what we saw in the original film, which doesn't make much sense if we remember that this film ends in the victory of Connor, the last and only Immortal. The film has lots of plot holes and moments where logic and coherence take a vacation and disappear. The dialogues are poor, poorly finished and annoying. Historical flashbacks don't always work.

The cast counts, for the last time, with the honorable participation of Christopher Lambert, now a mature actor. So mature it sounds dangerously old for the role he plays. Despite this, the actor does what he can with what little he has. Adrian Paul also doesn't let us down and gives a good performance, considering the filthy and regrettable quality of the material written for this film. Bruce Payne sounds histrionic and unconvincing, but he does what he has to do. The rest of the actors don't really have anything really good worth mentioning in detail.

Victim of a very low budget, the film appears for what it is: a very cheap and undercooked production, which tastes bad and looks even worse than it tastes. An excuse for an action movie with swords and frantic duels amid a series of abandoned or deserted industrial sites. The cinematography, sets and costumes are what we would expect to find, but the visual effects and CGI are poor, amateurish and really inexcusable in a 2000s full-length film. It's a disgraceful film.",1.0
12212,"Attempting to finish film school, a director doing her film about a serial killer killing his victims on urban legends starts to realize that a serial killer is running around behind the scenes killing off the crew, and must stop the madman before killing off everyone on the film.

This here was a pretty surprising entry. One of the things it does well is that it really features a lot of suspenseful work at times as this makes a hard time of determining if what's being seen is real or just being shot for the movie. It plays the movie-within-a-movie trick to nice effect, since it features enough to make hard to distinguish one from the other including it's wonderful opening sequence that takes a while before realizing after the fact it's been faked, a sequence where the assembled cast watch the dailies only for a strange cut-shot to play where one of the cast is viciously stalked and killed is screened where all but one thinking it to be shot for the film but the other positive that it's real and a later scene where a murder done during the recording of a scream-test loud enough to drown out the victim's own being great scenes. Even going away from that formula, there’s some rather fun stalking here from the bathroom chase featuring the woman trying to escape from the killer out into the alleyway or a thrilling chase through the recording studio and out into the surrounding countryside and pool while an attack at a carnival ride hidden by the darkness and fog comes off rather nice as well. The final confrontation in the movie-set graveyard setting is just fun, being creepy, exciting and all-around a blast with the true revelation and the different twists featured throughout make for a nice time here. The last big feature here is a really nice and healthy mix amongst the kills, which along with the mask worn are the film's rather good parts. This one here only has a few flaws to it. The main one here is that the main explanation for the killing has a lot of ways for how to interpret it, and it feels just too clumsy and unrealistic to be considered as believable. The fact that the violence is toned down from anything that it should have, since, for all the creativity displayed in the kills, it isn't very bloody and with a couple of kills that could've been in here. These are the same thing that really should've fixed by taking more of those and making them more bloody. It would've taken out a mild flaw in the film rather simply. The last flaw in here is the film's maddening ability to switch between the film shoot and the real world. It's fun at times, but there's also the fact that the film tries to be clever with changing around the two and it gets a little harder to defend the longer they go on. These here are the film's flaws.

12219,"**A needless and unnecessary remake, but that was very well done and does not disrespect the original.**

What usually happens when a remake of a film so acclaimed and so well remembered comes out that it's considered a classic? As a rule, we tend to think that the remake was totally unnecessary and that the original is always better. This film, in fact, is a remake that has everything to be considered unnecessary and, perhaps because of that, it was put a little aside by almost everyone. It wasn't a film that caught the attention, it went automatically to the television market without even going to the cinemas and disappeared quietly.

I have to admit that this remake was not necessary. The original film is incredible value and did not lack for such a thing. However, this production for television also has some value and some merits that we cannot fail to observe, otherwise we are not being fair. And the cast is, perhaps, one of the greatest merits of the film, which will keep the characters from the original, taking extreme care in reinterpreting some of them and including greater racial mixing. And we can say that all the actors hired are good, and they all do a truly exemplary job. Jack Lemmon and George Scott deserve all the attention, with colossal and powerful interpretations, but it is also worth seeing the work of James Gandolfini, Ossie Davis, Hume Cronyn or Dorian Harewood.

The movie also works pretty well considering it's a made-for-TV movie. I don't know if I can say that it has cinematic characteristics, but I wouldn't be shocked to see it in the movie theater. The cinematography is quite good, the sets and costumes meet what you expect to find, and the film is, in practice, a modernized copy of its old version. It was needless, it will never take the place of the original film, but it turned out to be a well done remake nonetheless.",7.0

A couple (Katharine Ross & Peter Masterson) moves from the Big Apple to Stepford, Connecticut, where many of the wives of the village are oblivious to the current women's lib movement; they seem wholly dedicated to their husbands, home & garden and keeping themselves well-groomed and primed for sex. The husband joins the mysterious all-male organization of the town which seems to be up to something fishy. Paula Prentiss is on hand as Joanna’s quirky new friend while Tina Louise plays another newbie resident.

“The Stepford Wives” (1975) is a drama/mystery that morphs into sci-fi/horror. It’s iconic for good reason. The story’s captivating and the movie’s all-around entertaining. The story's not campy at all, like the confused 2004 version. This is serious and creepy sci-fi/drama with a bit o’ satire. It powerfully succeeds while the similar-themed ""Westworld"" (1973) is only passable.

Unfortunately, the film takes too much time with the building mystery where some of the drama is just plain dull. Nevertheless, it’s a notable film of the 70s tarnished only by the misguided remake in the 2000s.

His solution - a night time job in a supermarket where he has an opportunity to ogle a variety of beautiful women. Then something miraculous happens. No - not a wet dream, he discovers that by cracking his fingers he can freeze time. All of the customers in his shop becomes statuesque.

Now there might be two schools of thought about this being either a darkly comedic look at art and artistry, or just a prurient exercise in excessive female (only) nudity. I'm not sure I cared though because I found this film to be glacially paced and just plain dull. The narration, provided by the nondescript Biggerstaff vacillated from the self-indulgent to the downright boring and the writing makes no effort to ingratiate this introspectively hormonal voyeur with anyone watching.

The animation is superb with just the right amount of music that doesn't overwhelm the storyline but does give us the memorable song of Cruella Deville. Speaking of the villain, Cruella is an iconic and fantastically over-the-top character, with Horace and Jasper adding to the trio's incredible dynamic.

The film is a delightful experience from start to finish, a complete classic that has been a box office success and is one of Walt Disney's triumphs.

Teddy Barnes is a conflicted lawyer, still reeling from the dubious methods of a colleague, she takes on the defence of Jack Forrester, who is accused of murdering his wife with a jagged edged knife. Gradually falling for Jack's seductive powers, Teddy falls in love with the man she now has to defend, her problems it seems, are about to become far far worse.

Jagged Edge, directed by Richard Marquand, starring Glenn Close (Teddy), Jeff Bridges (Jack), Robert Loggia (Sam Ransom) and Peter Coyote (Thomas Krasny), is bringing nothing new to the table of a much replicated genre. It does however boast brilliant acting, a tremendous screenplay (Joe Eszterhas) and a production value that demands it be viewed with less than cynical eyes. That it is written by Eszterhas is obvious when looking at the structure of the picture, death, sex, troubled romance, greed and that old devil called obsession (Basic Instinct anyone?), yet aided by a competent director and an exemplary cast, Jagged Edge shines brighter than most other films of its ilk.

It looks a little frayed (not jagged) around the edges now, but that is purely because of the advent of time and the ream of thrillers using this format that have followed this piece. If one (such as I) can transport oneself back to the 80s and view Jagged Edge on its original terms, then its easy to recognise just what a well put together picture it is. Close and Bridges are superb, whilst Robert Loggia steals the picture from under their noses, his interplay with Close is a particular highlight. In spite of some less than great twists and unsubtle scapegoat placings, Jagged Edge succeeds because you are there at the finale, and because its held you in its grip all along, you (hopefully) have invested yourself with these characters, you simply just have to know, for better or worse!

The ending was cause for much discussion back in the day, and viewing it now it still feels like a moment of cheek mixed in with some form of clarity, but rest assured it works well, as does, funnily enough, the whole film.

It's a more watered down story regarding Ming-Na Wen's character, with more focus put on lovey-dovey stuff as opposed to a fight of some kind.

12246,"_**The Origins of the Great Khan**_

As a boy, I had a bit of a fascination with Genghis Khan (meaning Great King) and even drew a picture of him titled, naturally, ""Temujin,"" his actual name. I don't know what it was that attracted me; likely his cool-sounding title and world-conquering exploits. With the exception of Iron Maiden's great instrumental, ""Genghis Khan,"" that ended my flirtation with this historical figure. That is, until I saw the Russian-made ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"" (2007) yesterday.

As the title suggests, the film explores Temujin's origins and what led to him becoming the great king of the Mongols and world-terrorizer. Despite being a foreign film with subtitles the movie successfully pulled me into its world and characters. The Mongols on the vast Asian steppes lived similar to American plains Indians. I've seen numerous photos of Mongols living on the steppes with their yurts, etc. over the years, but I could never relate to them as people. Just as, say, ""Dances With Wolves"" made American Natives come alive to the viewer so this film does with Mongols.

""Mongol"" eschews the American ""blockbuster"" syndrome and simply tells the story of Temujin from his early boyhood to his crowning as the great Khan. Although there's a steady amount of action throughout, there are a lot of quiet lulls with Temujin calmly waiting-out his various imprisonments and seeking Tengri, the god of the blue skies. Regardless, I found myself drawn into the characters and simple story.

I liked the fact that a monk was able to ""see"" Temujin's greatness and future world-conquering potential even though he was only a lowly slave, which others understandably couldn't see. I also liked the low-key commentary on people choosing their leaders and forsaking the less worthy, and the resulting strife, as well as the focus on Temujin's many quiet times in the wilderness seeking the Divine for wisdom and power to walk in his greatness and fulfill his dream, not that I'm suggesting Genghis Khan was God-ordained, of course. The lead actors are all great, especially Honglei Sun as Jamukha, Temujin's ""brother"" and then greatest enemy in Mongolia. Despite all this, people who require constant eye-rolling action and explosions will likely find ""Mongol"" boring.

Speaking of ""constant eye-rolling action,"" this was the very thing that ruined the 2011 version of ""Conan the Barbarian"" with Jason Momoa, who was excellent in the role. That film needed more downtime, realism and depth, similar to the original 1982 version (not that that version didn't have its share of cartoony-ness), the filmmakers instead pushed for overkill action with minimal dramatic weight. The result? A mediocre Conan flick that looked great but was ultimately too shallow and goofy, in the ""action-packed blockbuster"" sense.

Interestingly, ""Mongol"" reminded me of John Milius' version of ""Conan"" and of Robert E. Howard's Conan in general, albeit without the sorcery. I believe if the 2011 remake of ""Conan"" shot for the realism and seriousness of ""Mongol,"" as REH himself portrayed the character and the Hyborian Age, it would have been a more worthy Conan film. It goes without saying, if you like REH and Conan you'll probably appreciate ""Mongol.""

The soundtrack is simple but effective, often just an eerie-sounding violin/cello, reminiscent of parts of ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). I found it interesting that when the credits hit a great epic metal riff kicked in for a few bars before morphing into the expected Eastern-styled credits soundtrack. It was a pleasant surprise.

Had heard a bit about this movie before I saw it, many times refered to as being racist. In fact COMPLEX MAGAZINE listed it as number 4 on a 'most racist movies' list they made.

Watching it, I must say it's a whole lot less racist than I expected it to be. In fact I wouldn't call it racist at all.

It's about a white guy who gets into Harvard but can't afford to go there so he looks for scholarships that he can take but the only one applicable to him is one designed for African Americans. So  he fakes being black (with full blackface makeover and a 80's jerrycurl to match) and gets it.

There is of course a stigma around blackfaces stemming from early 20th century films where white people would dress up as black people and make fun of them and make them look stupid etc.

But to say that this movie is racist for that reason alone is very simpleminded. Cause even though the guy does put on a blackface, there is not a malicious intent behind it. And he does learn a thing or two about racism himself as the movie progresses.

I would probably argue that if anything it's more racist towards whites and perhaps a general white perception of blackness (at least of the time) than it is of blacks. But even that would be a bit of a stretch.

Anyways slightly overthinking it here perhaps, as it is in fact not a too serious movie but a comedy. And as a comedy, albeit it has a bit of a rough start it works pretty good.

The inclusion of big celebrities that kids won't recognize is a little odd, but the in your face 3-d stuff is irritating, and there were several forced scenes, and a conflicting message of competition vs cooperation.

12310,"Whilst it's not quite as good as last year's effort, Richard Lester has managed to reassemble the cast for another romp through Alexandre Dumas' stories of derring-do at the court of King Louis XIII (Jean-Pierre Cassel). Now following his near miss last time, Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston) has become even more fixated on exposing the Queen (Geraldine Chaplin) and her British lover Buckingham (Simon Ward) and so has commissioned ""Rochefort"" (Christopher Lee) and the menacing ""Lady De Winter"" (Faye Dunaway) to get the secrets from dressmaker ""Constance"" (Raquel Welch). Meantime, the loved-up ""D'Artagnan"" - the particularly scrawny Michael York - is also on her trail, aided by his three colleagues ""Porthos"" (Frank Finlay), ""Aramis"" (Richard Chamberlain) and ""Athos"" (Oliver Reed) and adventures ensue as they have to thwart the evil Cardinal's machinations and save poor ""Constance"" from the malevolent ""Milady"". It's colourful and action packed, with more from the others - especially the clearly in his element Reed who must have been swilling real vin rouge. Roy Kinnear rolls his eyes in disbelief with comic aplomb and we have quite a fun game of cricket that's far more explosive than any I've ever seen at Lords! Dunaway is great as the manipulatrix and Welch likewise as the naive young seamstress only just fitting into one of her own frocks. Heston features a little too sparingly to make much of an impact, but Christopher Lee delivers well too - his firing squad ""perhaps I'll die of old age"" did make me smile - as this enjoyable costume drama heads to it's rather fitting, but slightly disappointing, denouement. These are a good pair of films for fans of action comedies, and still bear watching fifty years later.",7.0
12311,"When you're back in England with the fleet again, you'll hear the hue and cry against me. From now on they'll spell mutiny with my name.

A tyrannical ships captain takes his reluctant crew on a two-year voyage that will change British maritime law forever...

Directed by Frank Lloyd and starring Charles Laughton, Clark Gable and Franchot Tone, this 1935 version of the often filmed tale of the ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (book by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall) is the template by which other adaptations would come to be judged.

We are in safe hands from the off due to the casting of Laughton as the strutting evil peacock that is Captain Bligh, and Gable as Fletcher Christian, the handsome hero who decides enough of tyranny and raises a sailor army to usurp the tyrannical Bligh. The pic positively thrives on the characterisations, instead of giving over to fanciful sea faring shenanigans, it's more concerned with the principal players and the conflicts that said characters partake in.

Based upon an actual real life instance, there's a realism factor on show as the sailors of The Bounty deal with the harsh realities of sea voyage in the 1700's, this before their captain thinks nothing of flogging an already dead shipmate!. We witness the best and worst of men at sea, this be a time where loyalty and harsh discipline were in turn expected and meted out as a course of nature.

It's a tragic tale, though it's a little let down in the mid-section when the ship gets to Tahiti and it's all jolification and frivolity, which belies the harsh nature of the core beast. Yet once Laughton and Gable square up against each other, we are in the presence of greatness, mortal enemies are born and they take us to a finale that asks us the audience if it is indeed justified? 9/10",8.0

I found Franchot Tone a rather good looking but wooden ""Byam"" and Gable's accent is probably best to be glossed over but the production standards, and excellent maritime photography are proof positive of what could be done without computer animation. There is a rousing score from Herbert Stothard and a great supporting cast of professionals - especially Ian Wolfe's efforts as the odious ship's clerk ""Maggs"" and Herbert Mundin's rather hapless ""Smith"" - giving this story added depth, a soupçon of humour and lots of style as they battle the hostilities of the sea and the inhumanities of a brute.

12335,"It's very much in the vein of ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) this, with a very similar style of live-action and animated sequences used to tell a slightly more menacing story. When three siblings arrive in a rural English village, evacuated from London during the Blitz of WWII, they are placed with the rather eccentric and definitely unwilling ""Miss Price"" (Angela Lansbury). Things start to look up for all concerned though when the kids discover that she is a trainee witch, and when they meet ""Emelius"" (David Tomlinson) they embark on some adventures using their magical bed as their vehicle in the search for the missing part of a substitutiary locomotion spell that might just thwart the Nazis. As with ""Poppins"", the music and lyrics come from the Sherman twins and ""Beautiful Briny"" and ""Portobello Road"" are probably the two best from their not so catchy soundtrack this time. Lansbury and Tomlinson work well together with the former on good form as the ostensibly prim and proper, but actually quite feisty and mischievous would-be witch. The three youngsters also perform well, especially the youngest ""Paul"" (Roy Snart) who just won't let anyone else near the knob that controls the bed! A smattering of familiar faces help to keep the story bobbing along nicely and the animations, tough not so frequent as I would have liked, blend in well with some fun action scenes - especially at the end - and make for an enjoyable, feel-good, family movie.",7.0
12395,"_**Val Kilmer and Sam Shepard investigate a murder on a South Dakota Reservation**_

A young, half-Sioux FBI agent (Val Kilmer) teams-up with a veteran agent (Sam Shepard) to investigate a murder on a Reservation in western South Dakota where the pro-government faction conflicts with ARM, the Aboriginal Rights Movement radicals. Graham Greene plays a tribal police officer.   

“Thunderheart” (1992) is a Western that takes place in the modern day loosely based on events relating to the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. ARM from this movie is an expy of AIM, the American Indian Movement, which is a traditionalist organization that was radically active in those days and still exists. Some understandably consider AIM a terrorist organization back then in light of actions such as Leonard Peltier’s murder of two FBI agents in 1975 at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which is referenced by Cooch in the movie (Shepard).  

You don’t have to be knowledgeable of any of this stuff or to take one side or the other to appreciate the movie. While it takes a side (which I’m not going to reveal), I’m in the middle and just here for the picture. I like the film, but it’s slightly hindered by wannabe hip banter. Moreover, the almost god-like powers of certain AmerIndians are laid on too thick, but I appreciated some of the spiritual elements.

The film runs 1 hours, 59 minutes, and was shot in South Dakota at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Wounded Knee Cemetery and Badlands National Park, as well as Washington DC.

12400,"Redbelt may not be, though it’s still pretty good, David Mamet’s best, but it is for the most part an interesting sample of his work in that it showcases some of his most finely honed traits and, more importantly, it is proof that the true mark of a gifted filmmaker is the ability to elevate any genre he chooses to use as raw material (his Spartan is another good example, as is Steven Soderbergh’s Haywire); in this case what we have is a deconstructed martial arts film, complete with a Big Tournament at the end – but the events leading up to it, and how the tournament itself unfolds, are handled with Mamet’s characteristic ear for realistic dialogue, attention to detail, and patience; the necessary patience to allow the plot to develop as a natural and organic succession of characters’ choices and their corresponding consequences, as opposed to, well, a plot. As a result we are spared such clichéd sights as the Training Montage, for instance, or the Romantic Interest.

The hero is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu teacher Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor), whose mantra is “There is no situation that you cannot turn to your advantage.” In keeping with this, Mamet weaves a script where there are no wasted movements; as in a Rube Goldberg machine, every disparate element – idealistic sensei, shallow Hollywood star, troubled police officer, traumatized female lawyer, long-suffering wife, crooked club owners, shady businessmen, etc., etc., etc. – is interconnected with the others and all serve the story just like all roads lead to Rome. Even something so apparently random as some dude performing sleight of hand in bar in exchange for drinks will eventually fall into place and fit in with rest as neatly as a key going into a lock.

Only the ending seems like it was taken straight out of a much inferior movie (think something like a Kickboxer or a Never Back Down), and represents somewhat of an anomaly among Mamet’s filmography which, mostly for better but sometimes for worse, is nothing if not consistent – consider 1988’s Things Change, whose deus ex machina not only had a better set-up but was much easier to swallow because the movie was, after all, a comedy. But here the fanciful climax feels tacked on, especially after the effort made by both the filmmaker and his expert cast to invest the story with a palpable sense of realism. To go out of his way like this, Mamet clearly cared a great deal about the main character – and so will most people who watch the movie, though not necessarily, at least in my case, at the expense of inner logic.",5.0
12403,"**_Great island locations but the story is essentially a..._**

Two newlyweds (Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich) set out to enjoy their honeymoon hiking the incredibly scenic Kaua'i, Hawaii. Unfortunately they catch word that a crazy murderous couple is on the loose and they become seriously suspicious of other hikers (Timothy Olyphant and Chris Hemsworth, amongst others). Will they escape their honeymoon alive?

""A Perfect Getaway"" (2009) is worthwhile if, like me, you enjoy island-adventure movies like ""Mysterious Island,"" ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Six Days Seven Nights."" The film was shot at Kaua'i, Puerto Rico and Jamaica (the sea cave sequence) and these locations are spectacular. 

Also, the character played by Timothy Olyphant and his woman (Kiele Sanchez) are likable and you can't help but start to root for them by the time the third act roles around. Olyphant is ""outstanding."" Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is also impressive as a grim/laconic badaxx hiker in a glorified cameo. Marley Shelton easily wins the Best Beauty award, but her role is too small and the filmmakers fail to take advantage of her presence.

Everyone knows by now that this is a 'twist' film and consequently the story takes a jarring turn in the final act. I'm not going to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it. I recommend seeing ""A Perfect Getaway"" if you like island flicks or films with surprising plot twists (or both). See if you can figure out the twist before it happens. I did and will explain below why it was easy. However, let me humbly add that I didn't have it figured out 100%; I just suspected the twist and that's how it turned out.

The film is good for what it is, but there are a couple of things that turned me off. One has to do with the twist, explained below. The other has to do with the film being a whodunit thriller. By it's very nature the story has to cast suspicion on several characters and, as such, they are often portrayed in a negative or weirdo light, which doesn't change until the last act when the real murderers are revealed. In short, there's just too much negative energy amongst the players, but this is somewhat offset by the impressive redemption of a couple of the characters in the third act.

The movie runs 1 hour, 38 minutes.

GRADE: B-

**_SPOILER ALERT_** (Don't read any further unless you've seen the film).

We discover in the third act that the main protagonists played by Zahn & Jovovich are the murderers and that they're actually impostors of a recently murdered newlywed couple. The reasons I was able to figure this out was because (1) I knew beforehand there was going to be a plot twist and so was looking for it and (2) in a murder-twist scenario it's usually the most innocent/vulnerable persons who are guilty (e.g. ""Howling V: The Rebirth"").

Twist films like this have now become so common that they're no longer even surprising. What would really be refreshing and 'cutting edge' is if the film simply played it straight, i.e. the people we think are the protagonists remain the protagonists throughout and the suspicious/evil people get their comeuppance (""Cape Fear"" is a good example).

My problem with the twist is that it makes the whole story a lie -- the very people we come to care about and root for in the first hour end up being despicable criminal scum of the lowest depth (at least Zahn's character anyway) and the suspicious characters that we're led to believe are the murderers wind up being the protagonists we should care about. To the film's credit we DO end up caring about Olyphant's character and his mate by the end of the story.

Yes, I realize that, in a way, the film isn't lying to the viewer once the characters played by Zahn and Jovovich are understood to be the murderers. When this is understood, most (maybe all) of their conversations are authentic as the impostors/killers but not as the innocent newlyweds, if you know what I mean. It's all a matter of perspective. But, still, this doesn't take away from the fact that the viewer has essentially been baited and switched -- the very people we think are the innocent/vulnerable protagonists end up being the guilty/malevolent scum bags. Consequently, the viewer can't help but feel hoodwinked at the climax.",6.0
12405,"Dev Patel is great here as ""Jamal"", a young man from the Mumbai slums who shot to fame by winning the first ever jackpot on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" only to be accused of cheating. It's not an unreasonable allegation - this lad comes from a background that suggests little, if any, education and yet he is answering some tough questions that, theoretically, he should not know the answers too. It's during this (actually quite brutal) interrogation, which is interspersed with flashback and with each round of the television quiz, that we discover a little of the childhood and upbringing of this young man and about how he has amassed the knowledge to, legitimately, get the answers correct. It's a story about humanity and decency, this - and the ensemble cast, especially the street urchins, help to deliver an authentic glimpse at not just the poverty in which they lived, but of their sense of community and loyalty to each other as they grew up together. Now there's no point in pretending that the writing is great - it isn't. It's doesn't really allow for any in-depth character development. Somehow, though, Patel's sheer screen presence and optimism, coupled with the overall style of the film cover up for that more than adequately leaving us with a solidly entertaining, occasionally thought-provoking, rags-to-riches story that I suspect many people can readily identify with. It's a bit too long, and maybe the romantic elements could have been ditched, but all told it's still well worth watching.",7.0
12405,"Slumdog Millionaire is one of those movies that really sticks with you. It follows Jamal, a kid from the slums of Mumbai. Watching him go through so much and still come out with hope makes it pretty powerful.

The movie does a great job showing the reality of life for kids in poverty but doesn’t feel like it’s trying to preach. Director Danny Boyle keeps things moving with a fast pace, and the mix of tension, humor, and drama keeps you hooked. The visuals are great too, showing all sides of Mumbai, from the city to the harshness of life in the slums.

Overall, Slumdog Millionaire is a must-watch. It’s raw, emotional, and, at the end of the day, it’s a story about resilience and hope. Perfect for when you want a movie that hits hard but leaves you feeling uplifted.",9.0
12437,"I should have crushed you under my heel the day you were born.

Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is the prequel to the previous two Underworld films. It tells the story about what led to the werewolf/vampire feud, with bloody energetic results.

In core essence this is Braveheart/Spartacus, only in CGI laden horror/action form. Michael Sheen buffs up into Karl Urban, who as Lucian (bad ass Lycan) leads his species to a bloody revolt, and Kate Beckinsale has made way narratively for Rhona Mitra, who sexes things up. The action is pulse raising and the Gothic designs and atmospherics are first rate, while the battle royale finale is fit to crown any genre film of its type. 

Problems are evident, though. The constant flow of CGI blood becomes irritating after a while, and Bill Nighy (in spite of being a franchise regular) is still looking miscast! But it has proved to be a series with hairy legs and fangs that refuses to die, a popcorn munchers dream.

The first movie left a lot of gaps in the story, where did Lucian come from, what started the war, how did he get to be the lover of the King's daughter in the first place.  While there is a lot of epic battles with the gore that goes with, this movie is easily the best movie in the franchise, which is minor heresy on my part since Kate Beckinsale is the quintessential vampire in my book.  Rhona Mitra throws down hard as the rebellious daughter of the King, and her haughtiness and disdain are completely believable to the point we think that Lucian's love for her is unrequited.  I can't go into it any more without spoiling the movie but if Evolution let you down a bit, Rise of the Lycans will restore you faith in the franchise.",10.0

It's no longer a cheesy, children's franchise - but a dark, gritty and thoughtful piece of work from David Yates that really does convey some of the sinister and malevolent aspects of JK Rowling's book. Harry, Ron and Hermione are all but grown up - whether they are old enough, or not - and with their friends and allies must now prepare for the final battle with ""Voldemort"". This involves the seeking out and destruction of the crucial horcruxes that each contain a part of the life-force of their evil foe. The writing is taut, as is the direction - the personalities of the three characters we have followed for the last 9 years have developed into plausible people - with quirks, strengths, weaknesses - and (sadly) even romantic tendencies. It's fantastic cinema, with captivating visual effects, characterisations and a much more mature storyline that deals with both triumph and disaster using a superb ensemble cast drawn from amongst the best actors who all contribute to build a real sense of unity and jeopardy ahead of part 2....

This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry.

Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.

As the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others  held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.

Is it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well?

Not just the three stars, but others we have seen for many of the series come into their own - Dame Maggie Smith (""Prof. McGonagall"") gets some wand action, as does Julie Walters with a cracking duel with Helena Bonham-Carter's ""Bellatrix Lestrange""; the magical effects are superb and the multiple threads all tie together well.

<em>'The Hunchback of Notre Dame II'</em> isn't necessarily anything terrible, I don't dislike it, but it kinda lets itself down with a tamer plot, poorer music/score and less interesting key characters.

The animation certainly takes a nosedive, with all the onscreen talent looking a little worse for wear. Tom Hulce remains solid as the main man, while Jennifer Love Hewitt is at least a big name to attach to the film; her role, Madellaine, is very underdeveloped. Michael McKean is, of course, notable too, but sadly his Sarousch is a very basic villain.

This film's plot is what lets it down, as they create an incredibly unimaginative story regarding a bell called La Fidèle. If that wasn't enough, the main plot point surrounding the bell is a total cop-out.

The movie seems bleak a lot of the time. The secret is to allow yourself to care about the characters and be patient. It reminds me of the very early Coronation Street shows: no glitz, no glamour, just like down in the muck with real people.

If you have seen this movie already, you know the plot, and if you don’t, stop reading reviews and just watch the darn thing. The more you know about it, the less impact it might have on you.

If you liked those two movies and Three’s Company, you’ll appreciate this, but it’s too meandering and arguably the least of the three. Ritter is his likable self though and the female cast is notable (Denise Crosby, Julianne Phillips, Chelsea Field, Diana Barton, Jean Marie McKee, etc.).

One sequence that I could do without is eye-rolling crude in a juvenile way, but the payoff line is pretty funny.

The movie runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles and Malibu with studio stuff done in Culver City.

It was the first time I saw the uncut version after watching the VHS countlessly in cut form. What a revelation it was - especially seeing it as a child.

12491,"The eponymous creature (Franco Citti) is a bit of a malevolent sponge. Hs has deserted his wife and child so he can sit with his mates carousing and playing cards whilst he pimps out ""Maddalena"" (Silvana Corsini) and lives off her ill-gotten gains. He's quite content with this arrangement until she has an altercation with a Vesper and then finds herself rather unjustly locked up for a year. With his income dried up, he has to make some changes. He's ill equipped to get himself a job, and isn't really motivated either. Until, that is, he meets the wandering ""Stella"" (Franca Pasut). There are certain similarities between her and his incarcerated meal ticket, but she's no hooker nor anywhere near as green as he'd initially thought. He gradually starts to fall for her but can he sort himself out and jettison the worst elements of his past before she tells him to take a run and jump? Though it's hardly a jolly affair, I found this first of his movies to be one of Pasolini's merrier affairs that allows some humour to pepper a narrative of exploitation and manipulation. There's little doubt that the ""Accattone"" is a pretty odious man, but as the film moves along there's a sense that begins to creep in that he's not beyond redemption - and both the intimate photography and the engaging talent of the boyish Citti help bring that out slowly but surely. Pasut and Corsini both play well with parts that are gritty, earthy and devoid of anything that might really offer them any hope, and on the sidelines his young son ""Iaio"" (Danilo Alleva) often serves as the most of unlikely of anchors for his selfish father. There's always space for a comment on the place of the church in society, and here there's a distinct parody being drawn between sainthood and, well you decide... Hardly ever seen these days but well worth a couple of hours to see a Rome that Nero might well have been proud of.",7.0
12493,"I didn't take to this initially. The scenario reminded me a little of an episode of ""Columbo"" - a rather sterile, studio-set environment that came across as quite limiting. Once it gets going, though, it's one of the best crime thrillers I've seen in ages. It all centres around the kidnapping of a small boy for whom the anger-prone, shoe millionaire ""Gondo"" (a strong contribution from Toshirô Mifune) is supposed to pay a ransom of ¥30 million - a colossal sum. It turns out, though, that it's not his son who has been snatched - it's the child of his chauffeur. Why ought he to pay? Will he just get on with his impending company takeover or will he risk bankruptcy for the young ""Shinichi""? This is a film split into three sections. The first deals with the decision making process around will he/won't he/why should he. Next, the police must try to apprehend this individual. This process is meticulously carried out and Kurosawa has chosen to immerse us in some of that detail, rather than just cursorily skip through it. This makes the whole detection process a much more interesting part of the film; allowing some aspects of the characterisation of the police officers to develop and also introducing some dark humour to the proceedings. Finally, we reach the denouement with it's own rather curious and not entirely explicable agenda. There's an element of ""what would you do?"", there's a grim depiction of a seamier side of Japanese (heroin-fuelled) culture that we seldom get to see and there is a rather starkly effective dose of humanity presented here as the story juggles aspects of human nature, nurture and good old fashioned greed in quite an effective fashion. It's based on an Ed McBain book (which I haven't read) but the entire project has been successfully subsumed into it's guest culture for a gripping and detailed mystery that flies by.",7.0

12498,"***When a murderer is the likable protagonist, mmm-hmm***

A simple, slow, seemingly pensive man (Billy Bob Thornton) is released from a mental hospital in central Arkansas after 30 years and gets a job fixing lawnmowers. He makes friends with a boy & his mother (Natalie Canerday) and they let him live in their garage, but the mother’s abusive boyfriend presents a problem (Dwight Yoakam). John Ritter is on hand as the mother’s gay best friend. 

""Sling Blade"" (1996) is a small town drama with a memorable central character (if I didn’t know beforehand that Thornton played the role, I wouldn’t have recognized him). The characters and their situations smack of real life while the unhurried story is interesting enough. There are well-done moments of meditation and revelation, as well as touching ones.

It’s a tad overlong, however, and the politically correct glorification of Vaughan (Ritter) is eye-rolling. Karl (Thornton) observes that “The Bible says two men ought not lay together. But I don't reckon the Good Lord would send anybody like you to Hades.” Yet his opining doesn’t mean much since he candidly acknowledges elsewhere that he doesn’t understand a lot of the Scriptures, not to mention his foolish predilection for murder to solve mundane problems. He should stick to fixing lawnmowers and eating them French fried potaters, mmm-hmm.

12498,"**A film full of challenges, to which Billy Bob Thornton, in his greatest work, responded categorically.**

I didn't really know what I was going to find when I decided to watch this film, and I'm happy about that: it's a really good, convincing and moving story, which doesn't try to escape the harsh reality of things to create unbelievable heroes. And it is probably the most solid and significant work of Billy Bob Thornton's career. In fact, he not only plays the main role, but is also responsible for the script and direction. It is a labor of love, of total and absolute commitment, which makes this film a ""Magnum Opus"", even though Thornton has done other works that are equally notable and full of talent.

In this story, we follow a seemingly kind and harmless man who has lived his entire life in a mental institution where he was imprisoned as a child, after killing his mother and her boyfriend. Now, he is a mature man, but he doesn't know anything about the outside world, he has no connections of any sort with anyone (he has a father, but there is no emotional bond between them) and he has a serious mental disability. However, doctors consider him well enough to return to a normal life. When he leaves, he returns to his homeland, where he meets a boy who is roughly the same age as he was when he was institutionalized. The friendship between the two leads him to meet his mother, a young woman who has a complicated relationship with a man with a violent nature. And despite her limitations, he quickly realizes that this man could be dangerous to his new friends.

The whole story revolves around values that are very dear to us: friendship, kindness and altruism. It's not a completely unpredictable film, but it works very well and presents a deeply credible story. After all, you only need to open a newspaper to see dozens of situations of domestic violence and dating abuse that end badly. It is a subject that deserves deep social reflection: in a world where possessive relationships are increasingly observed, it is essential to understand that love only makes sense if it is based on trust, understanding and mutual acceptance. The film also challenges us to rethink our prejudices about mentally disabled people: they have feelings and emotional needs, just like us. After all, being mentally ill does not mean that you are a psychopath or sociopath.

Technically, the film presents us with excellent cinematography, in addition to a wise choice of filming locations and a careful design of the costumes and sets in Rural America. If the film is not very clear as to the geographical location where the action takes place, filming took place mostly in Arkansas, and it seems appropriate to place the fictional story somewhere between this state and its neighbor, Missouri. The well-modeled rhythm does not cause drowsiness or wear out the audience.

As I already said, it is Billy Bob Thornton who deserves the most praise for his work in the general work, and particularly as an actor. Playing dramatic roles as mentally disabled people is always challenging: there is a permanent risk of transforming the character into a caricature worthy of condemnation and offensive to people. Thornton manages to be authentic, credible in his interpretation, and reaps the fruits of this magnificent work. In addition to him, Dwight Yoakam also deserves an applause for a challenging and difficult job, in which he did wonderfully well.",9.0
12500,"The Bottom Line

A basic action movie from the '80s but it doesn't hold up.

Plot

An American soldier with special skills gets posted to an island base where someone keeps hijacking military convoys. When his convoy gets hit, he's cooperating right up until someone hits the Colonel's daughter, and then he intervenes. His memory of his childhood is mostly gone from an explosion on an island, but he has obviously had training. When the hijackers send Ninjas after him, it becomes obvious though that his skills are way more than just simple techniques.

What I Liked

Some of the basic fight scenes are fine, particularly between Joe and the Black Star Ninja. And the opening sequence is really well done. There's a scene where they shoot arrows at him, and he uses the handle on a shovel to deflect their trajectory...highly iconic and when I first saw it as a kid, I was hooked.

What I Didn't Like

I rewatched it recently, and it just doesn't hold up. As I said, some of the basic fight scenes are good, but the fight scenes with guns seems more like a Stephen J. Cannell TV show where a million bullets are fired but nothing ever hits its target. In addition, some of the stunt work is either done at low speed, shows that it isn't the actor doing the stunt (particularly a motorcycle jump), or in one case, requires a helicopter to hover in place for about 5 seconds for the stunt man to get ready to jump on the front.",6.0

12501,"I'm not going to go on living in the middle of a civil war.

Retired sea Captain James McKay (Gregory Peck) arrives in the sprawling land of the West to marry fiancée Patricia Terrill (Carroll Baker). With an amiable, almost pacifistic approach to life, McKay confounds the ranchers he is now mixing with. Particularly the Terrill ranch foreman Steve Leech (Charlton Heston) who takes an immediate dislike to him. Not only that but it seems that James has landed right in the middle of a family rivalry between the Terrill's and the Hannassey's: just as it's about to fully ignite into war. 

Directed by William Wyler (Ben-Hur/Mrs. Miniver), The Big Country is adapted from a short story called Ambush at Blanco Canyon that was written by Donald Hamilton. Beautifully photographed by Franz Planer on location at the Red Rock Canyon in Mojave, California and at the three-thousand acre Drais ranch in Stockton, the film is epic in many ways. Though the story, with its twin themes of violence begets violence and you don't have to act tough to be tough, is a thin one, it's given such an operatic make over by Wyler that it's not hard to be swept away by it all. Helped enormously by the afore mentioned Planer, music composer Jerome Moross, and an impressive and on form cast (Heston in superb tough guy mode and Burl Ives delivering a Oscar winning performance as head Hannassey patriarch Rufus), it's a big production in many ways. 

Overall, The Big Country sees a small story made big as it's told in an astutely classic style. With memorable acting, gorgeous scenery, big music and notable moments of action (a fist fight between Peck & Heston alone is epic and apparently took three days to get right) it's a must see for the Western enthusiast. 8/10",8.0

Add to the mix, quite a bit of rivalry from Charlton Heston (""Leech"") who is the Major's right hand man, and a man who has designs on ""Pat"" and finally Jean Simmons who own the ""Old Muddy"" - the river that both are essentially fighting over and we've got a great recipe for a top class action adventure. It has the greatest of cinematography, a score that you instantly recognise and performances - especially, I felt, from Ives that really do resonate - they engender a sense of just how tough, dangerous, uncompromising and beautiful life for these pioneers must have been. Also how civilised it could be with men of honour and principle prepared to stand their ground - however misplaced that might have been.

12505,"""Little Nikita"" is a highly addictive film and it makes for compelling viewing from beginning to end. Richard Benjamin appears to have forsaken his own acting career in favour of pursuing directing instead and he has certainly selected a very wise choice of material this time around. Benjamin's career as an actor has often reflected that of someone like Clint Eastwood in a lot of ways. They only specialised in playing a particular type of character for the most part and this undoubtedly restricted their choices principally because they may not have coincided with audience expectations concerning what they might have wanted to see them appearing in, but they have now successfully managed to extend their range into other genres as a director and apparently with great acclaim.

12509,"_**Downer biography starts weak, but becomes, um, artistic… and moving**_ 

Abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock (Ed Harris) is a struggling artist in New York City in the early 40s when he meets his future wife Lee Krasner, a fellow artist (Marcia Gay Harden). They move to the far end of Long Island where he finally catches a break, but alcoholism threatens his life. Jennifer Connelly shows up in the last act. 

“Pollock” (2000) is an honest biography covering the final fifteen years of the artist’s life from 1941-1956. It was a long-term passion for director/star Ed Harris to bring to the screen. 

The film starts weak with Pollock being portrayed as a troubled artistic weirdo. While I have no doubt that this is true-to-life, the opening act fails to capture the attention of the viewer. What’s worse, there’s an unintentionally amusing scene reminiscent of the Seinfeld episode ""The Visa"" where Jerry pretends to be morose and disturbed, which unexpectedly turns on George’s Asian girlfriend. This “meh” opening is probably why the film failed at the box office.   

Thankfully, the story perks up when the couple moves to a remote area on Long Island. At one point a journalist asks Pollock how he knows when he’s finished with a painting. He insightfully responds, “How do you know when you're finished making love?” This showed that Jackson loved his work and equated creating art to making love. He was a troubled soul, very much so, but painting was his escape, his bliss. It was Pollock’s area of genius and, indeed, his peculiar art is stunning and somehow aesthetically pleasing. I was so moved I wept.

Unfortunately, alcohol was his downfall.

If you don’t mind downer biographies of artists, like “The Doors” (1991) and “Big Sur” (2013), check this one out. There are inspiring moments amidst the melancholy.

He declines the throne allowing the elder son of his predecessor ""Saturninus"" (Alan Cummings) to accede instead. The new Caesar quickly declares his intention to marry Titus' daughter Lavinia (Laura Fraser) - a match nobody is keen on. She tries to flee, but her father prevents this escape, killing one of his own young sons in the process - but the damage is done. The emperor marries ""Tamora"" (Jessica Lange) - a hostage Queen of the Goths brought back from the war and what now ensures is Shakespeare at his most brutal - just about every crime in the book is featured - a battle for survival in which no-one is safe. The style of this production mixes the traditional (Oscar nominated) costume based drama with a more modern interpretation of other aspects of the complex story. The screenplay does try to stick to the play in general (though the men in the pie bit is perhaps an addition!) and the quirky nature of the characterisations are well captured by the likes of Cummings - a sort of Charlie Chaplin meets Hitler persona; Harry Lennix stands out as ""Aaron"" - a man who really epitomises evil and there is fun to be had from ""Demetrius"" (Matthew Rhys) and ""Chiron"" (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) whose leather clad antics are worth seeing before pie-dom looms. The direction from acclaimed theatre director Julie Taymor offers us quite an unique perspective on this lesser known but powerful tale of lust, greed and power and that perspective enhances some of the more physically (limiting) theatrical aspects of this play - especially when filmed out of doors. Sir Anthony is on authoritative form and Jessica Lange's malevolently sexy performance is probably the best depiction of that character I have seen on stage or screen.

12525,"Lots of horror franchises eventually reach the stage where they just kind of go ""You know what? Fuck it. You're going to space."" That direction is a little more natural in _Critters_ than with other series, seeing as the titular badguys are themselves from space. But it's still a little odd to jump forwards in time like they did. Seems like the sort of thing that would kill forward momentum in the series. Which I guess it did, seeing as it took another 27 years for another _Critters_ to come out after this one, when we had the first four come out in a six year stretch. I guess it was more important to have humans in space to save money on this film than make another one.

It's just boring and makes no sense. The characters are dull and two-dimensional. Drastic character changes from previous installments make no sense. Even the Crites don't feel that threatening, despite the first death being a bit more gruesome than any of the previous ones in the entire series.

Actually, I think that's part of the problem with this series' trajectory. In the first movie, the Crites are the main bad guy and the main problem to deal with. After that, it almost feels like they're there to set things off, but they aren't the main problem the characters have to deal with any more. There are other frequently more pressing problems and threats that have to be dealt with, and it seriously has taken away from their screen presence.

The original wave of the ""Critters"" film series saw 4 films crammed into 6 years, with the decline in quality of each one reaching its nadir with this part 4. Gone is the funny asides that once blended seamlessly with the bloody antics of the razor teeth furballs, in place is a dull ""Alien"" clone that renders the Critters as bit part players in the series baring their name. In fact the makers have completely jettisoned one of their best forms of attack - the ability to fire lethal spikes from their personage.

Still, the cast remains a curious point of interest, what with two Oscar nominated actors working for food. The simple spaceship interior design is effective for the ""stalk the prey"" story axis, and the cinematography is pleasing for genre tropes.

12526,"Possession has been a lifelong preoccupation for William Friedkin. He’s addressed it head-on as both fiction and fact, but Bug sees him take a more oblique route. Here’s the story of a man so thoroughly possessed by paranoia that his delusions are contagious. One demon leaves one body to enter another, but an obsession is Legion.

Every Michael Shannon performance is arguably his best, but this is a film tailor-made for his fascinating idiosyncrasies. Aphid and spastic, his body language stops short of actually turning into a freaking insect.

Ashley Judd, however, has a more challenging role, because not only does she have to sell the transition from sane to crazy, but then she has to catch up with Shannon, go toe-to-toe with him, match his manic intensity — and I’ll be damned if she doesn’t; Judd digs deep and reaches a place of utter darkness and desperation. She stares right into the abyss and doesn’t flinch.

Everybody is in point, though; Friedkin and screenwriter Tracy Letts, pull off the rare double-turn (to use wrestling terminology). Harry Connick Jr., who plays Judd’s character’s abusive ex, is all brawn and no brains, while Shannon starts out helpless and meek (his patented, infallible calm-before-the-storm routine); we begin to dread the seemingly inevitable moment when Connick beats Shannon within an inch of his life, only to end up wishing that the former would slap some sense into the latter.

The only problem with this film is that it builds so much momentum it just can’t help crashing and burning. It’s so climactic that it actually becomes anticlimactic. There’s no resolution, no catharsis. For all its shock and awe, The Exorcist allows itself a hopeful, optimistic coda; Bug lacks such an escape valve. This time, the Devil wins.",6.0
12537,"Usually if there are two separate timelines featured in a story, the director tries to ensure that we cannot readily distinguish between one that might be true and one that might be artificial. It's the complete opposite that really works well here as we mingle the story of an 18th century woman living within the constraints of high Victorian society with a more profligate 1970s one. To fit out the earlier scenario, we meet the shy ""Sarah"" (Meryl Streep) who is rebounding from a liaison with the titular French lieutenant by having an even less suitable assignation with the altogether more decent ""Charles"" (Jeremy Irons). The modern day scenario has the same two actors playing ""Anna"" and ""Mike"", only both are married to others and they are the ""real"" life actors portraying these other characters in a film of their lives. Now we get to experience the story of both relationships undulating in parallel. It sounds way more complex than it actually is as a combination of Harold Pinter's adaptation of the original novel and the acting from both Streep and Irons manages to convince us that though we are seeing two separate stories play out before us, they have remarkable similarities in the life imitating art sort of space. I preferred the older scenario, but only because the supporting cast of characters could make much more of their rigid, sexist and downright hypocritical environment and Streep works well with her frankly quite insipid ""Sarah"". The more modern day story tended more to soap for my liking: their behaviour more duplicitous, selfish and that led to a disappointing degree of predicability. More relatable, if you like. I'm not really a fan of Irons, but here he works well across both iterations and gels remarkably well with a Streep who seems to morph from both of her persona effortlessly and convincingly. The pace can dawdle at times, and maybe Karel Reisz could have just tightened things up a little at the rather plodding start, but the production design across both storylines looks good and it's once the tram lines are laid down and the two become entrenched, it becomes quite a compelling story of love, lust, betrayal and lies.",7.0

Neeley certainly has that established look to him, but I actually found him rather underwhelming (it doesn't help that his are certainly not the best numbers). As the story gathers momentum the other two very much come into their own leading an ensemble cast that mixes historical and contemporary styles of music and dance, language and imagery to try to modernise (1970s style) this provocative story. Josh Mostel turns in quite a fun routine as the slightly camp King Herod, and Barry Dennen likewise as the conflicted governor Pilate but for me the whole thing really belongs to Anderson's traitor. The settings serve it well, Douglas Slocombe knows well how to use the ancient monuments and some modern lighting to deliver that extra layer to differentiate it from the stage performance - which, at times, this all too closely resembles. Groundbreaking it certainly was, but time hasn't been especially kind to it and fifty years on it almost comes across as much of a parody as ""Life of Brian"" (1979).

Perhaps he has grown up, and he does really care? I didn't really know, nor care myself. The characters are womanising, drunken, louts - good looking, I suppose - but their arrogance towards those less fortunate is irritating; their attitudes towards women - an approach I find common in Fellini films - almost prehistoric.

Sinbad gives the most noteworthy performance of the cast, in his role as Simms. Even so, it isn't anything great or memorable from him. All of the others aren't worth mentioning, though it is cool to see Rafiki himself, Robert Guillaume, make an appearance - I didn't actually know what he looked like before watching, but in one of his early scenes he laughs and I knew instantly it was that man.

The plot is what lets this down. Just a quick glance at the cover gives off negative vibes, while the opening few scenes don't give you any more confidence either. It's extremely predictable, as well as being rather messy - you don't see the villain until the final 20-25 minutes, so are waiting for around 70mins for the obvious to come to fruition.

It has been so long that until I recently read a description of it on this website, I couldn’t have told you any of the characters’ names, though I could have reeled off several of the actors: Meg Tilly, William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum, Jobeth Williams, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, Glenn Close - all of whom we have enjoyed in other roles as well. 

The plot isn’t deep, though it touches upon the serious topic of suicide, but it is humorous and fun, and one of those flicks where we find ourselves repeating lines from it , such as, when we are grocery shopping and say maybe we shouldn’t get something fattening: “We have to think of the others,” and throw the item into the shopping cart. It is that kind of movie. Now that I have written this, we shall have to watch it yet again.",10.0
12560,"**_The growing ennui of college grads from the 60s in the early 80s_**

Seven former college friends from Michigan meet near the coast in small town South Carolina after the death of one of their old gang. They spend the weekend together reminiscing on their youthful ideals, where they are now, and where they’re going.

Written & directed by Lawrence Kasdan, “The Big Chill” (1983) has the same plot as “The Return of the Secaucus Seven” from three years earlier. The difference is that it has a blockbuster budget and bigger-name actors, but not necessarily the better story.

Speaking of the cast, the characters include the couple who own the big old house in South Carolina (Kevin Kline & Glenn Close), a TV star in the mold of Magnum P.I. (Tom Berenger), an attorney (Mary Kay Place), a journalist for People magazine (Jeff Goldblum), a discontented mother/housewife (JoBeth Williams) and a Vietnam vet who’s obsessed with drugs (William Hurt). Meg Tilly is also on hand as the girlfriend of the deceased.

While this was a hit when released, some amusingly refer to it as “The Big Dull.” Obviously, you have to be in the mood for a drama. I think Kasdan & the cast did a good job of making it seem like these are indeed old friends from college catching up after almost two decades. I also like the movie’s droll sense of humor and, of course, the 60’s soundtrack, not to mention the great Southern location.

Unfortunately, the awkward insemination subplot is eye-rolling and almost singlehandedly ruins the story. But this is made up for by Chloe's moving choice, which is unexpected. The former college 'radicals' are more or less intellectual whereas Chloe is visceral and mystical.

The film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes, and was shot primarily in Beaufort, South Carolina, which happens to be the nearest town to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island.

From such things the mighty Destoroyah is born - the toughest enemy Godzilla has ever faced...

It's not only the last of the ""Heisei"" era of Godzilla, it's also one of the best in the whole franchise. It was meant to be the swansong for the big atomic lizard, which would have been fitting as it happens, but when Centropolis took up the rights and produced the must chastised 1998 blockbusting Matthew Broderick pic, things changed...

G-Force is on the case here trying to find out what the hell is going on (armed with the new awesome Super-X III), which brings in the human facor coupled with some wonderful sci-fi babble. Godzuki is in here, but he's not the cute goggle eyed cuddly thing we have seen before, he looks like the big parent only in smaller form - and here having junior in the piece works.

The effects work isn't the best of the series, and some of Destoroyah's abilities are strangely not explained - which is annoying. Fans of all things ""Zilla"" will rejoice at the nods and homages to the past ""Zilla"" entries, which is credit to Toho Studio for showing respect to their baby (and the fans).

With their behaviour becoming more erratic and tensions mounting, well who knows what's going to happen next. This might be my favourite Depardieu performance as he really does thrown himself into the role body and soul, and with Ardant delivering an equally impassioned characterisation we are presented with a lively, tempestuous and at times quite visceral series of scenes as things spiral out of control. I'm not always a fan of narration but here, the sparing use of commentary from local tennis club boss ""Madame Jouve"" (Véronique Silver) helps fill in the gaps but also lets off some of the steam - physically and metaphorically, as the story becomes more involved.

Dignified, eloquent, perhaps even incredibly sad, The Shootist mirrors John Wayne's personal situation and closes his career (and life) with a poignant last hurrah. Based around the popular novel from Glendon Swarthout (Where The Boys Are), and directed by the astutely knowing Don Siegel (The Duel at Silver Creek), The Shootist begins with edited scenes from Books' (Wayne's) life, where he literally ages before us during this montage. Cut to his arrival in Carson City in 1901 and we are about to be witness to the end of an era. Wayne is backed up in his swansong by Lauren Bacall (Bond Rogers), James Stewart (Doc Hostelter) and an engagingly important Ron Howard (Gillom Rogers). While a big shout out has to go to Bruce Surtees' cinematography which perfectly captures the elegiac nature of it all.

I never have been big on Westerns, but after viewing The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, I thought he was okay.  Now having just seen The Shootist, I apologize for everything I've said against him before.  He was truly brilliant in this, his final movie, and it was a fitting ending for a memorable career that spanned three decades.  Forget everyone else; his performance makes the movie!

Once his doctor, James Stewart, has confirmed the worst, he manipulates some of the local ne'er-do-wells into ensuring he gets the send off he desires. His relationship with Bacall thaws, somewhat, and we end with a gentle nod to both of their different sorts of humanity. Make no mistake, this isn't at all soporific, and Wayne and veteran sparring partner Richard Boone have the odd scene to remind us of both of their younger days (Boone only survived Wayne by 2 years).

An expedition from Guam investigates a remote island in the Pacific after a man dies of a fatal spider bite. Chris Potter plays the leader of the mission and Alex Reid the pilot.

“Arachnid” (2001) is an island adventure/horror that basically mixes the setting of “Six Days Seven Nights” (1998) and the later “Welcome to the Jungle” (2013) with horror elements reminiscent of “The Fly” (1986), albeit not limited to the one-dimensional warehouse milieu of that flick. The CGI effects in the opening are too cartoony, but the practical effects throughout the rest of the movie are well done considering this isn’t a blockbuster (surprisingly, it only cost $570,000).

While this is superior to the half-baked ""In the Spider's Web"" (2007), it’s not as good as “Arachnophobia” (1990). But I like the social dynamics of the castaways and the challenges of a hot jungle locale are palpable.  

Alex Reid is pretty good on the female front (I like her facial expressions). Spaniard Neus Asensi is also on hand as the attractive spitfire Susana.

“Pushing Tin” is a quirky drama with a healthy sense of humor and potent adult-oriented themes revolving around love, sex and loyalty. The high stress nature of the occupation is emphasized while amusing the viewer in an offbeat way and driving home some insights on the broken human condition and glorious potential.

Meanwhile Angelina Jolie plays Russell’s much-younger wife, Mary, who has alcohol issues; she was 23 playing a 21 year-old.

It's very much in the style of an Hammer film, with colourful scenery and cheap and cheerful visual effects. The stage bound style of the performances and the pace of the story hold it back a lot: it takes way too long to get going and the characterisations are really all about providing foils to Lee, who takes charge of the plot (and the screen) all too sparingly.

In the 1700s, a count in Bavaria (Christopher Lee) is drawn-and-quartered for murdering twelve virgins in his castle. Thirty-five years later, a nobleman seeking insights on his past (Lex Barker) is invited to the infamous citadel and, on the way, meets up with a striking baroness with a curiously similar goal (Karin Dor).

“The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism” (1967), aka “Blood Demon,” was called “The Snakepit and the Pendulum” in German (translated). It’s a mixture of Corman’s Poe-inspired flicks from the early 60s, like “The Pit and the Pendulum” and “The Terror.” While those two flicks are superior (especially the first one), this movie fills the bill if you’re in the mood for haunting Gothic horror with mysterious castles, beautiful maidens, Medieval villages, horse-drawn carriages, secret passageways, cobwebs, snakes, rats, torture chambers, zombies and sorcery in the mold of AIP or Hammer films.

The story isn’t very compelling in the middle, but you can’t beat the spooky mood of mid-60’s cinema and Dor is lovely. You might remember her from the contemporaneous 007 film “You Only Live Twice.”

After the great success of ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" in 1995 the producers didn't waste time in offering a sequel the very next year that's even better. Both films poke fun at the Brady's wholesome and unified spirit, but also highlight their early-70's outlandishness by having the stories take place in the mid-90s. Yet these movies are never meanspirited; there’s a welcome warmheartedness.

The cast & guest stars are great, including the villain played by Tim Matheson. Christine Taylor stands out as Marcia, although it's impossible to ever outdo the awesome Maureen McCormick. Jennifer Elise Cox also stands out as Jan, as does Gary Cole as Mike Brady. Shelley Long is effective as Carol Brady burdened by that absurd hairdo.

I'm giving this a fairly high grade because it's funny and entertaining from beginning to end. The funniest subplot is the sudden infatuation between Greg and Marcia (after it dawns on them that they're not REALLY brother and sister) while one of the best sequences is the public pool scene, embellished by black versions of Jan, Marcia & Cindy.

12615,"The age of social media would be a double-edged sword for Willy Loman (Dustin Hoffman) and his prophetic obsession with what we now know as 'likes.' One of his mantras is “Be liked and you will never want.” Today this would mean getting likes, and not just by the hundreds; if possible, by the thousands.

“One day I will have my own business and I will never have to leave the house,” says Willy. “Like Uncle Charley [Charles Durning]?” asks his youngest son Hap (Stephen Lang). “Bigger than Uncle Charley. Charley is not liked. He's liked but he's not well liked.”

Ironically, Charley is much more successful than Willy — as is Charley’s son Bernard (David S. Chandler) compared to Hap and his older brother Biff (John Malkovich) — despite, or perhaps because of his indifference to whether or not he is liked (“Why must everybody like you? Who liked JP Morgan? Was he impressive? In a Turkish bath he looked like a butcher. With his pockets on he was very well-liked.”).

Willy drew inspiration from Dave Singleman; “Old Dave would go up to his room, put on his green velvet slippers, pick up the phone and call the buyers. Without ever leaving his room at the age of 84, he made his living. When I saw that, I realised that selling was the greatest career a man could want because what could be more satisfying than to be able to go at the age of 84 into 20 or 30 different cities and pick up a phone and be remembered and loved and helped by many different people?” 

This could be thought of as the old fashioned way of sending friend requests, and if one wants those requests to turn into contacts — because, after all, “It's not what you do; it's who you know” — it's better to have, so to speak , a good profile picture; this is the sort of lesson that Willy instills in Biff and Hap since they were in high school (“I thank Almighty God you're both built like Adonises. The man who makes an appearance in the business world, the man who creates personal interest, is the man who gets ahead”).

In Willy's world, a man's life's worth is judged by the number of people who attend his funeral; for example, “When [old Dave] died, hundreds of sellers and buyers were at his funeral. Things were sad on many trains for months after that."" 

As for his own funeral, Willy dreams of a “massive” one: “Oh, they'll come from Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire. All the old-timers with the strange licence plates. [Biff] will be thunderstruck ... because he never realised I am known. Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, I am known!” 

All of this is as illusory as a Facebook profile, as are the 'memories' that Willy 'shares' with us, which represent an idealized view not only of the past but also, thanks to Willy's incipient senility, of the present.

The greatest irony of this film, directed by Volker Schlöndorff and adapted from the play of the same name by Arthur Miller, is Willy's inability to see that if people don't like him, it's not because he’s ""very foolish to look at"", but due to the simple fact that he’s just not a likeable person: he yells at his wife Linda (Kate Reid), whom he used to two-time on his business trips — when Biff catches him red-handed with another woman and loses his considerable respect and admiration for him, Willy accuses him of throwing his life away to spite Willy, who had placed high hopes on Biff's athletic prowess (Biff, however, never tells his mother what he saw, at the cost of having her resent him for his coldness towards his father) —; he constantly hurls insults at Charley, and even questions his manhood, (""A man who can't handle tools isn't a man""), but has no problem taking Charley's money (but not a job that would most likely be a sinecure when Charley offers him one after Willy has been fired); etc.

The “woman in peril” thriller has always proved popular since the advent of film, Midnight Lace may not have the class or menace of something like Gaslight or the best of Hitchcock, but it’s a splendid mystery thriller yarn. Pic sets its goals out from the start, as the delightful Miss Day is pursued through the pea souper fog by person unseen. Then the phone calls start, a weird voice at the end of the line issuing less than complimentary advice, but nobody is sure if she is really suffering these harassments.

So, enter a whole ream of suspects from weasels and schemers to the unbalanced and the too suave to be true, red-herrings now rule the roost and it’s great fun. As things progress Kit’s hysteria goes up a notch at a time until it’s all out psychological bedlam. The big reveal is not exactly a surprise, but the enjoyment was in getting there. Unfortunately the production loses points for some sloppy editing and poor design for the London setting, the latter rendering the already fanciful story a fake feel that’s hard to shake off, the theatrical origins evident for sure. Which is a shame because Metty's photography is sublime, the principal colours positively spanking (check out those greens).

I recently saw the two films that, most notably, precede this film: “Seven Samurai” and “Magnificent Seven”. The same story, in its essence, set in different places and different times, and made by drastically different hands: a Japanese film set in a troubled period of feudal Japan, and the classic American “western” that adapts this story for the palate. west, and which spread internationally. The American film, which I have just mentioned, then had a sequel which, in addition to being redundant and unnecessary, did not have a single point of merit in its favor. It was a mistake. This film, not being a mistake, can only be seen as a joke for the way it insists on repeating the story, the formula and the concept without having a single guiding element that unites it with its predecessors.

I won't dwell on considerations about the film's script: suffice it to say that there is a kind of military revolution in preparation in Mexico, the rural populations are, in a way, under the crossfire of the rebels and the loyalists, and they are going to ask for help from seven brave cowboys from the North American West to protect themselves from the brutal abuses they suffer in this context. It is, at base, the same thing we've seen time and time again. Was there really laziness to think among screenwriters at this point?

The cast of this film, however, has absolutely nothing to do with the previous films mentioned above. There is not a single face that has participated in them, despite the fact that, supposedly, the main character is the same Chris that Yul Brynner played, in such a competent and professional way. And they didn't even bother looking for another similar actor, or explaining anything to the public. Anything! After all, there are a lot of men named Chris! It could be this one, or that one. The audience inside the theater has already paid for the ticket, if we give them some good shootouts and a brave dose of action they won't want to know the details! That's how the production of this film must have thought... that the beautiful crap we have here came out.

I do not mean, however, to say that there are not some merits here. Unlike the film that came before, we have some capable actors who are trying to at least do something decent: conscious of responsibility, George Kennedy was a decent protagonist, and was well supported by Joe Baker, James Whitmore and Bernie Casey, but basically That's all we have. They haven't even bothered to compose a new song, or new songs that can match the old and overhauled musical theme of “Magnificent Seven”.",2.0

She effortlessly plays a multitude or roles as she tries to juggle her personal and professional feelings for these two men who offer us characterisations that we can laugh at and loathe in almost equal measure. I worked in live television for a great many years, and always admired the skills of those who can talk, listen, look and react all at the same time - the scene with poor old ""Altman"" losing half his bodyweight whilst on air still makes me squirm even now.

This is an alarming turn of events when the image of the news anchor supersedes the importance of global events simply because they are capable of bringing in substantial viewing audiences for a particular channel and furthering their own careers by doing so and established journalistic ethics be damned instead of their top priority always being the persistent pursuit of the truth.",10.0
12639,"**After “The Magnificent Seven”, we have ""The Magnificent Sloth"".**

Despite the aura it gained, Kurosawa's “Seven Samurai” pales a lot when compared to the grandeur of the film “Magnificent Seven”. However, and following the success achieved, the studios decided to make more films and sequels. I'm going to see them all, but I can tell you right now that this one isn't even half as good as the first film.

Let's start with the redeeming qualities, so we don't lose the will to write: Yul Brynner is an excellent actor, he is absolutely comfortable with the material given to him, and he has a profile for the film. Incidentally, he is the only actor from the first film who returned to play his character a second time – even imposing, as a condition, the dismissal of Steve McQueen, with whom he had had difficult disagreements behind the scenes of the original production. We still have good action scenes and shootings. The performances of Claude Akins, Robert Fuller and Warren Oates are also not far behind, with a great effort from the actors.

Everything else, however, is disappointing, starting with the script: it's exactly the same as the one used in the first film, with the same story and the same structure. The village that the Seven are going to help is exactly the same one they saved before, so the sets and costumes seem to have been reused. The soundtrack is exactly the same as the first film... that is, this film copied the first one, but with less great and notable actors. Frankly unfortunate… if the studios were that lazy to invest and make a decent film, they might as well not have done anything.",1.0

A month after the events of “Psycho II” (1983), a grief-stricken former nun (Diana Scarwid), a wannabe rock star (Jeff Fahey), a meddling reporter (Roberta Maxwell) and a bunch of football fans converge on the Bates Motel and the crazy world of Norman Bates (Anthony Hopkins).

Like the previous installment, “Psycho III” (1986) is a quality continuation of the iconic 1960 film, but more of a retread, which is why some call it a spiritual remake. I like it a little better than the prior sequel because it omits the contrived and confusing twists & turns of the second half. (But, if you seriously reflect on “Psycho II,” everything makes sense after the climatic reveal; you just have to put the pieces of the puzzle together).

Besides Scarwid, the film scores pretty well in the female department with comely redhead Juliette Cummins from “Friday the 13th Part V” (1985) and brunette Katt Shea. The film effectively contrasts lust and love. In addition, Fahey makes for an entertaining character and I like the addition of the celebratory football fanatics. There’s some atmospheric cinematography as well, directed by Perkins. 

What’s great about the Psycho franchise is that it has its own story and Norman is a sympathetic character. It’s really a tragedy and not like the formulaic slasher where the killer is a zombie-like machine and all its victims are mostly partying teenagers.

""Powder"" was the first of two films that came out in 1995-1996 dealing with a gifted individual who is super-smart and has paranormal powers; the second was ""Phenomenon"" with John Travolta. ""Powder"" is the superior. While ""Phenomenon"" is good, ""Powder"" reaches for greatness and, in some ways, achieves it, even while it’s marred by a few dubious moments.

Sean Patrick Flanery plays a hairless albino teen in East Texas, nicknamed Powder, who's discovered living in a basement after his grandfather's sudden death. As a ward of the state, he is placed in a boy's school where his uniqueness stirs up trouble.

For a film like this to work you have to buy into the character, and this is one of the movie's strengths. Flanery reveals his acting expertise in his convincing portrayal of the shy, gifted teen. Flannery's Powder stands strong with the greatest misfits in cinema, like Nimoy's Spock and Hank's Forrest Gump.

Actually, the acting is good across the board: Lance Henriksen as the hardened-but-open sheriff, Mary Steenburgen as a psychologist who grows to really care for Powder in a motherly way, Jeff Goldblum as a fervent science teacher who's astonished, Bradford Tatum as Powder's main enemy at school, Brandon Smith as a redneck deputy who instinctively hates him, but actually fears him, and the beautiful redhead Missy Crider, Powder's fellow student and potential love interest.

Roger Ebert dissed the film for a number of reasons, one being Powder's enemy's don't learn from him. On the contrary, one enemy makes a 180 after being enlightened, but ultimately reverts back to his former base mentality. This happens all the time in real life. On another occasion Powder does something miraculous and you can clearly see the change on his enemy's face, the realization & acceptance. Whether this will prove to be a lasting change or temporary, isn’t revealed.

Ebert also complained that Powder's electrical tricks upstage his emotional insights. Really? I think it's the reverse. While the electrical tricks are there to maintain the attention of those with ADHD, it's the film's potent insights that stay with the viewer. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the electrical tricks, but they're way too overdone to be realistic. At the same time, I understand why the writer/director (Victor Salva) included them: this is a MOVIE, not real life; it's meant to transfer ideas AND entertain, and it does both pretty effectively.

Ebert also griped that the ending is unsatisfying the more you think about it. Actually, the ending makes a powerful statement and is reminiscent of the spectacular translations of Elijah and Enoch in the Bible. Let's just say Powder was too good, too spiritual, for the simpleminded and mundane.

I'm not saying the film doesn't have flaws or eye-rolling moments, but they can be overlooked in view of the big picture and the film's successes.

As for the paranormal phenomena featured in the story, like psychokinesis, telepathy, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls ""the word of knowledge,” although some of these are exaggerated in the film I have a secret:

They're real.

12690,"We can't have our law officers beatin' people half to death for no reason.

Appaloosa is based on the 2005 novel of the same name written by Robert B. Parker. It's directed by Ed Harris, who also co-writes the story with Robert Knott. Harris also stars alongside Viggo Mortensen, Renée Zellweger, Jeremy Irons & Lance Henriksen. Music is by Jeff Beal and Dean Semler provides cinematography on location in Albuquerque, Austin and Santa Fe.

Appaloosa is in the grip of bully boy rancher Randall Bragg (Irons), who finally oversteps the mark when the latest Marshall and his deputies are killed in cold blood. The townsfolk decide enough is enough and hire no nonsense travelling lawmen Virgil Cole (Harris) and his sidekick Everett Hitch (Mortensen) to protect and serve the town. Ruling with a rod of iron, Cole & Hitch start to bring order to Appaloosa, but the arrival in town of pretty Allie French (Zellweger) causes quite a stir between the two men. Bad timing too since the guys are trying to get Bragg to his rightful execution.

In the modern era the Western has been the hardest genre for film makers to tackle. You can probably count on one hand the number of great or agreeable ones that have surfaced post Costner and Eastwood's efforts of 1990 and 1992 respectively. Enter Ed Harris, who undaunted by the long odds of getting a Western to be successful; and suffering worrying overtures from his backers at New Line Cinema, got Appaloosa made. Well made as it happens.

Since the story itself is etched like the Wyatt Earp legend, there's really no fresh perspective on offer here. In fact, anyone familiar with Edward Dmytryk's excellent Warlock from 1959 will feel some narrative déjà vu. But Appaloosa does have strong performances and lush landscapes to see it successfully home. Slotting in a good helping of action, romance and humour also goes some way to making Harris' movie a worthy modern day Oater. True, the cliche's are many, but Harris wasn't after revisionism, he wanted (and got) old fashioned Oater values. A film that follows those old beloved B movie Western conventions, but one that still retains a topical criminal thread.

The best reward in the film comes from spending time with Harris & Mortensen. Their characters are nicely drawn and not over cooked by the script. Cole & Hitch are devoted to each other, lots of straight love and respect exists between the two men. Their bond is believably brought to life by Harris & Mortensen, who formed a friendship when making A History Of Violence for David Cronenberg in 2005. Zellweger and Irons too are not without high merit value. She (stepping in when Diane Lane walked over delays), is pleasing and captivates in what is the critical glue role. While he is dandy dastardly supreme, a well spoken villain of much intelligence and crafty as a cat.

Appaloosa is a subtle film, both in story and as a technical production. Beal's score is unobtrusive, while Semler's photography manages to deliver that old fashioned feel that Harris was after (the low lighting for the interiors is particularly on the money) . Harris' direction is smooth and unhurried in pace, with the odd inspired bit thrown in for good measure (check out the up-tilt camera work during a train on a bridge sequence). While the production design can't be faulted. All that and you got the likes of Henriksen and Timothy Spall in the support cast too. A lovely film that is as tight as the friendship at its core. 7.5/10",8.0
12701,"**_Al Pacino transported to the American Revolution_**

After the Declaration of Independence, a fur trapper (Pacino) & his son are inadvertently enlisted in the Continental Army in the summer of 1776, wherein they find themselves fighting The Battle of Long Island. They end up working as scouts and are at Valley Forge during the cold winter of 1777-1778, as well as Yorktown in 1781. Nastassja Kinski plays a woman from an aristocratic family who joins the patriots while Donald Sutherland is on hand as an officer in the British Army.

""Revolution"" (1985) was made by the acclaimed director of “Chariots of Fire” and “Greystoke,” but the film flopped at the box office and was nominated for four Razzies. Is it THAT bad? No. It does a good job of taking the viewer into the midst of the Revolutionary War as a foot soldier or worker with the use of handheld cameras. The situation isn’t fun; it’s chaotic, life-threatening, dirty, grisly and full of hardships. The Continentals are a ragtag group of Americans suffering privations while the Redcoats are a disciplined, well-supplied army with degenerate officers. Speaking of which, the Brits aren’t painted in a positive light.

While the film isn’t as effective as “The Patriot,” especially in regard to character development, it makes for a worthwhile companion piece since it involves the northern theater of the war and the other the Carolina theater. On the downside, the English and Norwegian locations are sometimes a questionable substitution for New York, Pennsylvania and coastal Virginia, especially the mountains of Norway (standing in for northern New York and the Saint Lawarence River region, I think), but at least they’re picturesque and the sequences don’t last long.

The scene where Daisy leaves the fort at Valley Forge and is attacked by a British detachment on horseback is awkwardly executed but, hey, it’s a movie, not a documentary. I was inspired to look-up the real history.

The movie runs 2 hour, 6 minutes, but there’s a Director’s Cut from 2009 that’s 10 minutes shorter and features narration by Pacino. It was largely filmed in southern England, as follows: The old dock area of King's Lynn, Norfolk, as well as near Thetford, Norfolk, and Melton Constable Hall. The main battle sequences were shot at Burrator Reservoir on Dartmoor in Devon and on the coastal cliff top near Challaborough Bay, South Devon, which is where the wooden fort was built. The scenic scenes where Dobb is with the Huron were shot in Norway.

The Crites were supposedly exterminated at the end of the ""Critters 2,"" yet these monsters come from nowhere with no explanation.

The tone of the movie is wholly inconsistent, as well. It actually starts off almost like it's supposed to be a kids movie (it sets the kids up as the protagonists). Then, of course, people get attacked and eaten. Not that many, much like the first movie, but still. It keeps jumping back and forth between cutesy and bloody. Again, who was this made for?

The acting is mostly phoned in, too, with some of the actors hamming it up while other seem to put in a genuine effort with the poor script they've been given. If you want to see a very young future Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio doing a B-grade sci-fi horror movie, you've come to the right place. In fact, that's probably the only reason to see this movie unless you absolutely, positively have to see every ""Critters"" movie.

12707,"Not great like “Jaws,” but a moving maritime tragedy and, in ways, magnificent 

RELEASED IN 1977 and directed by Michael Anderson, ""Orca"" stars Richard Harris as a Newfoundland fisherman trying to make some big money by capturing a killer whale for a marine park. Unfortunately he ends up horribly botching the job, which incurs the vengeful wrath of the father killer whale.

Coming out two years after the blockbuster “Jaws,” this is sort of a knockoff, but it’s too different in story/tone to be cheap imitation, although there are obvious similarities: The last third of the film involves a boat crew sailing out to sea to take on the oceanic antagonist; and another scene where an individual slides down a leaning platform toward the marine creature. In any case, “Orca” may not be technically as good as ""Jaws"" but it certainly has its unique attractions.

The story is a maritime tragedy and utterly serious in tone with no lightness to be seen, like in “Piranha” (1978). The melodramatic plot basically inverts Melville’s “Moby Dick” wherein in the whale takes the place of bitter Ahab. The score by Ennio Morricone (e.g. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"") is equal-parts beautiful, touching and haunting. Also, the casting is great: Harris is perfect as the aging sea salt, Charlotte Rampling is super sharp & intellectual as the cetacean biologist, Will Sampson (""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"") is great (and clichéd) as the Indian sage with his wise, foreboding words and Bo Derek is, well, you know.

In addition, the Newfoundland locations are fabulous and, at about an hour and a half, the film is short and sweet; so there's not much filler. That said, people suffering ADHD might complain that the pace is a little slow at times.

A couple of notable scenes come to mind: The unsettling sequence where Orca's mate aborts her calf while strung up on the vessel; and the one where Orca causes mass destruction in the village at night whereupon Nolan (Harris) gazes at the havoc while the whale jumps in and out of the water in elation.

Let me close by emphasizing that “Orca” is NOT a Grade B creature-on-the-loose flick (e.g. 2000’s ""Crocodile""); it's a serious and moving tragedy.

One of the many treasure seeking action adventure films that surfaced after Raiders of the Lost Ark reignited the flames in 81, Firewalker has a somewhat iffy reputation. Yet it's a glorious cheese sandwich of a movie, a ball of laughs and high energy jinks, a pic where Chuck Norris, Louis Gosset Jr. and Melody Anderson are having fun and not taking it as seriously as some film punters have.

Standard rules apply here, two adventure seeking guys, very buddy buddy and playing off of each other with sarcasm and respect in equal measure, hook up with a sexy gal who has a treasure map - oh and she has a gift involving visions type of thing. Cue lots of scrapes, arguing, bit of romance, more peril, over the top bad guy (Sonny Landham) and a friend in need (an over the top John Rhys- Davies).

In this one we get to see some of Norris' martial arts skills, especially during an action packed bar-room brawl, while the intentional comedy hits the required part of the funny bone (a swimming sequence and the use of religious disguises are particularly fun packed).

Several college students in SoCal break into a condemned convent for kicks, but its infamous past turns out to be worse than they understood. Havoc ensues.

""The Convent"" (2000) is an over-the-top horror/comedy that’s creative, energetic and edgy, but it’s too wannabe ‘hip’ and overcompensates. It’s no where near as bad as “Killer Tongue” (1996) in this regard, but it’s cut from the same cloth. Though only costing $1 million, the special effects are quite good and hold up. Some people don’t like the fast-motion effects for the creatures, but they worked for me.

I get that this is a stylishly cheesy horror flick with a black sense of humor (and a plot ripped-off from “Night of the Demons”), but the story has to hold up for viewers to accept what’s going on to some reasonable degree. Unfortunately, there’s the glaring plot hole of the school staff suddenly showing up one day looking like veritable monsters and the students just go along with it. Hands get beaten to a bloody mess with a yard stick, the ‘nuns’ write ""hail Satan"" on the board and spew green vomit on students, but _none_ of them informs their parents or the police of what’s going on or, at least, get the Gehenna outta there? _Why Sure!_

Winsome Joanna Canton is good as protagonist Clorissa and Megahn Perry is effective as the cool Goth girl with a droll sense of humor while Chaton (Itae) Anderson is worth a mention as Sapphira, one of the ‘devil’s disciples.’ Adrienne Barbeau shows up in the last act for a hammy performance. She was 54 during shooting and her body was still in perfect shape.

At the end of the day, this is entertaining to a point with its acknowledged highlights (and more, like Coolio’s amusing cop), but the ‘hip’ frat boys are too annoying and the overall vibe is that of trying too hard to be a cult flick. It was shot in 1999 and I couldn’t help think that this was the tipping point for the decline of America and Western Civilization.

The relationship has long since been strained as the concert pianist mother had to make plenty of sacrifices - and choices - that affected her family. When she unexpectedly visits her daughter, the two sit at a piano, an experience that unlocks the flood gates on an history of blame, recrimination and resentment - though not without some considerable affection, too - and we are taken on a fairly joyless guided tour of their lives together. To add to this already fairly emotionally turbulent cocktail, ""Charlotte"" discovers that her other daughter ""Helena"" (a wonderfully authentic effort from Lena Nyman) - who suffers from a pretty severe mental illness - is also being cared for by her sister, and yet more demons emerge. Essentially a double-hander between the mother and daughter, this story runs the gamut of feelings and though at times you can't help feeling that the scenarios are just a little unnecessarily downbeat, the tightness of the close up photography and poignancy of the dialogue makes for a compelling evaluation of human ambition, priorities and, of love.

Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster head the cast as two polar opposite American adventurers who get involved with Maximilian's royal house and Juarez's revolutionaries in 1860s Mexico. Cooper plays Benjamin Trane, basically a good man, tho one tainted by much cynicism, and Lancaster plays Joe Erin, gunman and an untrustworthy crook. Vera Cruz was the first release in SuperScope (beautifully shot by Ernest Laszlo on location in Mexico) and with director Robert Aldrich at the helm, the film brilliantly captures the violence and danger that was brought about during Mexico's revolutionary period. Adapted by Roland Kibbee and James R. Webb from a Borden Chase story, Vera Cruz very much feels like (is) a precursor to Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. 

With its blend of comedy and outright action, the film is essentially a buddy buddy Western with a cynical amoral kicker. It's a blend that may not be to everyone's tastes, but with Lancaster (grinning for all he is worth) and Cooper (laconic supreme) in the leads the film rises above its oddity status. The professionalism on show, both from the obvious big stature of its stars and Aldrich's astute choreography of the action sequences, ensures this is a polished piece. There's much machismo of course, one only has to see that Charles Bronson, Ernest Borgnine and Jack Elam are in the support gallery of thugs to know this fact, but it should be noted that the picture is interested in showing a fair reflection of the Mexican conflict. The Mexican government of the time were outraged at the film, but on reflection now it's evident the film doesn't take sides. That to my mind has to be applauded. 

Some problems exist, notably some of the dialogue is a touch too corn based now. While as the main female character, Denise Darcel is out of her depth. One could think that she is maybe swamped by all the testosterone around her, but when you notice that Sara Montiel is coping fine in a secondary role, it shows Darcel to be limited. Vera Cruz held its own on release, neither busting the box office nor sinking without a trace. It would take over ten years before the true value of the film would start to be noticed. With that, it now shows to be very influential within the genre. Explosive, important and darn good fun, that's a mixture you just can't ignore. 8/10",9.0
12766,"_**Dynamic Mexico-oriented Western with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster**_

After the Civil War, two soldiers-of-fortune (Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster) meet in the heart of Mexico and end up taking a job for Maximilian I, Emperor of Mexico, to escort a lady aristocrat (Denise Darcel) from Mexico City to Vera Cruz on the coast. Although they have help from imperial troops, they are assaulted by Juarez’s rebels because there’s gold to be had. 

“Vera Cruz” (1954) is an overlooked powerhouse Western that was made back-to-back by Cooper with “Garden of Evil.” I think they’re both really good Westerns, but give the edge to this one. It has comic book qualities that I don’t like (e.g. the trivial conflicts and superhuman marksmanship), but is otherwise an austere, action-packed, life-or-death adventure with spectacular Mexican locations, featuring the magnificent Pyramid of the Sun, not to mention two beautiful women (Denise Darcel and Sara Montiel). 

This is one of Lancaster’s top roles as he plays the lusty anti(non)hero with his charismatic grit-teethed grin counterbalanced by Gary Cooper’s aged, brooding antihero. One of these two is redeemable while the other isn’t. It’s kind of obvious, but the climax reveals all.

The peripheral cast includes notables like Cesar Romero, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson and Jack Elam.  

The movie is short-and-sweet at 1 hour, 34 minutes, and was shot in areas east of Mexico City, including the Pyramid of the Sun.

12766,"In the aftermath of the US Civil War, two mercenaries find themselves working together in an uneasy alliance. ""Trane"" (Gary Cooper) is the more refined of the two, ""Joe"" (Burt Lancaster) little better than a thug, but both are good with a gun and that attracts them to the ""Marquis"" (Cesar Romero) who suggests to them that there's money to be made serving the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (George Macready). To his palace they go and after some sharp shooting proves their worth, they agree to escort the ""Countess"" (Denise Darcey) to the port of Vera Cruz. She certainly needs an escort for the local population, under the leadership of ""Gen. Ramirez"" (Morris Ankrum), is bent on removing this Napoleonic interloper from his throne and establishing a republic. It's only when they cross a river that the men notice the countess must weight rather a lot more than her frocks suggest, and that starts them thinking of another, more lucrative, agenda for their journey. Thing is, she has plans of her own and is quite prepared to use her wiles on either or both of these characters to get her way. As they near the garrison, treachery is rife and things come to an head - but it's by no means clear who will emerge ahead of he game. There's a great chemistry here between Cooper and Lancaster, with the latter on great form as the likeable man you couldn't ever trust. The support is also effective, especially from the usually nondescript Romero, an almost as untrustworthy ""Donnegan"" (Ernest Borgnine), Jack Elam and Henry Brandon's menacing ""Capt. Danette"". It packs loads of sultry duplicity, betrayal and good old fashioned greed into a busy ninety minutes and though I was, as usual, on the wrong side at the denouement, it works well enough as an indictment of venality tinged with romance.",7.0
12767,"_**Manor-in-the-woods thriller/horror**_

A troubled New York City couple (Dennis Quaid & Sharon Stone) move to the country after purchasing a dilapidated estate at a can’t-refuse price. Unfortunately, the manor’s past interrupts their enjoyment of their new home. The cast is rounded out by Stephen Dorff, Juliette Lewis, Dana Eskelson, Christopher Plummer and Kristen Stewart (who was 12 years-old during shooting).

“Cold Creek Manor” (2003) is a drama/thriller with a bit o’ horror that mixes “What Lies Beneath” (2000) and “The Messengers” (2007) with “Undertow” (2004). Instead of cabin-in-the-woods, it’s a manor-in-the-woods flick, but don’t expect over-the-top slasher antics (e.g. silent masked killer with a machete), as this one’s more low-key and realistic, albeit saddled with eye-rolling thriller/horror clichés.

If you can roll with that flaw and a laughably executed snake sequence, this is pretty much on par with “What Lies Beneath” and “The Messengers” although it lacks the artistry of “Undertow.” Stephen Dorff is outstanding and the movie brings to life the small town/rural area with the residents thereof. People criticize the casting of gruff Dennis Quaid as a “wuss,” but he’s not a wuss; he’s just not rash because he knows a reckless social mistake can bring life-changing tragedy in seconds. Most other nitpicks can be just as easily explained. For instance, a person can’t very well push someone into a well if they’re no longer in the area.

The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot at Cruickston Park, Cambridge, Ontario, and places nearby in the Kitchener/Cambridge region with studio stuff done in Toronto, which is just an hour’s drive east.

12767,"I always had a bit of a crush on Stephen Dorff, and his topless torso helps this start off quite promisingly. Sadly, that is the undoubted highlight in this otherwise really poor horror mystery. ""Cooper"" (Dennis Quaid) and his wife ""Leah"" (Sharon Stone) take their kids from the city to live in an old rural manor house. It needs a bit of work, and they hire in the son of the former owner ""Dale"" (Dorff) to help out. That's mistake number one as we quickly discover that this house might not be the family's most shrewd purchase. Mike Figgis tries quite hard to build and sustain a sense of menace here, but he is completely let down by a storyline that is far too thinly stretched and by a really lacklustre effort from both Stone and the really weak Quaid. It doesn't so much end, as just peter out - I couldn't have cared less about any of them and once Dorff put his shirt on, my interest waned completely. An early outing for Kristen Stewart and a pointless one for Christopher Plummer (who didn't even have to get out of bed) add quite literally nothing to this mundane thriller that is really light on thrill.",5.0
12772,"***Religious cons take advantage of the incurable human need for faith beyond the mundane***

“Leap of Faith” (1992) tackles the topic of a fraudulent traveling evangelist/faith healer played by Steve Martin. One of the trucks of his religious circus breaks down in a small town in Kansas and Jonas Nightingale (Martin) promptly takes advantage of the situation by holding a camp meeting. Debra Winger plays his assistant while Liam Neeson is on hand as the skeptical sheriff who smells a con. Lolita Davidovich plays a waitress Jonas sets his eyes on while Lukas Haas appears as her crippled brother. Jonas’ team includes the likes of Meat Loaf and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

This is a drama and not a comedy and owes a bit to the likes of “The Music Man” (1962), “Dream No Evil,” (1970) “Elmer Gantry” (1960) and “The Faith Healer” (1921). But it goes deeper into the philosophic wellsprings of human need: the quest for meaning in life and the longing for the eternal.

Jonas justifies his show on the grounds that it makes people feel better by entertaining and inspiring them. He works the crowd with what he has learned about human nature, zeroing in on those needing him the most with the help of his 'angels,' Jane (Winger) & crew. The average person throws $10-20 into the plate and they get entertainment and inspiration in return. They go home with a stronger faith. So what’s the problem?  The Sheriff, Will (interesting name), sees the scam, but also sees, like realists do, the hypnotic draw of religion and the corresponding faith. He settles for trying to reach one of whom he senses genuineness.

The drama is a mishmash of kinetic parts, mundane parts, disturbing parts and moments of wonder. The ending is great, though, in that it both entertains & inspires; and you leave with a good feeling, ironically just like the people who visit Jonas’ tent revival, lol.

The movie runs 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot entirely in the panhandle of Texas (Plainview, Groom, Tulia, Claude and Happy), plus studio stuff done in Irving.

12775,"***Moral ambiguities and barbaric reality in post-Medieval Europe***

At the beginning of the 16th century in plague-ridden Western Europe an uncouth band of lawless mercenaries led by the charismatic Martin (Rutger Hauer) kidnap a virgin noblewoman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) as revenge against a double-dealing Lord (Fernando Hilbeck). The tough commoners hole up in a small castle while the Lord’s son, Steven (Tom Burlinson), tries to save his betrothed (Leigh) with his militia.

While the events in ""Flesh+Blood"" (1985) take place just after the medieval period, it could be categorized as a medieval flick. It takes the general setting & color of “The Last Valley” (1971) and mixes-in the music & tone of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) with genius Basil Poledouris scoring both (although this score is nowhere near as notable). The film’s brutal grit and vulgarities influenced “Rob Roy” (1994) and the hole-up-in-a-castle plot was recycled in “Iron Clad” (2011). If you favor any of these movies you’ll probably appreciate ""Flesh+Blood” despite some overdone elements, like Susan Tyrrell’s verging-on-lunatic performance.

There are two conflicting factions: The nobles & their knights and the armed “commoners,” but neither are portrayed as the “good guys” and “bad guys.” Martin, for instance, is a bold and charismatic alpha male, but he’s also kind of scum; sorta the best of the worst. Steven easily stands out as the most gallant individual, but when he doesn’t get his way he pompously threatens retired-knight Hawkwood (Jack Thompson). At the end of the day this is a unique, adult-oriented film about using your natural gifts, including your wit & body, to survive in a barbaric disease-ridden reality. Memorable moments abound.

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot entirely in Spain. The Castilla-La Mancha was also used in El Cid (1961).

12775,"The supporting characters make this a classic.
Most classic films are that way.
This tale of Middle Ages blood and gore and survival is quite epic. Paul Verhoeven directs, so we can expect the ""in your face"" style that he's best at doing. 
There isn't the comic relief that you get in a lot of his movies. This is hard nosed action and blood.
I guess that's why it's ""Flesh+Blood"".
The romantic triangle are aging warrior Martin (Rutger Hauer), the plain blueblood virgin Agnes (Jennifer Leigh, who usually isn't this plain), and the nobleman's son, Steven (Tom Burlinson).
We get hints that Steven is heroic at first, compared to his wicked father who cheats his soldiers and does what he can for money.
Steven is a scholar who we are supposed to care about because he reads. Well, he quickly becomes a monster worse than his father. 
Martin actually works for the cardinal. In the Middle Ages, cardinals had little to do with ""Jesus"", and more to do with the estate of the church. Somehow, this cardinal is on the road, and cardinals were mercantile people, not religious people. They often kept small armies or bodyguards.
This cardinal has some very expert warriors. In fact, the most likable characters in the film are a pair of homosexual soldiers who bring sanity and reason to the antics of Martin and his chief rival of the soldiers, Summer. There is one other soldier, who is older yet than Martin, and is also a very likable character.
The women in the party with the cardinal and his soldiers are all much more gorgeous than Agnes, probably a statement about the blue blood royalty. The hottest girl of the group is also the most emotional, ready to satisfy the lusts of soldiers, and later weeping with the cardinal in remorse for her sins.
They become quarry for Steven when they attack him and his home grown soldiers, who are basically just peons who are enlisted without training. The cardinal has declared Martin their leader by a supernatural decree. Martin kidnaps Agnes, and Agnes pleads for him to be her only lover, and not let Summer touch her.
Martin gets involved with Agnes, who plays both ends against the middle. Steven chases them, with the help of the most interesting character on his team, Hawkwood.
One of the sidebars here is the medical practice of the day. A cleric doctor of the time finds that plague has entered the camp, and his backwards medicine is no match for the plague.
The characters are what make this a classic, as the two forces face off against each other. You'll likely find yourself caring more about the supporting characters like Hawkwood and the two homosexual soldiers and the ""mother"" than the major characters. And that's why this film is so special.",10.0

There's some enjoyable science from the young ""Steven"" who's quite adept at some sophisticated engineering and with explosives, JJL enters into the spirit of things quiet enthusiastically and Hauer is exactly the same as he is in ""Ladyhawke"" - also from this year, as his less is more dialogue delivery is coupled with a screen presence that only he could deliver. It's a bit on the long side, but there's plenty of action once it gets going and loads of frying pan to fire scenarios for everyone to escape from.

12779,"**_A romantic-comedy that's actually really good_**

A group of rich Americans take a private cruise from Greece to Italy where a spoiled middle-aged woman, Amber (Madonna), mentally abuses the crew, in particularly the first mate Pepe (Adriano Giannini) whom she constantly refers to as PeePee. The crew puts up with her pompous antics because she's the paying customer, but everything changes when Amber and Pepe are stranded on a deserted Island, putting Pepe in a position of control.

""Swept Away"" is a 2002 remake of the 1974 Italian film starring Madonna and directed/written by Madonna's (then) husband Guy Ritchie. Despite what you may have heard, it's fun and entertaining, but also thought-provoking and moving.

For the record, I'm not a follower of Madonna; I neither love her nor hate her. In fact, I almost didn't watch this film because she starred in it, but I gave-in because I'm a sucker for survival-on-deserted-island flicks. I'd also like to point out that I've never seen the original '74 film, so I have no nostalgic bias.

""Swept Away"" failed at the box office in 2002, but only because it was barely released to theaters and critics condemned it before it was even completed. It subsequently swept (away) the Razzies as the worst picture and a bandwagon effect developed with everyone jumping into the negative feeding frenzy.

Is it really THAT bad? No. Not even close. ""Swept Away"" starts as a fun, entertaining farce and morphs into a potent social commentary and, finally, a moving love story. The movie will make you laugh, make you angry, make you cry and ultimately move you -- no kidding. But it will only have this effect IF you refuse to listen to the drivel of the cookie-cutter critics and give it a chance.

As for Madonna, she's no Meryl Streep but she successfully makes you despise Amber in Act 1 and feel for her later on. She made me believe Amber was a real person. What more do you want?

I'm not an anti-capitalist but the film effectively points out the flaws of this system. It also effectively reveals how money/materialism can't of itself give true happiness, love or fulfillment. Amber had everything but was the most unhappy, loathsome person you'd likely ever meet.

One reviewer referred to the film as a ""wife beater's fantasy"" but failed to point out that it could just as easily be called a ""Man torturer's fantasy"" or ""Man emasculater's fantasy."" Let's be evenhanded with our appraisals.

I admit the physical abuse of Amber on the island (slapping, kicking and especially the faux-rape) is disturbing and almost tempted me to tune out, but then I saw what the filmmakers were shooting for, the filmmakers being Madonna and her husband.

In our society we've been misled to believe that mental abuse is less abusive because it's not physical. This film effectively shows that mental abuse can be just as bad, if not worse.

***SPOILER ALERT***

During the first half hour Amber horribly torments and emasculates Pepe (and others) because she's a spoiled brat and in control. When the tables are turned and she loses control on the island Pepe utilizes extreme measures to de-spoil Amber. In other words, Pepe realized that Amber was so far gone -- so utterly spoiled -- that she literally needed slapped back to reality.

This is in line with a biblical proverb ""Blows and wounds cleanse away evil and beatings purge the inmost being."" Let's face it, some people are so far gone (that is, spoiled) that they literally need the snot beat out of them -- that's the only thing that's going to wake 'em up to reality. Apparently Pepe realized this on the island and acted accordingly. Do I think he goes too far? Yes, but -- then again -- I wasn't the one mentally tormented for days on the boat and totally emasculated in front of others. Regardless, the story shows that his methods worked -- Amber was humiliated to the point of seeing life from a totally different perspective, a much-needed new perspective.

Pepe's discipline ultimately brings out spiritual character in Amber to the point where she refuses to call on passing boats to save her from her exile (two moving scenes, by the way). Why? Because she's been delivered from the bondage of selfishness, arrogance and materialism; she has experienced true love, fulfillment, team-work, companionship and independence (remember, she DOES learn how to fish for herself) for the first time in her life. It becomes more precious than gold to her and she doesn't want to let it go.

Again, I think Pepe goes too far with the physical abuse (in fact, I don't believe in physical ABUSE at all); he should've stopped with a couple of slaps, at most, but the filmmmakers are (evidently) saying she was so far gone that extreme measures were necessary. Besides, didn't she make her own bed, so to speak? Let her lie in it.

***END SPOILER***

The fact that Madonna -- one of the most successful women in history and the original ""material girl"" -- utilized this film to make this point speaks volumes. Is it a sign of weakness? No, it's a sign of enlightenment and spiritual strength.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Swept Away"" is much better than similar flicks like 1998's ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche. Why? Because, not only is it fun and entertaining, it's also thought-provoking and moving. Really, what more do you want from a stranded-on-a-deserted-island romantic-comedy? Needless to say, those who go overboard with the negative criticism need to get real.

The film runs a short-but-sweet 89 minutes and was filmed in Sardinia and Malta.

The DVD features a 20-minute making-of piece with Madonna and Guy Ritchie interviewing each other. It's an entertaining, informative and revealing piece. The DVD also features 16 deleted scenes.

12780,"This is a great kung-fu action film set in historical China. The fight choreography is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who has choreographed fighting in a number of great films, and later choreographed the fighting in The Matrix. His style is stamped all over the fights in the movie. As Kung Fu films go Iron Monkey has an  interesting story woven in among familiar tropes. You see plenty of thugs get their comeuppance and there are a few light comedy scenes as well. The story centres around the ""Iron Monkey"", a Robin Hood-like character who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, who has a Batman-like secret identity. It is much more than ""your kung-fu is no good, mine is better!"" and the main characters are genuinely likeable and well acted. I think the English voice actors do a pretty good job. The villains are cartoonish in their badness, and the heroes always win, which is typical of the genre. If you like the genre, this is definitely one worth watching.

12783,"**A good period film, visually magnificent, but with several flaws from the point of view of accuracy and historical rigor.**

Georgiana Cavendish, born Spencer, was one of the most interesting, remarkable and charismatic personalities in British society at the end of the 18th century. She made an enviable marriage, for the period, by marrying the 5th Duke of Devonshire, one of the richest and most powerful British peers. However, they had nothing in common: the duke was a man of few words and saw marriage as a means to an end: to have a legitimate male heir. Georgiana, on the other hand, was not content to be just a decorative figure or a child-bearer. Unhappy, she found herself so lonely that she decided to accept the sexual affair that her husband started with her best friend, Lady Foster, who moves in to their house and has adulterous children with him, in a humiliating ""ménage à trois"" which the Duchess supports in exchange for the friendship of Lady Foster, on whom she becomes emotionally dependent. To this day, the moral attitude of both women is debatable, and also the extent to which Lady Foster didn't seek, from the beginning, to replace Georgiana, whom she envied and befriended in equal measure.

For the rest, we know that the three elements of this love triangle were not faithful, keeping, each one for himself, other affairs and sexual engagements outside this arrangement. When the Duchess became pregnant by one of her lovers, the much younger Charles Gray, she was forced to travel to France, where she gave birth, maintaining for the rest of her life a close but discreet relationship with her adulterous daughter. Upon returning to London, Georgiana changed: by accepting her conjugal situation, she began to look for a series of escapes and distractions that would make her existence bearable: her presence at parties and balls made her a fashion icon, and her support for the Whig Party influenced the course of British politics at the time. The hapless Georgiana developed a ruinous gambling addiction, perhaps depression and even an eating disorder, factors that greatly contributed to her rapid decline in health. She died early, with many debts, many admirers and some literary works published.

All this is the short story of this intriguing historical figure. The film, directed by Saul Dibb and starring Keira Knightley, takes a very light approach to her life, and sometimes fails to be faithful to historical facts (warning), even though it delights us visually. In fact, the production values are high, and the highlight is clearly the detailed and well-made costumes, and the sets, many of them handpicked from the most luxurious palatial interiors, capable of instantly transporting us to the time. And context. Also, the cinematography and filming work were well done, as well as the soundtrack, signed by Rachel Portman, is very good, making good use of various pieces of baroque music. The biggest negative criticism I feel I have to make is the editing work, which makes us waste a lot of time on minor details, causing the film to take on an uneven pace. The sense of time passing was not done properly either: we never quite understand the passage of years, since the characters don't age and nothing changes.

As for the cast, I think it's fair to congratulate Keira Knightley's work. The actress already has a long history of period films and seems to have developed a certain predilection for this type of dramatic work, so I felt quite comfortable with the role and the character. The way she played opposite and related to Ralph Fiennes is very good, and the actor is excellent in the way he assumes the reserved, distant and sometimes rude ways of the duke, whom she makes an unpleasant and morally controversial figure. Hayley Atwell was also very good in the role of Lady Foster, although she was not able to give the character the moral nuances and ambiguity that the historical character deserved to have. The film also has good minor appearances from Charlotte Rampling and Simon McBurney. Dominic Cooper did what he could in the role of Charles Gray, but I couldn't help but think the actor was too old for the character, who was several years younger than the Duchess.",8.0

She is treated little better than a brood mare in fancy dress but has way to much independent spirit to settle for that and is soon having an affaire de coeur with Dominic Cooper ""Earl Grey"" (yes, he of the tea...). Meantime, the Duke has taken a mistress and so the film depicts how our multiple ménages-à-trois work out. It very much emphasises the (very) limited choices of women in 18th Century Britain - regardless of their status - but unfortunately, save for a few brief appearances by Charlotte Rampling - the characterisations were way too sterile for me.

He can easily turn an head or two when he walks into a room and so quickly realises that he can make some money ""entertaining"" the wealthier class of lady - already married or not, or even the occasion gentleman. As the Weimar Republic starts to give way to embryonic Naziism, the story also attempts to take a more serious track attempting to illustrate the profound societal changes in the city and the country whilst he and his clientele attempt to stay aloof and immune from the increasing anger and intolerance on the streets. It's really that attempt at the political that spoils this. Had it been left as a seedy story of a man using his beauty and, to an extent, his brains to get on in life then it have made for a decent watch. It doesn't though, it meanders all over the place mixing it's themes and delivering something that doesn't quite seem to know where it wants to go or who it's for. There's a decent enough effort from Sydne Rome as maybe the only honest woman in his life ""Cilly"" and there's a charming cameo from Marlene Dietrich who just about manages to, almost breathlessly, sing the title song but the rest of the cast seem underused and their characterisations undercooked to the point where I began to wonder if the likes of Kim Novak and Curd Jürgens just owed director David Hemmings a favour.

12877,"‘Dead Man’s Shoes’ is the fourth full-length feature film directed and written by Shane Meadows in 2004. Starring Paddy Considine, it tells the story of an ex-soldier who returns home to a small town in the Midlands seeking revenge on a group of thugs who have terrorised his younger brother. The film, at first, embraces the ultimate act of revenge with dark humour and disturbing violence, but soon turns out to criticise what effect vengeance has on the protagonist.

The film questions the role of masculinity in British working-class society by having very different male stereotypes thrown together in a very isolated environment. Not only does the film make a statement about gender roles, but more importantly, it tackles the issue of honour and justice. The audience’s allegiances sway dramatically throughout the film as Richard (Considine) becomes more brutal in his execution styles. A similar British film that challenges the audience’s perception of who is right is Stanley Kubrick’s ‘A Clockwork Orange’.

On simple viewing of this film, you could say that it is a revenge slasher-flick with plenty of gore; however, I feel that this film is a powerful piece of cinema that is a statement for the immorality of British society and the ideologies it imposes but it also uses Uttoxeter to show the corruption of human nature.

12919,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Steve Rash, “Can’t Buy Me Love” is a high school dramedy about a geek at an Arizona high school (Patrick Dempsey) who pays the most popular girl in school (Amanda Peterson) $1000 to act like she likes him for a month so he can move up the social strata. Of course, this creates unforeseen problems. Courtney Gains plays his geek friend and Seth Green his little brother.    

This is better than some 80’s teen flicks (e.g. Molly Ringwald’s movies), but not as good as others (“Fast Times at Ridgemont High”). It’s arguably on par with “Just One of the Guys” and “Some Kind of Wonderful.” Unlike those films, however, it has a semi-campy vibe wherein the cast members often exaggerate their lines in an artificial way, which telegraphs that what’s happening isn’t real. 

If you can roll with this odd element, there’s a lot of good in “Can’t Buy Me Love” and the ending is genuinely moving. There are many serious/realistic scenes, like the notable airplane graveyard sequence. The two protagonists have good chemistry and their relationship arc is convincing. Tina Caspary (Barbara) and Darcy DeMoss (Patty) are serviceable on the fringe female front.

Can't Buy Me Love is directed by Steve Rash and written by Michael Swerdlick. It stars Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson. Music is by Robert Folk and cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister.

Plot has Dempsey as nerdy outcast Ronald Miller, who fed up of not being popular pays Cindy Mancini (Peterson), the most popular girl in school, one thousand dollars to be his girlfriend.

The 1980s was awash with films of this ilk, the teen dramedy topped up by a big hearted message and a finale of punch the air worth. What it all comes down to is if the film can hold its head above water, not become too twee, and crucially have you smiling come the finale. As evidenced by its popularity among 80s cineastes of a certain age, Can't Buy Me Love delivers all that you expect from such fare.

The core theme is of course self acceptance, the attainment of such in amongst the scary world of teenage school years. This shines bright in spite of some rather unconvincing dialogue and contrived corny moments. Director Rash just about holds it together, ensuring that the charm of the lead actors holds weight for character engagement, even though for thematic depth the screenplay only skims over the surface.

The teenage dramedy would evolve considerably once the 80s was left behind, becoming more biting, daring and observational. Yet for those who lived and loved this type of film in the 80s, there's a lovely nostalgic glow to be gleaned from revisits to the likes of Can't Buy Me Love. Nothing wrong with that. 6.5/10",7.0
12921,"**A film so silly that you can't help but laugh.**

I don't think Shakespeare ever imagined that one of his most iconic works could be the clear inspiration for such a wildly comical film: in fact, the relationship between the film and “Hamlet” is obvious to anyone who has the plot and characters in mind. famous play by the English Bard. Here, we have two comical characters with an obsession with beer (who will probably be guaranteed entry, without explanation, into Alcoholics Anonymous) who go, completely inadvertently, to a brewery and stumble upon a Machiavellian scheme to remove the heiress from the company to the detriment of from an uncle.

The film is complete nonsense from beginning to end, and it even seems painful to see how the two main characters go through so much without having any real idea of what is happening around them. They don't look drunk, but they look like they're on drugs all the time. The film is funny, you can't help but laugh... but at the same time it's not a film I would want to show to a teenage audience. After all, many of them already drink too much and smoke things they shouldn't...

The cast includes several well-known names who seem to have embarked on this project for fun and not, exactly, for the expected financial return. This is the case of Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis, who made several other films with the same characters and achieved some public recognition for it. I also liked seeing Max von Sydow, perhaps the most dense and professional actor present. I don't know Lynne Griffin, but I liked her work here and Paul Dooley was a laughable enough villain to not deserve our hate.",3.0

Split Second is directed by Tony Maylam and Ian Sharp and written by Gary Scott Thompson. It stars Rutger Hauer, Kim Cattrall and Neil Duncan. It was filmed in London, England, predominantly at the Hartley Jam Factory in Southwark, with Clive Tickner the cinematographer.

London, 2008. 

""After forty days and nights of torrential rain, the city is largely submerged below water, a result of the devastating effects of continued global warming. The warnings ignored for decades have now resulted in undreamed of levels of pollution where day has become almost endless night..."" 

and something is stalking the watery city and tearing hearts out of its victims...

Plot follows a familiar course, and in truth there's no surprises here. A psychic link between Stone and the killer is sadly never fully formed, which is a shame because it had the potential to make the film more interesting. To offset that though, is that there is some nice babble involving astrological and satanic matters which are thrown up during the search/investigation. In its favour as well, is that Maylam and his team sensibly keep the perpetrator hidden for most of the film, instead choosing the odd flashing glimpse of a clawed hand, or a murky torso running across the frame, while the idea to only show the bloody aftermath of a kill hits home harder than if we had actually viewed it.

The look is spot on for an apocalyptic sci-fi piece, all greys, silvers and low lights, while the cheap production design works well in context of the tone of the picture. There's even some Schwarzenegger like cheese dialogue, the likes of which the big Austrian would have got paid millions to speak at around the same time Split Second was released. The killer, once revealed, will disappoint many, mainly because it looks overly familiar, but it does impact for the finale set at a flooded tube station. While the music (co-scored by three different people) is ideal as it sounds very tinny, in fact it's very 1980's like.

Judging by the critical reaction to it you have to think some folk were taking it a bit too seriously. Never fully convincing as a lead man, Hauer pitches this just right, with tongue in cheek, a grizzled personage and a swagger to match the glint in is eyes. He's playing a burned out cop character called Harley Stone, his partner, who of course is the polar opposite, is named Dick Durkin! Take this seriously? Never! Cattrall is merely here to be a love interest, to scream and show some flesh for the discerning hound dog, while her haircut, some black dyed German Helmet effort, is totally unflattering. Duncan does a fine job as the nerdy copper, working the comedy off of Hauer very well, while fleeting support comes from great British actors Alun Armstrong and Pete Postlethwaite. In cameos we get song man Ian Dury and Michael J. Pollard.

Deception is directed by Marcel Langenegger and written by Mark Bomback. It stars Ewen McGregor, Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams. Music is by Ramin Djawadi and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.

Jonathan McQuarry (McGregor) is a timid New York accountant who whilst working late one night meets Wyatt Bose (Jackman). Bose is the complete opposite to McQuarry, he's highly sexed, confident and supremely cool. So when a mix up with the pair's mobile phones introduces McQuarry to an exclusive sex group, he's spun into a world completely alien to him.

If you have watched a lot of film noir, both classic era and neo, Deception will come off as irritatingly stale. What we have here is very much a case of the title revealing far too much! You would hope that with the makers going for broke with such a title then they would have the nous to fill out the story with surprises, take us and the principal characters down some twisty streets, not so, sadly. Within ten minutes you catch on to what is happening, the writing so poor as to not cleverly challenge the narrative drive. It could maybe be argued that McQuarry's journey, and how the character evolves, is something of a veer from the noir norm? But it has no dramatic worth and renders the finale as dull (the alternate ending is even worse).

It's not a total wash out as such, the cast are engaging in their roles, good actors straining to make a weak screenplay work, while cameos from Natasha Henstridge, Charlotte Rampling and Maggie Q impact to come off as better than novelty value. And then there's Spinotti's (Manhunter, L.A. Confidential, Heat) cinematography, the best character in the play. His nighttime city scapes are electric, his colour lenses beautiful (golds and blues are poetic), his work deserves a better film. But that's about it, leaving us with a shallow noir cover version that's in search of its own identity. For those not familiar with the noir form, then this is just about average enough for a look see. For noir fans, though, it's neither erotic or thrilling and as unadventurous as it gets. 5/10",5.0

However, honestly, despite that it was pretty fair. It actually made more of a point to detail how Enron got to the place that brought convictions rather than doing a straight hit-piece on the corporation.

In other words, there is really a lot of meat on the bone here and it does a decent job of detailing the evolution of the company and why it turned out the way it did, rather than just focusing on the political mess that it created as one would have expected on a film covering this topic, and one with a fairly snarky title at that.

There is a lot to learn from watching this, particularly because the scandal that engulfed the company was NOT the primary focus, but rather how it came to the scandal. And that, I really believe, is what the film should be about.

It had a story to tell and it told it well, surprisingly well for a film that promised to be a hit-piece. We actually need more things like this. It was refreshing that it covered the circumstances and, most importantly, the hows rather than focusing on the results of Enrons actions.

13022,"Never smile at a crocodile. Don't be taken in by his welcome grin.

Rogue is co-produced, written and directed by Greg Mclean (Wolf Creek). It stars Michael Vartan, Radha Mitchell, Sam Worthington & John Jarratt. The film is inspired by the true story of ""Sweetheart"", a giant Australian crocodile that terrorised boats in a 5 year period between 1974 & 1979. Plot sees travel journalist Pete McKell (Vartan) in the Northern Territory of Australia finishing off his latest feature. With time to kill he joins a river boat cruise led by spunky local lass Kate Ryan (Mitchell). So along with assorted other tourists, they set off up river. Where after a tricky encounter with a couple of local nuisances, one of the tourists spies a distress flare further up stream, then another, and another. As captain of the boat, Kate is duty bound to respond to aid anyone who may be in distress on the waters. However, this means straying into ""sacred waters"" and before they know it, they are in the middle of the hunting ground of a gigantic crocodile - who promptly attacks the boat and forces the group onto the nearest mini island, an island that is in tidal waters and the tide is coming in...

Upon viewing Rouge it would seem that it may be one of the most unfortunate horror releases of the time. It barely got a theatrical release outside of its own country (practically one week in selected cinemas in America & Europe), and it came out at a time when killer-croc movies were appearing almost every other month; Primeval, Black Water and Lake Placid 2 (good grief) all ""surfaced"" (hrr hrr hrr) during 2007 to take a ""chomp"" (ok I'll stop now) of the movie watching public. This following on from the sub-genre of aquatic reptile horror movies already being well served by Steve Miner's Lake Placid (1999) & Lewis Teague's Alligator (1980), both of which have huge fan bases. It's all relevant because Rogue happens to be the best of the bunch, a snappy (sorry, couldn't resist), scary, fun and slickly produced Aussie movie. It's sickening that reams of sub-standard horror remakes get wide distribution whilst something like this, that deserves the chance at least, can't. The Weinstein Bothers should be ashamed of themselves for the treatment of Mclean's film.

Straight away we should make clear that, as its certification suggests, Rouge is not particularly bloody. Those in need of sequence after sequence of a crocodile tearing humans limb from limb need not seek this film out. While it is in no way able to live with Lake Placid in terms of being ""intentionally"" humorous, thus comedy seekers should approach with caution, what Rogue does offer is a movie that's tightly structured and paced to precision. Packed with suspense, Mclean affords the characters some time to actually impact on the story. The first half hour is technically sublime, as we get to know the various folk on board the boat, we are treated to gorgeous cinematography from Will Gibson (location the estuaries of the Northern Territory), accompanied by one of the most pleasingly orchestral scores ever laid down for a creature feature (François Tetaz - with the nods to Jaws being just fine). All of this of course serves to offer up the calm before the inevitable storm, from where Mclean then follows the marker set by Jaws by not giving us full sight of the croc. It's the ultimate tease until the attacks start, but even then its mostly teasing suggestion, so the tension mounts as we couple it with our own imagination.

What unfolds from here is a series of set pieces as our stranded group try to avoid becoming crocodile lunch. Here normally a film of this ilk shows dumb people doing dumb things, but Mclean shows respect to the genre and its fans by having some of these folk do silly yet understandable things, thus the scares are elicited by way of believable reactions. And of course the situation brings out the best and worst from most of them since peril has a funny way of doing this to a human being. Also of note here is that Mclean doesn't make the croc a monster, this is merely a hungry animal protecting its territory. A quick piece of dialogue earlier in the story had pointed to hunters possibly being the ones who fired the distress flares, as croc goes about his snarly way, it doesn't hurt to remember this pertinent fact. The cast all give credible performances, notably the handsome hero in waiting Vartan, Mitchell (who was becoming something of a screen queen darling back then) & Jarratt, who shows us a different string to his acting bow than the one he played as loony Mick Taylor in Wolf Creek.

The movie has flaws, but they are few and far between. The croc on appearance will irk some people, so it's true that Mclean could have done better there, while one ""WTF"" turn of events loses impact as the director isn't as bold to follow through like he did in Wolf Creek, but they are forgivable irks. For as we find ourselves holding our breaths during the creepy and practically silent finale, that culminates in a fine ""B"" movie bit of outrageousness, we realise that above all else it's been the suspense and ominous foreboding that made this one damn effective thriller. Mclean appeared to be holding a grudge against his native country, his first two films back then were hardly enticing the tourists to explore the gorgeous lands of Australia! What ever his means or motivation, long may it continue if he keeps producing films like this. Lets hope that his future projects are not as ignored as this one was, because for sure there is a very good director here and it would be tragic should a talent be burned by how his movie was handled.

Big Brother gets a reboot and delivers as fun a genre picture as was released in 2008. Yes it's total nonsense, but really the critics venting spleen on this one must have gone through a popcorn entertainment bypass prior to viewing it. Director D.J. Caruso continues his Hitckcockian leanings by following his surprisingly fun ""Disturbia"" with this ""North By Northwest"" type concept that meets a host of the genre staples, where the influences are very hard to miss. Yet as daft as it is, and it is folks, ""Eagle Eye"" knits well together to play out as a highly accomplished piece, the action is first rate, in fact on big screens the two main sequences explode with joyous action abandon. This isn't found wanting on the thriller front either, it's safe to say that no new ground is to be found as we get to the tick tock countdown finale, but Caruso, and writers John Glenn & Travis Wright, have spliced together a series of wholly interesting and thrilling strands. So much so that the finale is disappointingly unable to quite deliver on the promise of the prior build up.

Shia LaBeouf seemed destined to be a young actor who had to earn even the smallest bit of respect, where much like DiCaprio at the time, you felt LaBeouf was likely to get better notices later in his career. After being sidekicks to John McLaine, Indiana Jones, and erm, Optimus Prime, LaBeouf here earned his acting spurs and carries the film with a charm and credibility that the daftness of the piece doesn't quite deserve. Shia is helped enormously by a strong female lead, Michelle Monaghan has an impressive ability to sweat strength whilst channelling believable emotional turmoil, and her interplay with LaBeouf is the heartbeat of the picture. Of the rest, Michael Chiklis is a bit underused, but this is offset by Billy Bob Thornton continuing that knack of being one of the most watchable actors of his generation. Rosario Dawson is sadly weak in this and William Sadler is barely noticeable, conversely though a nod of approval goes to Anthony Mackie who shines in a crucial sequence towards the end.

My first viewing was when I went to the cinema with the then two ladies in my life, we were a bit early and sat in the foyer for a while, we watched as they were queuing out the door for ""High School Musical 3"" and weird looking people were trundling in to see ""Saw 5"". There were a total of 12 people in the cinema to see ""Eagle Eye"" on its second week run, at a peak viewing time as well. That was a damn shame because ""Eagle Eye"" may well be a dumb and fun action/thriller picture, but it's not pro-porting to be anything else, and really film's with honest entertainment intent are to be treasured and used for why they are made for in the first place.

13056,"***The best of the Punisher movies with a weak last act***

The Punisher first appeared in the Spider-Man comic in February, 1974, and became a semi-regular foe/ally in that mag, but was more apt to appear in Daredevil in the 80s until the character got his own mini-series in 1986 and then his ongoing titles: The Punisher (1987), The Punisher War Journal (1988) and The Punisher War Zone (1992). The character was so popular at the time that he inspired a black & white magazine as well (1989).

The reason The Punisher was and continues to be so popular is because he's essentially an over-the-top version of ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Deathwish"": Frank Castle's family is killed by the mob while on a picnic in Central Park and so he declares war on all criminals wherein he becomes their judge, jury and executioner. Unlike Daredevil, a lawyer who utilizes the justice system, The Punisher just kills 'em all.

The first movie version was 1989's ""The Punisher"" with Dolph Lundgren, which was a disappointment. Lundgren was good, but the movie was too Grade B cartoony and it took too many liberties. Still, some consider it a cult flick. The 2004 movie with Thomas Jane curiously transferred the character from New York City to sunny Florida, specifically the Tampa area. There were other oddities that didn’t sit well, but Jane was good as the protagonist and there was enough good in the flick to marginally enjoy it.

This 2008 rendition, “Punisher: War Zone,” was originally intended to be a sequel to the 2004 movie with Thomas Jane, but delays in the production caused him to pull out. Lexi Alexander ultimately got the gig as director and she pitched the idea of doing the film “as a throwback to '80s era action films” with 6’4” Ray Stevenson taking over as The Punisher.

Jigsaw (Dominic West) makes for a memorable villain with Loony Bin Jim an entertaining wacko sidekick (Doug Hutchison). Wayne Knight plays Microchip and Julie Benz the wife of an undercover agent that Castle mistakenly kills on one of his missions. The towering Colin Salmon stands out as a police agent intent on tracking down The Punisher.

It was a good call to bring the story back to New York City and, honestly, this has to be one of the best-looking big city movies I’ve ever seen, no kidding. The cinematography/locations/lighting are exceptional. While the movie has the urban grittiness of Nolan’s Batman trilogy, it balances it out with amusing cartoonish-ness. There is some quality drama, like Castle’s anguish over killing a “good guy” and his dealings with the dead agent’s widow & daughter, but it’s not overlong and dull like in “Batman Begins” (2005) and “The Dark Knight” (2008). Unfortunately, the last act, while serviceable, could’ve been better.

At the end of the day, “Punisher: War Zone” edges out the 2004 movie as the best film version of the character. It’s more faithful to the comics and overall more entertaining even though it totally bombed at the box office.

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes and was shot in Montreal, Quebec.

GRADE: B/B-",7.0
13056,"To be fair, Punisher: War Zone is the most accurate representation of the comic we've had to date. The gore, extreme violence, and borderline sadism is very much a part of the comic. Ray Stevenson is spot on as Frank Castle. Dominic West is not so good as Jigsaw but at least his gang is more competent than Travolta's.

Given that this came out in the same year as two other big comic book movies, there is one big thing that Punisher: War Zone contributes: proof that a female director can make an unforgivingly cruel but kick ass action flick, so I don't understand how more of them aren't being given the opportunity to do so.",5.0

13090,"The first thing that went through my head the second Sunshine Cleaning ended, was 'I could have gone on watching for at least another hour'. Not just because it ended a little abruptly, but mostly because I so thoroughly enjoyed this film, that I was seriously disappointed when it was over. It's like that book that's so compelling that you just want to inhale every word, but dread to actually finish.

Sunshine Cleaning is about two sisters, who, driven by dire financial straits, decide to start ""a biohazard removal/crime scene clean-up service"", cleaning up the houses of people who died gruesome deaths. The premise is fairly simple, but executed in a very lovely, heart-warming way, half tragedy – half comedy. Because of course, this film is not only about cleaning up other people's mess, but also about cleaning up some of their own baggage along the way, especially when the sisters are confronted with the memory of a death akin to what is now their daily business. Somewhere in between all this they have to deal with their eccentric father, the elder sister's peculiar son, love, loss, failure and a glimmer of hope. Reading this back now I realise this actually sounds really cheesy and sentimental, but I would have hated it if it was. Trust me.

Amy Adams plays Rose, the eldest of the two, and Emily Blunt plays Norah, the rebellious younger sister. Rarely have I seen such great chemistry and energy between a leading pair. These two women make it seem like they've been working together for years, and physically they're a perfect match too, they actually look they could be sisters. Rose is obviously the mature, sensible one, whereas Norah just kind of takes things as they come, not worrying and not taking responsibility for her life. Though they seem to be bound not so much by kinship, but rather by a mutual fate and childhood hardship that has left its mark on both of them, although they deal with it very differently. Rose tries desperately to build a better life for herself and her son, but rarely finds any luck on her path. Norah just wings it and refuses to grow up.

Both Amy Adams and Emily Blunt prove to have great star quality and talent, and I think I can now officially call myself a fan of both. They are raw and real, one is sweet and the other is sour, without overacting anything. Alan Arkin is great as their dad. Eccentric, bitter yet loving, idealistic and seemingly in a mild state of denial. He plays pretty much the same character as in that other (great!) film of Sunshine Cleaning's producers, Little Miss Sunshine, where he also played the grumpy granddad. This type of role seems to be custom-made for him. Another great part is played by professional chameleon Clifton Collins, Jr. He plays Winston, the owner of a cleaning supplies shop, and he turns out to be that small shimmer of good luck that Rose so desperately needs. Actually, everyone in this film is so perfectly cast that it almost seems like this is a real family, in a real situation. It just doesn't feel contrived in any way, despite the lack of originality and obvious pitfalls where the story could have easily crashed and burned into a wasteland of melodrama and false sentiment. But like I mentioned earlier, this doesn't happen at any point. Usually when a film is on the borderline of becoming a total cliché, and yet works out successfully, it is because of one or maybe two factors. However, with Sunshine Cleaning, it's all of them. Cast, screenplay, dialogue, direction, camera work, production, just everything is wonderful. I'm actually running out of superlatives to describe this film.

I'm inclined to give this film 10 stars, however there is just one small thing that kind of failed in my opinion and that's the ending. Nothing wrong with it story-wise, it just ended so abruptly that it feels like they literally ran out of tape. It actually kind of threw me off. But... oh, what the heck, this film deserves 10 stars, easily.

In conclusion, Sunshine Cleaning is just a beautifully crafted story about falling (hard) and getting back up on your feet again. It has a real indie-feel to it, it's basically just a pretty little art house gem. Funny thing – while I'm writing this, 4 Non Blondes' ""What's Up"" is playing in the background, and it feels strangely appropriate to the feeling of this film. So if you want to know what to expect of Sunshine Cleaning, listen to that song, it really captures the essence of the story. 

I can't think of much more to say to sell this film, all I can do is strongly recommend Sunshine Cleaning to pretty much anyone and everyone. It's wonderful.

13105,"Megan and I are starting to watch the same TV shows - and I'm liking them. I'm losing it!

Mr. Mom is directed by Stan Dragoti and written by John Hughes. It stars Michael Keaton, Teri Garr and Martin Mull. Music is by Lee Holdridge and cinematography by Victor J. Kemper. Plot sees Keaton as Jack Butler, who after being laid off from work, is forced to become a house husband after his wife Caroline (Garr) lands a good job with Schooner Tuna - something he's really not cut out to do.

Ah, well, look, it's obviously very eighties, and thankfully society has moved on in leaps and bounds since this film was released. But good honest comedy is just that, honest, and for those looking for a good chuckle whilst admiring the talent of a pre-Batman Keaton, Mr. Mom is a bad mood lifter. Condensed into the 90 minute running time are enough gags and fun sequences to fill out a 12 episode sit-com, with a pre-teen-angst trail blazing John Hughes scripting it full of quotable lines. Lines which Keaton delivers with the comic timing not befitting someone just starting out in film.

The fun is mined from Jack being hopeless at basic household chores whilst badly tending the three young children at the same time. Enter scenes involving shopping, dropping the kids off at school, laundry, cooking and ironing. As his masculinity starts to wane, Jack starts too slob out and gets his kicks by watching day-time soap operas and playing cards with the neighbourhood women. This coincides with his wife Caroline (Garr adorable) advancing well at work, but paying a price for it by being away from the family home far too much. There's also the looming presence of Caroline's smarmy boss (Martin Mull delightfully sleazy) and the good time girl (Ann Jillian sexing it up) who has her eye on Jack for fun and frolics. Both of these are stereotypes, but they existed then as much as they exist now, with that, it's easy to cut Mr. Mom some slack.

Supporting slots fall to Christopher Lloyd (who would re-team with Keaton for the very funny ""The Dream Team"" in 1989), Jeffrey Tambor (""City Slickers""), Graham Jarvis (TV ""Starsky & Hutch/Cagney & Lacey"") and Miriam Flynn (""National Lampoon's Vacation""). The child actors put in pleasing turns, where they score funny points both visually and orally, and director Dragoti (""The Man With One Red Shoe"") directs in an unfussy natural way. Ultimately it's Keaton and Hughes' script that lifts it to better comedy heights, the latter of which also plays on some basic fears that arise in the real world. Yeah, it's not just about Jack's bumbling around the home, that John Hughes was a sharp fella you know. 7/10",7.0
13121,"Girls have a natural modesty.

Teeth is based around the myth of vagina dentate, where it was believed that in some ladies a set of teeth were hiding away in their vagina. The lady in question here is Dawn O’Keefe (Jess Wexler), a comely virgin, teenage spokesperson for Christian abstinence, from a very young age it was clear something was not right.

A great and interesting premise is never truly fulfilled for maximum potential here, but with slices of dark humour, some cringe inducing prosthetic gore and a bold performance from Wexler, Mitchell Lichtenstein’s film safely keeps its head above mediocrity.

The makers are dallying with a number of unsubtle themes, from female empowerment to the fear of sex in general, and of course the perils of letting shallow hormones dictate the teenage mandate. There’s even dashes of obsession, religio slights and a meditation on grief that earths the electricity buzzing about the hormonal place.

Thankfully, Lichtenstein keeps away from I Spit On Your Grave territory, finding a nice balance for Dawn, she is a character bombarded with a myriad of emotional conflicts, but hysteria does not dominate her make-up, and she’s never cartoonish either. View it more as a genre splicer than outright horror and better rewards await the interested observer. 6/10",6.0

Well a trip to the lake for some swimming then a blanket-huddle in cave afterwards would suggest not - though almost immediately poor old ""Tobey"" wishes he'd kept his pants on and she is heading to the doctor to find out just what happened. When the doctor also ends up on the operating table we are faced with the indisputable truth. She has been landed with an ancient Egyptian or Persian or Roman curse that is going to make sex a very dangerous thing for the bloke! Rather entertainingly, though, she decides that this could actually be put to good use - and her obnoxious brother ""Brad"" (John Hensley) might just get a taste of her newly found medicine. Aside from watching it with your legs crossed - regardless of which sex you are - this is mildly entertaining in a squirmy sort of fashion.

13122,"The plot follows a boy and two adult thieves who, after breaking in to steal a collection of rare coins, become trapped in a house belonging to a strange couple. These thieves are so inept they leave their van parked next to the house, in full view of a couple of policemen who are even more inept; “This truck was used to rob a liquor store last night,” they inform the homeowners, whereupon they just drive off, leaving the getaway vehicle right where it is (but then cops are always incompetent in a Wes Craven film; cf. The Last House on the Left).

The inside of the house, which appears to have been designed by serial killer H.H. Holmes, is full of booby traps, including a door whose knob has been rigged to deliver electric shocks – in one hilarious scene, young Fool (Brandon Quintin Adams) grabs the doorknob with one hand while holding Leroy's (Ving Rhames) hand with the other; Leroy’s other hand is currently between a Rottweiler’s fangs, and the electrical charge travels through the two intruders and knocks out the dog.

The People Under the Stairs is like a Scooby Doo episode with a lot more blood in it; it’s indeed so ludicrous that the stolen coins are meant to pay for “mom's operation.” Having said that, there’s no question it was Craven’s intention all along to make a comedy. Moreover, it's impossible not to have a soft spot for a movie that includes a kid punching a Rottweiler in the face, an homage to The Shining, and the aforementioned dog going on an unexpected ride down a homemade slide, all in the space of just over three minutes.",6.0
13153,"This ranks alongside **KING OF NEW YORK** as a spiritual not-quite-sequel to **YEAR OF THE DRAGON**. Let's put a few of the same characters in Chicago, with Raymond J. Barry in essentially the same role (though now even more overtly crooked and with the FBI) and swap out that Thai drug baron John Lone visited with Tzi Ma and  now throw in Bruce Lee's son into the mix. Bring in horror director Dwight H. Little (fresh off his other successful action outing **MARKED FOR DEATH**) and see what we get?

Well, the results are a bit of a mixed bag for sure. While the action sequences are largely okay, the plot doesn't really throw us any surprises. The romance between Brandon and a female police officer falls flat on its face and the surrogate father-son dynamic he has with grizzled cop Powers Boothe feels similarly forced and awkward. Also, why is a big Chinese drug shipment being brought in via the Port of Chicago when anywhere on the West Coast would be 1000x more convenient? Plot contrivances galore, plus a really goofy Tienamen Square flashback make for just a little too much dumb writing to take seriously.

That said, Brandon Lee, though still a bit rough around the edges, is tremendously charismatic as the lead. His character seems very much a humanized fish out of water and his handling of the numerous martial arts sequences makes us lament his untimely passing that much more. Dwight's action highlights come near the start with a very John Woo inspired shootout in an art gallery and reach their crescendo mid-movie with a hapless gang of Italian wannabe mobsters turning their besieged restaurant HQ into a fortress. 

Nick Mancuso, the primary antagonist of the picture, really shines as a somehow likable pathetic wimp of a mob boss. He's a lot of fun to watch, and its unfortunate that his character leaves the film prior to the third act, which turns into a straight-up dig on John Woo with a very low-stakes cliched battle in a Chinese... laundromat / factory (???). Both Tzi Ma and Al Leong get in some quality martial arts time with Brandon, but it's still so much more fun to see him in a fisticuffs match with giant brute Tony Longo in that mid-movie restaurant scene.

As it is, **Rapid Fire** has a lot of fun 80's/early-90's-style action in it and sits comfortably next to the likes of **RAW DEAL** and **HARD TO KILL** in terms of quality. Had it not been saddled with a lame script that plays its cards way too soon, it could have been a lot more.

13154,"We've got a problem here. There are more bad guys than we've got bullets.

It's a buddy buddy action movie, one that feels more 80s than 90s, with that it has all the pluses and minuses that comes with such genre staples. Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee pair up to take on The Yakuza, Dolph has a very personal reason for tracking and killing the Yakuza leader. They are an odd pair who must get over their initial differences to complete their mission. Sound familiar? Well it is, because it can be seen in a whole host of other action buddy buddy movies.

The acting is sub-standard but the action is well constructed, which at the end of the day is what action fans require for a rollicking good time. Some of the dialogue is too cheese worthy to even pass as acceptable - and this in a genre that often demands it as a requisite, while the overt homoerotic undercurrents are either meant as tongue in cheek? Or an attempt by the makers to make some sort of action movie statement?

Talking of the onscreen lot, Jean Marsh as Princess Mombi is the only performance I felt entertained by - she's very good. Away from her, there's not much to note. Fairuza Balk is solid in the role of Dorothy, nothing really to say about her other than she does an OK job; considering her age. The Wheelers are kinda interesting, they do look cool.

It's a shame they don't make use of Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man - the latter I'm actually glad they didn't, given how awful his design was. I get why they don't feature more, given the source material, but it feels a needless change-up especially with Billina, Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead being so lame.

I was too young in 1999 to remember this World Trade Organization meeting. However, I am fully aware that this type of summit is usually a rallying point for demonstrators in favor of a thousand ideals: rebels without a cause, anarchists, socialists, communists, environmentalists, conspiracy theorists...

I don't really know what happened, but there is no doubt that these protests were violent and, to a certain extent, they managed to achieve their objectives, severely disrupting the summit and the life of the city, and becoming a juicier and more relevant matter than the summit itself. In the following summits, there was more care. I could make a series of considerations around the real usefulness of the WTO, or even if there aren't other ways to encourage a greater trade flow and greater ease in commercial exchanges between countries, making it possible to end this, apparently questionable, organization. But one thing I learned in my life: the owners of money usually win these wars, even if they lose some battles along the way.

The film is very competently directed by Stuart Townsend. The director does not hide that his heart and admiration are with the protesters in the streets, and the film is not neutral about that. Thus, we witness the glorification of peaceful protests, the demonization of authorities (even though the police are portrayed as men who only do their job) and even the exposure of many of those who, under the cover of protests, broke and burned things just because it seemed a good idea. Personally, I would have preferred a more neutral approach, because if the idea was to demonize the economy and the WTO, it should have been better contextualized.

The cast has some well-known names, and Martin Henderson turns out to be one of the actors who deserve our applause. He's done a good job, he's in excellent shape, and he's used the material he's been given very well to give personality and depth to his character. I also really liked the performance of Charlize Theron, in the role of her wife. Ray Liotta is very good in the role of a mayor who is overtaken by events. The rest of the cast, however, I felt didn't stand out, and didn't do much more than they really had to.

The film has an extraordinary cinematic beauty, as it manages to recreate very well what was experienced on the streets during those days in December 1999. The way in which everything was recreated is pleasantly aesthetic without losing any kind of credibility or realism.

13183,"The comic book geek blockbuster for adults only.

Watchmen is directed by Zack Snyder and adapted to screenplay by David Hayter and Alex Tse from the Alan Moore/David Gibbons graphic novel. It stars Patrick Wilson, Malin Ackerman, Billy Crudup, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Carla Gugino and Matt Frewer. Music is by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Larry Fong.

1985 and someone is killing all our superheroes. Time for the remaining super heroes to band together - but what they find as they fight the good fight is potential annihilation for everyone.

It was quite a battle getting Watchmen onto the screen, over twenty years of legal wrangling and controversies, it got to the point where fans of the source material doubted it would ever happen - and even if it did it was sure to be a monstrous failure. How pleasing to find that not only did it make it to the screen, but it is also a genre bending winner - well to some of us of course...

One has to take into context just how potent and original the graphic novel was back in 1986/7, we are dealing with very mature themes, superheroes with serious psychological baggage. Alan Moore lit the touch paper in the comic book kingdom that the rest have since followed to keep the torch burning well into the new millennium. Snyder has achieved top line results in getting both the feel and look of the source, even if some of Moore's cunning cynicism has been lost in translation.

Story is set right in the middle of nuclear paranoia and the fear of the Soviets in 85, the America we view is dank and depressing, noirish in vibe (aided by Rorschach's clobber and detective inclinations), it's a world on the road to nowhere. We are also at a time in the alternate world where superheroes are banned from operating, forcing The Watchmen to become vigilantes - that is if they can get along and shunt their psycho discord to one side. The back stories of the main protagonists are fully formed, and these are not jolly characters, so much so you worry the fate of mankind is doomed if these are who we rely on to save us.

There was in no way that Snyder would be able to produce a comic book filmic adaptation that would be as worshipped in that sphere, to rival that of the worship the novel has in its own. However, coming at it as someone who only sought out the source material after seeing the film, it shines bright for newcomers who are ironically seeking darker tints in superhero tales. Oh it has the requisite nifty twists (a clinical mystery to be unearthed), booming visuals, excellent effects work and smartly constructed action set-pieces, but narratively it's moody and calls for the utmost attention on dialogue passages (I have found it gets better on repeat viewings).

Snyder clearly cared about the project and that love is evident in the movie. It was never going to appease all and sundry, but at worst to hardcore Moore fans it's at least an honourable failure, to many others it's a smart and stylishly refreshing genre booster. 8/10",8.0

First of all, this review is based on the theatrical version of Watchmen. Usually, Director's Cuts or Ultimate Editions are not preferred over the original release. Few films benefit from them, and most are simply an extended cut with a bunch of deleted scenes. It's only fair and rational that a reviewer watches the version which the whole world saw at the theaters at the respective time. With that said, despite knowing the story of the source material, I never indeed read it. Having in mind that most of the ""hate"" that this Zack Snyder's movie received is from comic-book purists (basically, every book/comic/game/whatever-lover who defends that any cinematic adaptations of any of these sources MUST be 100% the same, with no modifications whatsoever), I'm certain an unbiased perspective is the way to go.

And overall, this is a good feature. Watchmen isn't just another CBM (comic-book movie). It doesn't just follow one hero vs. one villain. It's a whole world (in today's standards, it's really a cinematic universe) of ""superheroes"" meant to be explored in fine detail (hence the release of a TV show today... reviewing that later). It's an extremely complex world that needs to be thoroughly explained in order to deeply understand how it works, and what's everyone's role in it. This is the film's main problem: it struggles to juggle all of its different storylines and distinct characters. Even with 163min of runtime, it's impossible to squeeze in all of the necessary information.

So, as expected, Snyder and his team of screenwriters had to simplify, shorten, or even wholly dismiss some story elements that would only stretch the runtime to an unfathomable length. Some of the adaptations work brilliantly, but some fail to give a character its importance or offer no interest to a subplot. However, it's still easy to understand everything, and how the ending is going to unravel, which leads me to my second issue with the movie: its final act's heavy exposition.

Like I wrote above, there is a lot of information to deliver. What Snyder did very well was to tell most of it through flashbacks or captivating conversations, but in the final act, where everything was self-explanatory and in no need of more exposition, there is an excess of redundant dialogue that doesn't really add anything relevant. What the characters are saying is significant, yes, but we, as the audience, already know all of that way before the film's climax. It's ironic how they make a joke about villains telling their masterplan to the hero and how this villain isn't dumb enough to do it, but then proceed to carefully explain everything (that we know already) through exposition.

Sincerely, these are the major problems that I have with the movie. However, I love so much about everything else. From the appropriated and fun soundtracks to the beautiful production design, Zack Snyder and his crew really do a fantastic work technically. Snyder's style captures Watchmen's world perfectly. It's one of those films that carry a ""feel"" due to its stylish cinematography. I love how little CGI is actually applied (I'm obviously ignoring the big blue guy), and the abundance of practical effects and real sets that are used. The action sequences look spectacular, way better than a lot of blockbusters nowadays (10 years later!).

Despite the terrific technical achievements, my main compliment is actually connected to my number one problem. Even though the storylines are incredibly hard to balance, characters like Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) have extraordinarily captivating and entertaining stories. There might be a few missteps here and there, but Snyder made ONE movie from a material that's worth a whole TV show or at least two films. And he delivered a GOOD one! Probably a better job than 80% of the directors working today could ever achieve. Finally, the social commentary is still quite relevant for this new generation, and if the so-called ""source-material-purists"" didn't exist, this movie would be a lot more appreciated.

All in all, Watchmen is as good as it could be, having in mind it's just one film with already a long runtime. Its narrative was always going to be extremely difficult to tell in a solid yet compelling manner, and Zack Snyder does struggle with balancing all of the storylines and its characters. However, he and his phenomenal team still delivered a good flick. Technically sublime, with a distinct style, brilliant production design, and gorgeous cinematography. Characters like Rorschach and Nite Owl have amazing moments, filled with excellent action sequences, but also with emotionally powerful scenes. If it could be better? Maybe. If it could be split into two or three movies. As it stands, as one and only film, it's really impressive even with its flaws.

13183,"As humans, we are drawn to what inspires us, interests us, and tickles our fancy. Human opinion can be a fickle thing, especially when it comes to film, books, and music, due to this the message that is interwoven through these mediums are missed by all of us simply because we won't take the time to watch, read or listen to what is being said to us.

The message throughout Watchman and Tales of The Black Freighter in film and more importantly in graphic novel form is that we as humans try so hard to make the world a better place, but being pushed so far while trying to rid the world of evil we become the very thing we're fighting against, sometimes this a fact we do not see, or we do when it's too late. When Alan Moore wrote the story for the graphic novel, he did so at the height of this planet's greatest threat of nuclear annihilation; The Cold War, The U.S. and Russia at a stalemate over nuclear arms, and Russia's invasion of Afghanistan, had meant that at any moment millions of people on this planet could have met a brutal end.

As far as the story goes, this is a concept that has been warped, and manipulated into a alternate universe where in 1985 Richard Nixon has changed the constitution of the USA and made it allowable for him to serve more than 2 terms of Presidency, it's also a universe where in the times after WWII ordinary citizens decided that crime and corruption throughout America, and especially New York had gotten to levels beyond the control of authorities that they would suit up as masked vigilantes, and fight crime head on. By 1985 masked heroes are outlawed, and former ""heroes"" were forced to reveal themselves, or stay hidden, but give up their lifestyle.

The story of the most part is told through the eyes of one character Rorschach (Haley) as he investigates the murder of a fellow vigilante, The Comedian (Morgan). Rorschach is the only vigilante who has not given up the lifestyle, and is wanted by the F.B.I. Rorschach tries to re-engage the remaining ""heroes"" to help him find the murderer, and get to the heart of why he was murdered. The other ""heroes"" are Night Owl II (Wilson); an aging recluse who inherited a fortune from his father and used it to engage in vigilante activities, Silk Spectre II (Ackerman); daughter of an original Minutewoman (Cugino), Ozymandias (Goode), a self made millionaire who has modeled himself and his life on Alexander the Great, and Dr. Manhattan (Crudup), the only real superhero due an accident in a atomic chamber in a lab when he was a physicist.

The film follows pretty closely the themes and tone of the book, much more than any comic related movie before it, thanks mostly to the dedication of director Zack Snyder. The look and feel of the film to date it in 1985 was very well handled, and can certainly be called a period piece due to the level of exact detail through-out. Performances are in general pretty well done, and reflect the emotions of the characters in the book, as this is the Ultimate Cut, the extended scenes, plus the interwoven story of the comic book within a comic book; ""Tales of The Black Freighter"" make for a film that is worthy of its 215 minute length. Having said that they leave well and truly enough of the story in the theatrical cut where the message still shines through.

The credits for this film are the best I have ever seen, using the Bob Dylan song ""The Times They Are A-Changing"", and features snapshots of the highs and lows of the Minutemen and Watchmen from the 1940's through to the 1980's against the backdrop of important cultural and political icons and events.

This movie is easily one of my favourites of the modern age of film, because of the well delivered message, and the uncompromised approach to bring the graphic novel to life.",10.0

_Watchmen_ polarised audiences when it arrived in theatres in 2009. Coming not long after Marvel's _Iron Man_ many were expecting a fun action oriented super hero movie. _Watchmen_ however, is not that kind of movie. Just like the source material it comes from, this is a dark and brooding film that deals with some complicated questions.

Here is the official description:

_In a gritty and alternate 1985 the glory days of costumed vigilantes have been brought to a close by a government crackdown, but after one of the masked veterans is brutally murdered, an investigation into the killer is initiated. The reunited heroes set out to prevent their own destruction, but in doing so uncover a sinister plot that puts all of humanity in grave danger._

Starting off with a fantastic montage that, with barely a word, fills you in on the alternate history of the movie, and the timeline of things leading up to the start of the main story, Watchmen does a great job of building this world you are about to inhabit for two hours and 45 minutes. The characters are strong, and develop logically over the course of the film, and you can really feel their sense of despair or feeling of not belonging. I think of all the comic book movies I've seen, this one captures best those feelings the characters have of being lonely outsiders. Rorschach's commitment to the truth in the movie leads to a brilliant defining moment was where it all just bursts out from him. It was very well done. He, as a character, is so good that I think he deserves his own movie in the same noir-ish style.

The length and style of this will turn a lot of people off, it is much more of a character piece than a big explosive action extravaganza. In my opinion, it's one of the better comic book movies out there.

Top all that off with a fantastic sound track of 1980s music and this is a pretty good package. If you like bright lights and shiny tights, this is not the comic book movie for you. If however you like a super hero movie with some depth and that deals with some philosophical questions this will give you a lot more to chew over than some other DC adaptations.",8.0
13183,"_**The ""Apocalypse Now"" of superhero films**_

Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, 2009's ""Watchmen"" takes place in an alternative 1985 where Nixon is serving his fifth term and costumed vigilantism is illegal. A former masked crimefighter named The Comedian is murdered, prompting his previous teammates to investigate the crime. Things get complicated as the backstories of most of the Watchmen are revealed and worldwide nuclear war looms.

For some reason I was never interested in the Watchmen and therefore never read the graphic novel, even though I had the opportunity. Why? The fact that it took place in an alternative reality turned me off, as did the peculiarities of the team members which, I later discovered, Moore intended as satire. That said, this is mind-blowing. ""Watchmen"" is an adult-oriented superhero flick with a convoluted plot, strong characters and total originality. The latter two score high marks with me any day.

Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) stands out with his gravelly voice and right-wing ideology, although he's not very likable. He's impressive yet, at the same time, kind of pathetic. The character was based on Steve Ditko's The Question.

The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) exudes great charisma and is reminiscent of The Punisher, if he were a jokester. Unfortunately, The Comedian's arrogant & hotheaded and has a weakness towards the ladies, not to mention cold-blooded murder.

Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) is another strong character, obviously based on Batman or Blue Beetle. Unlike the previous two he's very likable. I always thought his costume looked really lame in the graphic novel but, as depicted in the film, it kicks axx.

Dr. Manhattan (Greg Plitt), named for the Manhattan Project and based on Captain Atom with a dash of Mr. Fantastic, is an almost God-like being who can do pretty much anything. He's so detached from the human experience that he walks around totally nude and has no time for his woman, Silk Spectre II. He'd rather hang out on Mars -- literally!

Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) stands out due to her sexy costume more than anything else, not to mention Akerman's drop-dead-gorgeous looks. The character was based on Phantom Lady and Black Canary. Silk can't handle Dr. Manhattan's increasing aloofness and consequently diverts to Night Owl for human warmth.

Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino) is Silk Spectre II's mother and has a pretty significant part. Like her daughter, she's hot, albeit in a whole different way.

Ozzyosbourne, whoops, I mean Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the least developed character and loosely based on Charlton Comic's Thunderbolt. He's ultra-smart, ultra-quick and kinda foppish.

Another highlight is the hypnotic score by Tyler Bates mixed with a quality soundtrack (e.g. ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""All Along the Watchtower,"" etc.)

BOTTOM LINE: The film is long, dark, mature, dialogue-driven and convoluted, but the strong characters and originality win the day. No moronic ""blockbuster"" trash here. Not to mention Silk Spectre II and her mother are extremely easy on the eyes. As far as superhero flicks go, there's really nothing else like ""Watchmen."" It's even more atypical than the X-Men and easily one of my favorite superhero flicks, maybe even THE favorite. ""Watchmen"" is like the ""Apocalypse Now"" of superhero films!

RUNTIME: Theatrical Cut: 162 minutes; Director's Cut: 186 minutes; The Ultimate Cut: 215 minutes

COMPARING CUTS: I own both the theatrical cut and Director's Cut. Although the theatrical version is just fine, the DC is worthwhile for extended dialogue to existing scenes in the theatrical cut; the biggest addition is an attack on Night Owl's Mentor, Hollis Mason, at the hands of a thug gang and Night Owl's subsequent brutal revenge at a bar. Despite the convoluted plot, I had no problem following the story in the theatrical cut, even though I've never read the graphic novel. The filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version. So don't think you'll need to purchase the DC to understand the story; it's not necessary. My recommendation is to check out the theatrical version first and only purchase the DC if the theatrical cut left you wanting even more, which is what it did for me. Even so, I PREFER the theatrical cut; it's leaner and just all-around better.

13184,"I was taught four rules...

The Pang Brothers remake their 2000 Asian film for the American audience with mixed results. Starring Nic Cage, film follows Cage's hit-man to Bangkok where he is to complete a number of hits. He tells us via narration that he has a set of rules that he follows so as to survive in the ""business"". He then promptly breaks his own codes and his life comes under threat.

That's pretty much it as regards plotting. The Pang's bring much visual style to the picture, and show themselves to be adept at action sequences, but it all feels so familiar. Action movies are rarely going to bring new stuff to the table, they often, as is the case here, are kinetic popcorn pictures missing some emotional depth to marry up with the carnage. Thus this is not a film to be sought out by any action junkies looking for something new to add to their collections. As it happens Cage is fine and broody, managing to blend hard ass machismo with vulnerable traits. He, and the filmic style make it above average, even if ultimately it's instantly forgettable afterwards. 6/10",6.0
13185,"The Yoof of today eh!

 

Britain’s answer to Larry Clark’s Kids, Kidulthood works hard for realism and shock value but falls somewhere in between. Story focuses on a group of London youngsters who have been given the day off school when one of their classmates commits suicide after being bullied. The various groups of friends spin off to do their own thing, which invariably involves drugs, violence, casual sex, teenage pregnancy angst, revenge and lots of cussing in street speak. All this is crammed into a 24 hour period, suggesting that the yoof of today never live a dull moment when not at school.

 

Writer Noel Clarke (who also stars) and director Menhaj Huda clearly want to keep things raw and authentic, but it eventually comes off as wholly unbelievable. In fact it at times feels like it’s a bunch of mates making a film and living out some fantasies where they get to be wicked for a day. There’s some messages in the mix trying to break out of the hysteria, to be a wake-up call to parents and elders as to what is happening under our noses, but ultimately sensationalism wins the day.

It’s a film strung together by a number of instances, characterisation and reasoning is given short shrift, the makers over egging the pudding in their unrelenting mission to shock. Some scenes are undeniably attention grabbing, while the soundtrack pulses away with verve and Brian Tufano’s cinematography is right on the money, but come the preachy finale you may feel you really haven’t learned anything new about the unruly and unfeeling kids of today. 6/10",6.0
13186,"_**One of the goriest films ever made**_

A Survivor-like reality show meets in the backwoods of West Virginia where the contestants & crew find themselves assaulted by a family of mutant yokels. Henry Rollins plays the Drill Instructor-like host of the show.

“Wrong Turn 2: Dead End” (2007) is the first of many sequels in the franchise about cannibalistic hillbillies in Appalachia. The reason ""Deliverance"" (1972) is so iconic and unsettling is because the story actually COULD happen. The first “Wrong Turn” film from 2003 started out this way but became increasingly unbelievable as the story progressed. As such, it was entertaining and compelling but not genuinely scary. 

This one adds some overt camp and goofiness while increasing the gore factor. It may well be the goriest film ever made at the time of its release. And it is entertaining to a point, despite the disgusting elements (not just gore, but sleaze as well), yet it’s not truly chilling because it’s so over-the-top it’s cartoonish.  

Still, Rollins does well as the gung-ho host and a few of the protagonists emerge as likable people worthy of surviving. Unfortunately, the most agreeable character is one of the first to buy the farm. I’m of course not taking about the annoying Kimberly Caldwell in the opening, although what happens to her is amusing in a “shocking” black humor kind of way.

Petite Aleksa Palladino (Mara) stands out on the feminine front. Crystal Lowe (Elena) is alluring but her character is a loathsome skank. Erica Leerhsen (Nina), who was a highlight as the Wiccan lass in ""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2"" (2000), still looks good, but has unfortunately lost weight and looks stick-like.

The mutant hicks are well done, but most of them look like Klingons from Star Trek from back in the day, just uglier.

While “Wrong Turn 2” has some entertainment value, it’s so excessive in its attempt to be revolting & amusing it loses impact. Less is more.

13187,"Another one of those classic old children’s Christmas shows I first watched  who knows when, but probably when it first came out, and have seen a couple dozen more times since then.

When dealing with a show I loved as a kid, I refuse to try to separate the adult viewer and rate it more harshly. The memory and the childish feelings I had for it are wrapped up in its value for me. For example, I am an atheist, so the nativity story doesn’t carry a religious message for me, but I can appreciate its function in the story, and I read a lot of other fictional mythical origin stories without being cynical.

It is funny that our minds connect the jazz theme with Christmas, when it is, well, jazz. Also an oddity that Bill Melendez was the producer, director and voice (such as it was) for Snoopy. They used children for a lot of the voices, rather than adults simulating child voices.

I've previously only watched the Disney animated film and the 2019 television miniseries with Guy Pearce. I also like both of those, they each have things that are inferior and superior to this 1951 film.

Alastair Sim is the best Ebenezer Scrooge of the three, I loved watching him from start-to-finish. Sim's facial expressions are terrific throughout, while his happiness later on is infectious. A top performance!

None of the others massively standout, unlike the aforementioned productions, but George Cole (young Scrooge) is pleasant, as are those who play the ghosts. Other positives include the score, the tension building and the arc of the lead character - given the fact that they make him horrid at the beginning.

The special effects haven't aged well, but that's to be very much expected almost seventy years on - in fairness, they look pretty good for '51. Elsewhere, I found that some of the camera shots are held for too long, while I also wanted more reactions of Sim when he was seeing the past/present/future - sometimes they chose to stick on the 'event', rather than showing Sim.

Those aren't major criticisms at all, just small ones. All in all, <em>'Scrooge'</em> is a very good film - one well worth a view!",8.0
13188,"I read a review by a critic which stated this is the best adaptation of the oh so familiar story of Charles Dickens’ Scrooge. Not because of advanced production value or cutting edge special effects. In fact, this movie is definitely low tech, being from 1952 as it is.

But now I agree with that assessment. There are three elements that in my mind elevate this production to the top of the pile.   The first is the setting and the mood of the film. This felt like Dickensian London to me, the rough streets and dense atmosphere through the fog and just the look of the people.

The story was also handled with a deft touch. It has been a long time since I have read the novella by Dickens, but this story felt closer to the original. I like the details they added sometimes when Scrooge was with the Christmas ghosts. For one example, when it showed the people selling Scrooge’s belongings, they spoke at some little length, about their lives and about Scrooge. And then later that scene illustrates how much Scrooge has altered, for he interacts with the woman he saw selling his curtains and gives her a raise.

Finally there is Alastair Sims as Scrooge. He gives a multi-layered performance I appreciated more and more as the story went on. He convinced me during his second ghost that he might want to change but probably wouldn’t. He wasn’t there yet and needed the third ghost to get him over the top. His final conversion felt convincing to me, the little and big laughs of his were evidence of a man who knew he had been spared a final tragic chapter in his and others’ lives.",10.0
13188,"Alastair Sim is in his element here as the curmudgeonly miser who routinely spends his Christmas alone counting his fortune. Luckily for him, ""Scrooge"" receives a visit from his late but not so lamented partner ""Marley"" (Michael Hordern) who warns him that he is to receive three visitors this cold and snowy Christmas morning. These ghosts are to show him was has happened, is happening and might well happen if he doesn't mend his venal and selfish ways. Meantime, in a hovel nearby his clerk ""Bob"" (Mervyn Johns) is celebrating with his wife and five children - including the enthusiastic but poorly ""Tim"" (Glen Dearman). As the dawn approaches, perhaps ""Scrooge"" can find salvation from the home truths being presented to him? This version tells us more of the establishment of the character, aided by a joyous contribution from Jack Warner as his mentor ""Jorkin"" and also allows the supporters more of a role. Kathleen Harrison and Miles Malleson provide some light relief as ""Scrooge"" really does come to realise the contempt and disdain in which he's held by just about everyone - rich or poor. It's Sim, though, who has the character almost perfectly set here. He positively exudes the humbuggery of the role, his facial expressions convey menace, horror, joy and mischief enjoyably and by the conclusion you really do sense that he enjoyed the part as much as I did. The production captures both the emotional and physical frostiness and brutality of the scenario and it really is a reminder of no man being an island - or at least being happy as one. I wouldn't say Sim was better at the role than Sir Seymour Hicks, but he's certainly just as good.",8.0

Wonderful Adaptation.

The 1984 TV version of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol is a joyous thing. Fronted by George C. Scott as the infamous Ebenezer Scrooge, Clive Donner’s movie pays great respects to the source material and garners a multi stranded piece of brilliance out of Scott. The characters of course remain the same, but headed by Scrooge having a complex and painful background and a persona of confused emotions, there’s meaty substance holding the movie up high. Donner and writer Roger Hirson retain the black heart of the source story, with the horror elements suitably effective to bother the children, while the Victorian atmosphere always feels – crucially – authentic.

What are we dealing with here?: A Christmas Carol is an American dramatic fantasy film from director Clive Donner and writer Roger O. Hirson. This is one of many film adaptations of this classic Charles Dickens novella from 1843. It stars George C. Scott, Frank Finlay, David Warner, and Susannah York. It was first released in the United Kingdom on October 9th, 1984. It hit American television waves a few months later, airing on CBS on December 17th, 1984. 

What’s it about?: Ebenezer Scrooge is an old miser that doesn't care for Christmas or the holiday spirit. So one fateful Christmas Eve he's visited by three spirits that attempt to show him the error of his ways. The Ghost of Christmas past the Ghost of Christmas present and the Ghost of Christmas’ yet to come. 

Rotten Analysis: This is considered by many to be the definitive edition of A Christmas Carol, and I can really see why. This is such a delightful and faithful take on the story that tackles themes of humanity, compassion, and social equality. It also speaks to the frustration that workers may be feeling, especially during rough times. I remember watching this as a child and being absolutely terrified. The tone, the setting—it's all so creepy. The Jacob Marley scene is especially terrifying, with his chains and head wrapping. While all the performances are excellent, Frank Finlay's portrayal of Jacob Marley is the stuff of nightmares.

The Ghost of Christmas Present, played by Edward Woodward, is my favorite interpretation of the spirit. He's hot and cold, flexing his acting muscles across the emotional spectrum. He also has some terrifying moments, like when he reveals the two emaciated children hidden under his cloak. It's a truly haunting image. And if that wasn't frightening enough, the Ghost of Christmas Future is shrouded in macabre mystery. His very silence evokes a profound sense of dread. Watch this one with the lights on, folks! I've always liked the touches of terror that creep into this story. Every adaptation seems to find creative ways to incorporate them.

But it's obvious that the true heavyweight actors here are George C. Scott and David Warner. Both are so damn good in their roles. I can't think of anyone who would have been better suited to play Ebenezer Scrooge. He's so gruff and rough around the edges. I don't think that anyone can deliver a ""humbug"" as convincingly as he can. A perfect angry curmudgeon. And Warner plays the most identifiable and real version of Bob Cratchit I've seen. Not just his dialogue, but his facial expressions and everything that Warner brings to the table is top quality. The young Anthony Walters plays Tiny Tim and is appropriately sympathetic.

The dialogue is standard from the traditional text, but Hirson takes the opportunity to carve his own niche here. And it's perfect. The liberties taken with the original story blend seamlessly. This is the best live-action and true-to-form adaptation of Charles Dickens' tale, mostly due to the performances. But beyond that, it's a film that just seems to get everything right. The tone, setting, characters, and events are all very authentic. The set dressing is award-worthy. The art direction is amazing. Do yourself a favor and throw this one on during this holiday season. It may seem stuffy at first, but it's actually pretty fun to get through. A fine film for a Christmas tradition. RottenPop gives this classic holiday tale four stars.

13190,"Dead Space Downfall reduces its space horror aesthetic to a chunk of unpolished planetary rock. Back when Electronic Arts released the original ‘Dead Space’, I happened to download and install the demo. A thirty minute segment that highlighted the darkened horror and survivalist gameplay mechanics. That, well, was enough for me. Far too frightening and involving for me. So when I heard an animated prequel was released, my intrigue once again spiked and perhaps would illicit a fresh wave of adoration for the video game franchise. Sadly, it did the opposite, deterring me away from the games forever. A planetary flight crew discover an extraterrestrial monolithic marker that rapidly turn members into homicidal nightmarish creatures, meaning the remaining individuals must fight to survive.

Thus begins the enduring battle against the animalistic Necromorphs. Yet beneath the blood covering the crevices of the Ishimura and the mundane brutality of limbs being severed, is an undercooked plot circling around faith. Followers of the Church of Unitology demanding to see the newly acquired holy relic, devotees oblivious to the chaotic harm that it has caused. Religious persecution, if you will.

However the writers chose to subdue this interesting strand and instead incorporated a thirty minute montage of crew members being savaged by Necromorphs through some of the most bland, stilted and downright dreadful animation available. Over-textured blurry 3D CGI monstrosities that forced me to question if I had my spectacles on or not, never complementing the basic 2D character designs. The original ‘Scooby Doo’ series looked better than this, a cartoon created decades ago! The characters themselves had no personality injected into them and instead emanated hard talking shells. “Fight...or die!”. “I’m not a hero, just a man!”. The voice acting was nearly as tedious as a Bible reading powered by the emotionless tones of Tommy Wiseau. The blood, whilst insurmountable in terms of quantity, was too excessive and tame to be effective.

If it wasn’t for the overburden of paranoia, mass hysteria and delusional grandeur, which can be contributing factors for deep space travel, this animated prequel would have nothing going for it.

Things is - where did all the stones all go? It's quite an interesting premiss not unlike ""11 Harrowhouse"" (1974) but the pace is really quite slow and the pairing of Moore and Caine doesn't really catch fire. It does take a bit of a swipe at the venal, corporate incompetence, sexism and patronage and shines a light on crooked industrial and insurance arrangements that smack very much of emperor's new clothes, but it's just a bit under-written and lacklustre conclusion of this film rather sums it all up.

13207,"'Friday the 13th' turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments when it comes to horror classics remakes. After watching the trailers, I got the wrong idea that this film was going to be more serious. The previews gave me the false impression that this remake was going to go deeper into Jason's background story or maybe even offer extremely gory murders, when in reality, it is exactly the opposite. I'm not one of those horror lovers who want to know everything related to the villains, their origins and such, but in this case, it would have been acceptable to throw in some flashbacks regarding Jason Voorhees' past. Unfortunately, this remake wastes all the opportunities to make this interesting and instead, it offers an exaggerated and ineffective amount of comedy situations that are badly placed and ruin the possibility of creating a genuine horror feeling. Comedy situations in slasher films are no surprise, but in this remake, the attempted comedy is badly placed and seems like it was forced by the producers to make the film more marketable. I will give an example: after a really tense and dramatic persecution, the film cuts to a scene involving a horny stereotyped hillbilly lusting over a mannequin, while Jason silently walking up to him from behind, with the obvious intention of slashing him. How can they mix cheap humor and tension in one scene? The results obviously cannot be good. It was a murder scene, but instead of causing uneasiness, tension or shock, everyone at the movie theater was laughing at the guy talking about how he lost his virginity to a mannequin. The worst part is that the so-called humor is extremely 15-years-ago and even back then, it wouldn't have been funny.

The gore is very unsatisfying also. Nowadays, slasher films usually offer creative and really brutal murders and even if the plot is not so good, you can always at least settle for that. When I found out that Marcus Nispel was directing this, I thought it was good news, because he directed ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" remake, which is a fine example of a movie that may not be as good as the original, but at least it offers something more serious, gory and overall fulfilling. Naturally, since Marcus Nispel also directed 'Friday the 13th' remake, I expected something in the same vein as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake. Sadly, that was a very inaccurate assumption. In this film, the gore is completely unsatisfactory and in some cases, the murders are even funny. The entire movie theater burst into a maniacal laughter during some of the murders and I must say that in those cases, I had to agree with them.

Another thing that bothered me about this film, is the fact that they could have showed a little bit more about the character of Mrs. Voorhees. Unfortunately, she only appears during the first seconds of the film and they cut her scenes with the opening credits, which is a disgrace. The confrontation between Mrs. Voorhees and the counselor girl is perhaps one of the finest points of the entire 'Friday the 13th' series, and it should have been remade in an equally tense way. Cutting the scene with the opening credits is, in my opinion, a self-sabotage. I think it's safe to say that many fans of the original film were eager to learn some more about Jason's beloved mother and see her more time on the screen. But no... apparently, they didn't even take advantage of that opportunity to make this movie more interesting. True, we see a little bit about Jason's environment, since the characters get to take a tour inside his house and it was a good idea to show his bedroom and evidence the fact that once upon a time, the killing machine was an innocent boy with a normal life. However, that doesn't make up for the lack of space that Mrs. Voorhees had on the story.

'Friday the 13th' turned out to be a teen comedy with lousy humor and some badly placed murders from the beginning until the end. Watch it if you're curious, but unless you're a silly teenager who thinks everything is funny, don't expect anything even remotely good, because you'll be devastated.",4.0
13207,"***Scarier and with a more dangerous Jason, but not as fun***

I became a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series after seeing ""Part V: A New Beginning"" (1985) on TV in the late 90s and have subsequently digested all of the films in the series. This '09 reboot takes elements of the first four films, drops all campy elements seen in Part III (and V, VI, IX & X) and provides better scares with a more dangerous Jason, who runs, shoots arrows, uses traps and schemes. In the original series Jason was comparable to an unstoppable zombie-like force, particularly as the series progressed where Jason became more & more infernal and monstrous. Here he's more human, which makes sense since it's early in the timeline and Jason hasn't yet morphed into the hellish zombie he became in later segments.

The appeal of the series for is not the gore or kills but rather the plot of a group of youths gathering in the wilderness; the inclusion of a psycho killer on the loose adds a necessary element of threat & suspense, and Jason's a quality nemesis/monster. Simply put, ""Friday the 13th"" is an entertaining series with creepy elements, but I never found the flicks all that scary, not even the first two films, which are the most serious in tone, along with IV, VII, VIII and XI. Of course there are jump-scares galore, but that's not what I'm talking about. With the third installment, campiness was added, which made several of the installments even less scary. The good thing about this '09 reboot is that it throws out the campy aspects and opts for a more serious approach. In addition, it has a couple of sequences that produce actual frights, something I never experienced with the rest of the series, as well as scenes with genuine suspense, like when Jason chases the three protagonists through the tunnels, etc.

Speaking of the three protagonists, the cast is filled with youthful no-names, but the three main protagonists, a brother & sister and a brunette who takes a liking to the brother, are good and likable. It's always nice to have some people you can root for. Really, there are only two characters who are unlikable, a creepy redneck hick (and his ""hot"" mannequin, lol) and the arrogant alpha-male whose father owns the vacation house.

I found one aspect of the film highly unusual and unique. I'm referring to the 24-minute prologue before the opening credits. This has to be one of the longest prologues in film history. I have to give credit to the filmmakers for being creative and trying something different.

This reboot also just plain LOOKS better than all those older films; I'm referring mostly to the creepy woods at night. This is to be expected, of course, with the advancements in filming technology since 1980, not to mention the bigger budget.

The series is known for its excellent assortment of women in every entry, but this one's not quite as good as most of the films in the franchise. There's the excellent Amanda (America Olivo) in the first act and also Whitney (Amanda Righetti) and Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) as the two female protagonists. They're solid, but not in the same league as Pam in Part V, Agent Marcus in Part IX and Heather in Part XI (FvJ). I suppose it's all a matter of taste though. 

The film was shot in the heart of Texas, mainly in regions relatively near Austin.

FINAL WORD: My biggest criteria for judging the worth of a film is whether or not it pulls me in and makes me forget about the passing of time. This '09 reboot succeeds in this respect. Although nothing can replace the initial 1980 film and its immediate sequel, this reboot should be given credit for generating a few genuine scares, which I rarely if ever experienced with the rest of the series; not to mention providing a worthy trio of protagonists, as well as scenes with genuine momentum. 

Other than these factors, the reboot is just more of the same, but it's at least as good as the better sequels, although it's not as fun as several of them because it shoots for serious horror. This is good, but the first half is more effective than the second. And it fails to approach the greatness of the '09 remake of ""The Last House on the Left,"" a veritable masterpiece that transcends the usual one-dimensional nature of most slasher flicks, not that I would expect (or necessarily want) that for ""Friday the 13th."" 

I have the ""Killer Cut"" that runs 105 minutes, while the theatrical version runs 97 minutes. Needless to say, this is a heavy R-rated picture.

GRADE: B",7.0
13207,"**The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2009.**

_Friday the 13th_, originally released in 1980 began one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Now, 31 years later, the newest incarnation of _Friday the 13th_ has just been released on Special Edition DVD. It seems unlikely that the director of the first film Sean S. Cunningham (who is also the producer of the 2009 version) could ever have seen just where the monster he had helped to create would go. So now, with the series being given one of those oh-so-popular of late ""reboots"", it's important to take a look at what Jason Voorhees has been up to, what has changed, and just as importantly, what hasn't.

The film loosely follows the progression of the first four _Friday the 13th_ films, the opening credit sequence has mother dearest Pamela Voorhees on June 13, 1980 confronting one of the Camp Crystal Lake counsellors , she is promptly decapitated with a machete, as per the original story. This is a powerful intro to the rest of the movie, as a reboot, you have to show Mrs. Voorhees at some point in time, but it can't take up too many of those valuable 90 minutes. At this point the film begins to deviate from the original, we get some of Harry Manfredini's musical score (Ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma) but this time round Jason is very much alive, sees his mother beheaded and picks up his iconic machete and some very bad habits from here on in. After the credits there is a new bunch of kids, looking to score some pot, have a little pre-marital sex, get wasted, go places they're not allowed, and just generally set themselves up to die. But something is missing... that would be... Oh yes, the cast! Only a single member of the ""media-hyped"" actors portrays a character in this group, so we already know that these guys are going nowhere. Only after their demise are we given the ""_FRIDAY THE 13TH_"" movie title, and the film begins. Unfortunately, by the time this happens, we have already been through a good set of characters, and it feels like watching a sequel after you're 23 minutes in.

The new group of rowdy teenagers have much the same plans in store as the last, but they are much less believable characters when compared to the ones we had just minutes ago. They are somewhat saved by the performances of Travis Van Winkle (from _Accepted_) as Trent, the ""rich asshole"" of the movie, and Aaron Yoo as Chewie, the lovable little stoner. Jared Padalecki's character Clay (a reboot of Rob from _Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter_) is wholly out of place, maybe it's his _Supernatural_ fame or maybe it's his deliberate intention to not have a good time. Either way the protagonist of the entire film really doesn't seem like he belongs in the movie at all. Sort of a down point when you think about it.

While the film didn't seem to have plot holes per se, it very much seems as though they tried to fit the creation of the film in before it was due to be released on Friday, February 13th. Now don't get me wrong, I love novelty and a good theatrical gimmick as much as anyone can, but know what I care about even more? The end product (especially when it comes to _Friday the 13th_)! The time could have been much better spent on filling in all the little bits where the movie just seemed to be missing something. You're not quite sure what it is, but that's their job to figure out.

The hype over the film's sexual content seems to have been grossly over-exaggerated. Supposedly Michael Bay walked out of the first screening due to the sex scenes. After having watched the film, I find this very difficult to believe. Although the sex does seem to have been thrown in for the Hell of it (isn't it always), there really isn't all that much. But, after all of the problems the film goes through, they get the most important thing right, Jason. With culturally recognised hockey mask and machete in tow, Mr. Voorhees does his thing, and he does it well. Whilst this particular incarnation of Jason is wholly more believable than any of the others, Derek Mears makes it work, he's not a supernatural boogieman-esque killing machine, he's a hunter, he's a natural, he's almost the anti-hero. Upon first hearing that Kane Hodder was yet again not to be playing the role of Jason Voorhees, I think a little part of me died inside. But I submit, Derek Mears has given the best representation of Jason I think we've ever seen.

The 2009 reboot of _Friday the 13th_ is the type of movie that you can watch, and when it's finished, want to go right back to the beginning and watch it all over again, you're just not sure why...

13210,"I think sometimes it is important to remember that even 10 years after the war was over, there was still an appetite - even a neccessity - for war stories that celebrated (ok, and frequently embellished) the successes of the many ordinary folk who fought in the war. This film is one such story. Based on real events and characters it is nonetheless a drama. It does manipulate the facts a little; though the use of bouncing bombs - innovatively designed from scratch - well, with a little help from Napoleon - by Barnes Wallis (Michael Redgrave) to destroy three German dams on the Ruhr by a squadron led by Wing Commander Guy Gibson (Richard Todd) is fact. The film gradually demonstrates the frustrations as these devices are tested, of the dedication of those charged with delivering them and, of course, of the peril faced by the crews - many of whom were destined never to return. I saw this recently on television and the announcer apologised in advance for the ""racist language"" which i assumed referred to Gibson's dog. Strange it didn't see fit to apologise for the portrayal of indiscriminate death inflicted by both sides on the other. An odd, modern day irony only made possible by the exploits of the sorts of people and achievements this film sets out to commemorate.",7.0

Smart little horror this, what it lacks in story originality it more than makes up for elsewhere.

Young lovers Seth (Paulo Costanzo) and Polly (Jill Wagner) find their attempts at a romantic camping trip usurped by their inadequacies in the great outdoors. But this soon becomes the very least of their problems, because they are car-jacked by escaped convict Dennis Farell (Shea Whigham) and his drug addict girlfriend Lacey Belisle (Rachel Kerbs). When they run over what they think is an animal of some sort, it signals the start of a terrifying ordeal that will see the group backed into the interior of a gas station and forced to fight for their lives.

What follows is a solid hour of suspense, terror, horrifying scenes and rich character dynamics. It’s a siege situation with the enemy some sort of porcupine – vegetable – human hybrid, and it’s relentless and clever. Director Toby Wilkins doesn’t once let the picture sag or suffer from filler, all scenes and character interactions are integral to the plotting. Mercifully free of characters doing the dumb things that are so inherent in this splinter (hrr hrr hrr) of horror, Wilkins’ film is consistently effective in what it wants to achieve. 

The effects are kept to a minimum and the only real complaint is that for every attack by the creature we are subjected to shakycam. If this is to hide the effects work we don’t know? And it’s always great to have a horror assailant be used sparingly on a visual level, but the shakycam becomes annoying and feels like a bit of a cheat in the final quarter. The small cast offer up some sterling performances, with Whigham standing out as the hateful villain, while Nelson Cragg’s photography strips the colours down to primal indie level and the film is better for it.

13221,"In 1852, Sami reindeer herders in the Arctic region of Norway were fed up with the Norwegian liquor industry exploiting their tendency to alcoholism, local government officials seizing parts of their herds, and a corrupt state church ignoring it all. They rioted, beating the local priest and killing a merchant and government official. The two men considered ringleaders, Aslak Haetta and Mons Somby, were tried and executed. This incidence is little-known in most of Europe, but in the history of the Sami people it is one of the few tales of resistence to pressure from their southern neighbors and has gained a sort of epic status. Nils Gaups' 2008 film <i>The Kautokeino Rebellion</i> depicts this event. The main character of the film is Ellen Aslaksdatter Skum, who with her husband Mathis Haetta, was sentenced to long imprisonment. Ellen is played by Anni-Kristiina Juuso, a Sami actress best known for her role in Aleksandr Rogozhkin's 2001 film <i>The Cuckoo</i>. The film is multilingual, with the Sami speaking their own language, Swedish used as a lingua franca, and Norwegian heard from a few outsiders. Mid-19th century Norway is depicted in absorbing detail, and watching the film I felt to some degree that I was sharing the challenges of the characters in the frozen north.

The film takes a few liberties with history (the whipping of the priest isn't portrayed, and the rioters are stopped by what seem to be Norwegians instead of their own other Sami neighbors. Still, it's generally factual and really inspires the viewer to go out and learn more about the event. What I really admire about the film is that it doesn't try to portray the murderers as bold defenders of national consciousness: their uprising was something of an act of blind rage and they were betraying their own Christian ideals. Other depictions of the riots, such as Launis' godawful opera ""Aslak Hetta"", give in to hyperbolic National Romantic feelings, but Gaups' film keeps it on the level.",6.0

I admittedly do have a difficult time separating film and real life, to me films are just fictional things but I get they can/do have real world implications.

Strictly as a film, it is entertaining. Clint Eastwood is remarkably good at being a super racist and super grumpy old man, who literally hates every single person he encounters across the opening portion of the film. His character's lines in this are nuts and his delivery with them is incredible - the look of utter disgust on Walt Kowalski's face when someone pisses him off in a new way is just amusing to watch. If not for his on point delivery, it wouldn't have worked.

Eastwood is the only actor in this worth talking about on a grander level, though I could've done without his ropey singing at the end, but I did enjoy the showings of the earlier mentioned Vang, Ahney Her and John Carroll Lynch - not that the latter does much, I just like the guy as an actor... all stems from <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">The Walking Dead</a>'</em>, he's in literally one episode back in 2015 and yet I always remember his character.

Clint Eastwood and Bee Vang put in great performances. Walt, played by Clint Eastwood, is a tough character to watch. His prejudices are the main reason for that.

Quickly, though, he sees that this young man and his sister ""Sue"" (Ahney Her) are being bullied by their thuggish extended family - a gang of obnoxious would-be gangsters who drive the streets picking fights and taunting people. He decides to intervene and the rest of the story sees a bond develop between him and his new ""family"" based on a degree of mutual understanding, trust, and ""Toad"" becoming his slave for a fortnight by way of penance! We are given some clues along the way as to the grand designs of ""Walt"" as he sets up a denouement, after a brutal assault on ""Sue"", that will satisfy not just himself, but keep his neighbours safe too. It's not the most naturally written dialogue, indeed at times it's quite forced but the underlying premiss of bigotry and the attitudes of intolerance and bullying are well addressed. The characterisation of the distant and prejudiced ""Walt"" is delivered engagingly, and with some dark humour, by a star/director who has a point to make. There's also quite a gently potent effort from Christopher Carley as the local priest. He is trying to offer the perfunctory words of hope and comfort to this veteran and he perseveres despite the dog's abuse he receives from a man who no longer feels it necessary to commit to the niceties of society. Clearly, ""Walt"" cares little for what is left of his life nor for any of his sins to be forgiven. It's about grief, relevance, community and I think it works. Give it a go.",7.0
13248,"**“A Christmas Carol”, over and over again.**

I've lost count of the versions, adaptations, rereadings and reconstructions I've seen of Charles Dickens's “A Christmas Carol”. I've heard it said that, with this tale, Dickens invented Christmas. I am not able to go that far, but I recognize that the tale changed the way we face this season: instead of being just a religious festival, it became a family celebration, much more secular and almost returning to its pagan roots. This is just another movie based on the tale.

For that reason, I won't waste my time talking about the script, we know how it ends. And perhaps because of this condition, I felt that this film lacks an additional dose of irreverence and humor, which tends to be more evident whenever the Looney Tunes are called. Here, the humor is essentially based on the amount of aggression, slaps and deformations that poor Daffy Duck can withstand for forty-five minutes. This ends up tiring after a while. I also felt that Bugs Bunny is lefting in the film, he acts almost like a “jiminy cricket”, a voice of conscience, and not like a plot character.

The film is technically very good and features several well-known voices for those familiar with the Tunes. Joe Alasky and Bob Bergen are especially good, however they are masters of the task at hand and I doubt this film was too challenging for them. Visually, the film is very elegant. I don't know if it was made using digital animation, I believe so, but the truth is that it seems to respect the aesthetics and traditional appearance of the dolls we grew up with.",4.0
13249,"Grim, relentless pursuit Western turns mystical in the last act

A vengeful former Confederate colonel (Liam Neeson) leads a small group of hirelings in an unyielding hunt for the former Union officer who horribly wronged him three years earlier (Pierce Brosnan). The only problem is that the latter is an expert fighter and survivalist.

This is a well done revenge Western with spectacular and varied remote Western locations (detailed below). If you thought Brosnan was a pretty boy as James Bond this movie will change your mind as he’s virtually unrecognizable as the skilled Rambo-like militarist. The tone is similar to contemporaneous Westerns like “The Missing” (2003) and “September Dawn” (2007), but with a revenge-chase plot. The final act throws in supernatural elements with characters like Mr. Charon (Wes Studi) and Louise C. Fair (Angelica Huston). You don’t have to think too hard to figure out who they really are. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot in Oregon (McKenzie River, Sahalie Falls and Koosah Falls), New Mexico (Lordsburg, Taos, Bramlett and Santa Fe), Arizona (Willcox Playa, Pirtleville, San Bernardino Valley and Chiricahua National Monument) and Death Valley National Park, California.

Seraphim Falls is directed by David Von Ancken who also co-writes with Abby Everett Jaques. It stars Liam Neeson, Pierce Brosnan, Michael Wincott, Xander Berkeley, Tom Noonan, Kevin J. O'Connor, John Robinson, Ed Lauter, Wes Studi and Anjelica Huston. Music is by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by John Toll.

It's post American Civil War, 1868, the Rocky Mountains, and Gideon (Brosnan) is being hunted by Colonel Morsman Carver (Neeson) and his hired killers. The reason why is not yet known, but it's the beginning of a relentless pursuit that's propelled by rage and hatred, a pursuit that will force both men to the day of reckoning.

The premise is as simple as it gets and on the surface the film holds no surprises until the divisive ending. However, before taking in the thematics of the story, it's refreshing to find a film of this genre type utilising the scenery to the max, whilst simultaneously playing out with sparse dialogue as two grizzled actors tell the story. An obvious forebear to ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", Seraphim Falls is ultimately a meditation on revenge and remorse. Moments of violence flit in and out of proceedings, these moments cloaked magnificently by natural surroundings, where the expansive wilderness plays host to the intimate human drama unfolding. It's also a film that pulses with mythical atmosphere, where Carver's pursuit of Gideon plays out like that of the Grim Reaper and his charges sent to capture the soul of the fleeing man. The falls of the title clearly indicates man's decent into hell, because it's not for nothing that the finale is played out on a blistering plain, which as you cast your eyes upon it, it is indeed hellish.

It's also worth noting that we the viewers are never sure who we should be rooting for - if either of them!? Gideon is out on his own, but he is an immensely skilled mountain man, one who is seemingly out skilling his pursuers. Is he the bad guy here? Or is it Neeson's Carver? One is ex Union, the other Confederate, this gives added spice to what then develops into a most intriguing journey. Where the film has irked some critics is with the ending, with some calling it pretentious and a very weak pay off. It's true enough to say that Ancken has slackened the grip slightly, as the tight gritty tone gives way to something more open and even airy. Yet I personally like it a lot, it helps to round out the supernatural feel that appears to loom as we have headed towards the day of reckoning. It lacks dramatic impact for sure, but thematically and for tonal bedfellow process, it pays off on what had gone before it.

Brosnan (stepping in when Richard Gere bailed out) and Neeson revel in the roles, seemingly enjoying the complexities and war torn burdens that their characters carry. Their scenes together are as professional as one could wish, both men comfortably doing world weary characterisations. Wincott is on hand for gravel voiced villain duties, his portrayal of Hayes is cold and in keeping with the movie. The other notable names in the cast drop in and out of the narrative, each important, and in the case of Huston and Studi, suitably weird. But the real star of the show is John Toll (Braveheart/Legends of the Fall), whose photography is pristine and  always remaining atmospheric, he captures the natural beauty of Oregon and New Mexico with great keen eyed skill. Switiching seamlessly from the blue, grey and whites of the mountain pursuit to the browns and yellows of the salt flats, we witness a master cinematographer at work.

Butterfly on a Wheel (AKA: Shattered) is directed by Mike Barker and written by William Morrissey. It stars Pierce Brosnan, Maria Bello and Gerard Butler. Music is by Robert Duncan and cinematography by Ashley Rowe. 

Butler and Bello play a seemingly happily married couple who have an adorable young daughter into the fold. Enter a rather sinister Brosnan who announces he has kidnapped the daughter and requires the couple to do everything he asks. Pressure is on then!?

Basically this is just real solid kidnap thriller film making, the kind that we were well served with back in the 1980s, and with that in mind this comes off like a throw back to that decade. Brosnan (how nice to see him doing a natural Irish brogue) grows ever more spiteful, while of course our handsome couple get more frantic.

But naturally there's a mystery going on here, we are left in no doubt about that there is something lurking beyond the edges of the frames. To which the inevitable twist, on which the whole pic's very being depends upon, will either make or break how you ultimately feel about the piece as a whole.

13279,"Lakeview Terrace is a tense, psychological thriller that stands out because of Samuel L. Jackson's powerful performance. He plays Abel Turner, a character so commanding and relentless that his presence carries the entire movie. Jackson's ability to make you both fear and understand Abel is what makes this film so gripping. The movie builds its suspense slowly, creating a tense and uneasy atmosphere that keeps you on edge throughout.

The plot tackles some heavy themes, particularly around race and power dynamics, which might feel a bit heavy-handed at times. While the racial aspect of the story may not sit well with everyone, it undeniably fuels the conflict and drives the tension between the characters. The film isn't subtle in how it approaches these themes, but that bluntness works in its favor, keeping the stakes high and the audience engaged.

The third act might divide viewers, but it ties the story together in a way that feels fitting for the characters, especially Abel. While some might argue it leans into thriller clichés, it also delivers closure that matches the relentless nature of the movie's lead. Overall, Lakeview Terrace is a solid watch if you're in the mood for a psychological thriller with strong performances and a story that isn't afraid to be provocative. It's not perfect, but it's well worth your time.",6.0

13320,"Despite the presence of Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire, I think this film actually belongs to Kay Thompson. She plays really well as the 1950s version of Dame Anna Wintour in this amiable, if a little thinly spread, musical comedy. Infuriated by the rather drab quality of her latest ""Quality"" magazine, she determines to revamp the whole thing. In pink! A bookshop being used for a photo shoot by ""Avery"" (Astaire) provides the unlikely source for her new model - ""Jo"" (Hepburn) who is to the fashion industry what Herod was to babies. ""Avery"" is clever, though, and he offers a trade off that sees her do a shoot in Paris in return for a meeting with ""Prof. Flostre"" (Michel Auclair). What now ensues is all fairly predictable, a love triangle with ""Jo"" in the middle vacillating. George & Ira Gerschwin provided the musical numbers, and though they are very well staged, the film lacks a killer song. That said, Thompson is on super form as the no-nonsense boss, the dance numbers are colourful and energetic and finally, Hepburn has a lovely vivacity and enthusiasm to her performance - she takes to the musical numbers very much like a duck to water. Astaire isn't at his best, and Robert Flemyng's accent isn't the best either - but at the end, the whole thing falls into place with an enjoyable certainty.",7.0

Bruce Lee only half finished a version of this film before he died in 1973. Five years later director Robert Clouse who made Enter the Dragon with Lee completed the film.

In order to do this, he used the existing footage with Lee, also used stock footage from previous Lee films and got a double and shot new footage with a new story line.

The result is a choppily edited film despite getting Hollywood actors such as Dean Jagger and Gig Young as well as John Barry to do the musical score. In fact Jagger gets some awful dialogue.

It is nice that they shuffled the structure around a little, giving Kumar the love interest instead of Harold, but he's still the ""problem causer"" in the pair.  This turns into more abuse humor focused on Harold, even more than the first movie.

Where the first movie had a much more passive antagonist and it was more of situational adversity, this has the U.S. Government as an active antagonist.  This makes it political and a little less fun, but more importantly it about them running FROM something as opposed to running TO something.

While this formula is a little less fun by structure, they managed to up the ridiculousness of the situations from the first movie.  I honestly think they just did everything they thought they couldn't get away with in the original.

Of course the viewing quality is subpar, but when I saw it is on a streaming service I don’t subscribe to, I decided to watch my flawed copy. I didn’t quite like it as much as I did previously, but perhaps the intervening 30 years have something to do with that. It is still a pleasant watch. Corey Haim does a fine job portraying the brainy nerd who is advanced scholastically and attends with students a couple years old than he is. He is basically a Junior high (or middle school) student in high school.

Lucas spends much of the movie pretending. He assumes he has a chance with an attractive older girl who obviously just wants to be friends, he tells fibs about his living situation, and he unrealistically tries out for the football team.

I thought the movie could have done more with Winona Rider’s character. She has a few lines but she is interested in Lucas herself, and I suspect more of her was on the cutting room floor. The scenes of the actual football plays on the field were totally false. I know that science fiction, for example, doesn’t always use appropriate science to explain stuff that happens, but just a little consulting with someone who knows the game at all could have made the plays accurate without changing the result. Come on, refs!

The influence of that rebellion alone is actually quite interesting, and as you watch this film you realize the design and the work that's gone on behind the scenes for things that we see every day and likely take for granted. Afterall, someone had to invent it at some point (like I've always said, the first person who figured out that you could drink cows' milk had to have been really weird).

After a good first movie, a series of sequels that alternated between the horrible and the tolerable, and even a TV series (which I've never seen, but I don't feel like watching either), the Highlander franchise brings us the latter. film, which tries to be the sequel to its predecessor.

What we have here is, essentially, a TV movie made with a very limited budget and the small minds that usually work for TV. I wish I could say a little more about the script, but the only thing I will say is that the film, set in the near future, shows a dystopian and dark humanity, and the Immortals try to find the Source of Immortality in Europe (and we can assume it's the origin of the powers and immortality they already possess, of course). Duncan, like Connor before him, is doomed to cheesy suffering in all things women, but his girlfriend, by an incredible coincidence, the kind that only happens in movies, is the only living being who knows the way to that source! In addition to a poorly written and absurd script, we have bad dialogue, innocuous and very idiotic villains and a series of characters that are simply underwritten.

Adrian Paul is quite weak, and seems to only be able to handle the role of protagonist for his youth and heartthrob appearance. Thekla Reuten, who is tasked with being the beautiful girlfriend of this film, also doesn't do anything particularly relevant and the rest of the cast doesn't deserve a real mention, because they do nothing more than show up, say what they have to say, die at the moment when they need to die. It seems that the producers were looking for students out of the dramatic course to make the film! Technically, we have standard cinematography, a little more televised than cinematic, and some decent CGI and special effects, but little else. Set in Eastern Europe, the film chose the filming locations reasonably well and is visually pleasing in many moments, but it doesn't bring anything truly good or surprising. The soundtrack takes advantage of some Queen hits, but in the voices and interpretations of other people.",1.0

Maybe that statement is a little facetious, but I feel it is true.  I read **_AMAZING_** reviews for this film.  I went in with high hopes, expecting a well acted, thoughtful, existential and quiet science fiction film.  

Instead I saw a film so poor I wondered what's the scam here?  How could this film possibly have a score in the high 7s.

The premise is solid at first glance, but as the film moves along it delves deeper and deeper in to melodrama, and then eventually patronising and insulting trash.  I am agnostic, but I found the religion bashing heavy handed and unnecessary. 

Most of the actors were doing the best they could with the script, but everything comes across flat and lifeless.  None of the characters rang true.  None of the dialogue sounded like how real people actually talk.  If you want to make a science fiction film that shies away from special effects, and instead relies on realism and storytelling, you had better make the dialogue realistic, and the storytelling compelling.  Sadly neither are found here.

The look of the film, I get that it is a low budget film made on a single location, but the quality of the film stock!  It may seem petty, but I could not get over the thought that I have seen better looking lifetime films.  Honestly I have seen better looking daytime soaps from the 80s.

Basically I don't get why anyone would call this film good, let alone a masterpiece.  I have read rave reviews, 10/10 reviews, gushing about how thought provoking and challenging this film was.  My thoughts were ones of disdain.  My challenge was to finish this abysmal film.  Many of the reviews seem to fixate on the fact that the writer of this wrote for the original Star Trek series.  That to me is not a good enough reason to rate this film highly.  

I honestly felt ripped off by this film.  I've been told I didn't get it, but sadly I did.  I understood every scene, I understood the implications, I understood the moral dilemmas and deeper meaning of what was being said.  It's just that the deeper meaning was shallow and unconvincing. I've been told maybe I should have watched Transformers instead.  Just for the record, I was looking forward to a slow, intelligent film minus explosions.  Instead I got, this.

13363,"The Man From Earth is a rare gem in indie filmmaking, a movie that relies solely on its thought-provoking writing and concept rather than flashy visuals or high-budget effects. Directed by Richard Schenkman and written by Jerome Bixby, the film unfolds entirely through dialogue, as a college professor reveals an extraordinary secret to his friends during an intimate gathering.

The story is the heart of the movie, blending history, philosophy, and science fiction into a compelling narrative. It challenges viewers to think deeply about humanity, mortality, and the nature of belief. Despite its minimalist approach, the script is captivating, offering twists and intellectual depth that keep the audience engaged.

However, the performances are uneven. While Richard Riehle stands out with a grounded and heartfelt portrayal, David Lee Smith as John—the enigmatic central character—falls flat. His portrayal lacks the emotional depth needed to make such a profound character relatable or compelling. Given John's fascinating background, this detachment feels like a missed opportunity to connect with the audience on a deeper level. The rest of the cast, including John Billingsley, deliver serviceable performances, but none leave a lasting impression.

What makes The Man From Earth truly unique is its appeal to open-minded viewers. It thrives on its ability to explore big ideas and timeless debates, inviting its audience to ponder questions about history, religion, and the limits of human understanding. While the lack of cinematic flair and some stiff performances may detract slightly from the experience, the strength of its writing and concept make it a must-watch for fans of intellectual storytelling.

Old Army buddies Bob and Phil become a hugely successful song and dance act once the war is over.

Falling in with two lovely sisters, Betty & Judy, the boys plan to put on a variety show with the girls to entice people back to the lodge. But misunderstandings and romantic leanings are not going to make this at all easy.

Enduring, perennial, simple and beguiling are all words fit to be associated with White Christmas. It's directed by Mr Reliable, Michael Curtiz, features songs from Irving Berlin and stars Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen & Dean Jagger. Filmed in Technicolor, it's also notable for being the first film to be shot in VistaVision (think wide-screen process). In truth the film is thinly plotted and doesn't remotely feature some of Berlin's best tunes, and I dare to be a touch more critical as the VistaVision is wasted on the studio led direction. Yet it's such a charming and heart warming film it feels churlish to let the negatives negate the over riding feeling of having been cheered after a viewing.

So although it's not the brilliance it perhaps should have been, it's ultimately a picture that still reels in new viewers every yuletide year, and that's something that is hard to argue with. So enjoy the title song and the likes of ""Sisters,"" ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing,"" ""Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep"" & ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"". Marvel at the zippiness of Vera-Ellen's dancing whilst lapping up the side-kick goofiness provided by the always watchable Kaye.

The writing is a bit hokey and sometimes predictable, but overall it is entertaining and quite watchable.

It's a cheery, gentle romantic comedy that puts a smile on your face and reinforces any faith in the human spirit that might need topping up.

The writing is often quite pithily amusing - the young lad has an habit of talking to saints, to whom he attributes his windfall, and writer Frank Cottrell Boyce quite cleverly uses this innocence and generosity of spirit to create a template for a look at just how we react when money is the raison d'être - too little, too much, sharing, hoarding, stealing...

13373,"Recently, I decided to watch the movie ""Millions,"" available on Disney+. I was unsure if it was an original Disney production or a film from another company that Disney acquired. Nevertheless, I had seen it on the platform multiple times and decided to give it a chance.

The story follows two brothers who stumble upon a large sum of money. One brother wants to invest and grow the money, while the other brother starts seeing spirits of people from Jesus' time and feels compelled to donate the money to charitable causes. As the plot unfolds, the siblings clash over how to handle the newfound wealth, leading to a series of conflicts and decisions.

The movie takes a peculiar turn when saints, apostles, and other spiritual figures begin appearing to communicate with one of the brothers. However, the narrative takes a surprising twist when it's revealed that the money was not a gift from God but rather the result of a robbery. This revelation shatters the boy's faith and leaves both the characters and the audience questioning the purpose of the spiritual encounters.

The film's direction becomes muddled as it struggles to reconcile the spiritual themes with the materialistic elements of the story. The protagonist, already a spiritual and kind-hearted child, is left disillusioned by the origins of the money, raising doubts about the film's underlying message and the significance of the supernatural encounters.

Brighton Rock is directed by John Boulting and written by Graham Greene (also 1938 novel) and Terence Rattigan.

Music is scored by Hans May and cinematography is by Harry Waxman. Plot finds Attenborough as small time Brighton hoodlum Pinkie Brown, whose attempts to cover up a murder sees events spiral out of control for himself and those closest to him. 

1947 was a good year for tough, gritty British drama, in fact it was a key year in the progression of British cinema. It was the year that would see the release of They Made Me A Fugitive, It Always Rains On Sunday, Odd Man Out and Brighton Rock. The latter film, arguably the one that looks the most dated, is the one that shocked the most upon its release. Refreshing, then, to find that in spite of the aged edges of the narrative frame, it still today has a power, a bleakness, that justifies the classic status afforded it. Part seedy seaside noir, part character driven observation on Catholic guilt and torment, Brighton Rock overcomes some slight old time technical flaws to thrive on thematic potency and a tense narrative. 

Many authors find their respective work losing impetus during the translation to the big screen, Graham Greene is one who hasn’t had to suffer in that department. Key issue for those adapting his work is to understand the characterisations at work, thankfully the Boulting brothers grasp that Pinkie Brown, surely one of Greene’s greatest creations, has a complexity that needs him front and centre of the brewing maelstrom. The plot then tumbles out around him, as the seedy underbelly of Brighton’s everyday life is exposed. The casting of Attenborough as Pinkie was a masterstroke, fresh faced and wide eyed, Attenborough plays it as coiled spring like, his psychosis troubling and ready to explode at any given moment. His cold hearted relationship with the homely, desperate for love, Rose (Marsh), is utterly disturbing, and it’s that relationship that underpins the story. 

Story is set amongst two sides of Brighton, one side is sunny, full of lights, fun-fairs and candy floss, the other features grimy boarding houses, penny café’s and loud back street beer houses. The neat trick the Boulting’s pull is that we know the sunny side is merely a facade to darker forces, much of the badness is played out to the backdrop of seaside frivolity and relaxation. With the iconic pier serving as a dual witness to both the good and bad side of Brighton’s current denizens. Aided by Waxman’s oppressive photography, J Boulting paints in claustrophobic strokes, perfectly enveloping the lead protagonists in a number of restrictive set-ups, where the surroundings deftly match the mood of the individual. It’s going to end bad, it has too, the atmosphere tells us that, but the makers are reveling in tightening the noose one turn at a time, and that’s a sure fire bonus for film noir lovers. 

Film is well cast across the board, with Hartnell most notable as Pinkie gang member, Dallow, while Baddeley as Pinkie’s bold and brassy adversary, Ida Arnold, is suitably annoying. Memorable characters, one and all, each one serving to add fuel to Attenborough's malevolent fire. How great it is to also take away a number of memorable scenes from the movie. From the pulse raising chase at the beginning; to the weird and haunting brutality of a ghost train sequence, and to the cruel finale that drips with cynicism, it’s a film that refuses to leave the conscious after the credits have rolled. The ending may have been toned down from that of the novel, but what remains still bites hard, as does, in truth, the whole film. 9/10",10.0
13385,"Richard Attenborough and William Hartnell are both at the top of their game with this edgy and gritty adaptation of Graham Greene's novel of small-time, seaside, thuggery. The former is ""Pinkie"", the leader of a group of glorified ruffians who finds himself being chased by the police and just about everyone else following his revenge killing of a journalist whom he thought topped one of his gang. Hartnell is formidable as his nemesis ""'Dallow"" and this also features a career-defining performance from Hermione Baddeley (""Ida"") who has also determined to get to the truth about the murder. John Boulting uses tight photography, the Brighton scenario, the darkness of alleys, the pier, the sea and the skill of Attenborough in portraying this cowardly bully of a man to good effect and creates one of the best British crime dramas that, though set before it, still exudes some of the ghastliness of WWII and of those odious little men who tried to capitalise on the misfortune of others. A solid supporting cast and some well focussed dialogue building on the original story make for quite a compelling cinema experience and it's aged well.",7.0

I recall my late mum always used to make sure we sat down in front of the telly at Christmas to watch this - and we probably saw it every year for about 30 years! Why? Well, it's an eminently watchable animation depicting a young lad who builds a snowman, only for it to come to life and take him on a few adventures on Christmas eve - including getting to meet and have a bit of a ceilidh with Santa - before, unfortunately, reality kicks in next morning. Aside from an introduction from a very handsome looking David Bowie, the rest of the audio belongs to a masterful score from Howard Blake (with a bit of help from Peter Auty) and the animation is mischievous and super.

They don't have much to go on, but determine to painstakingly follow what little clues they have in the hope that they can identify the mother of this pitiful bundle. Along the way, we find ourselves in a semi-comical environment as the three make progress - almost despite themselves. Confused, yes? Muddled? Yes, that too - but the sum of the three individuals proves to be worth far more than the value of each part. They function as a team because they shouldn't - and that is where much of the humour and the potency of the drama comes from. The animation is stylish and the hues and shades are particularly effective at illustrating their environment and at complimenting the humorous elements of their detective work. For some, 2022 attitudes may show up some of the character cracks that would have been groundbreaking at the start of this new millennium, but given it was made when it was - it tackles quite a few issues with a candour - and vivacity - that all works well to create an entertaining, charming and at times just a little thought-provoking animation.",7.0
13417,"Obviously not as good as its predecessor, but I had a fun time with <em>'Kronk’s New Groove'</em>.

Like with <em>'The Emperor’s New Groove'</em>, all the goodness comes with the humour which is again amusing. David Spade (Kuzco), who only appears for short cameos here, is definitely missed but Patrick Warburton (Kronk) does a respectable job at leading this sequel.

The premise isn't as memorable as the 2000 production's, with them deciding to split a few flashback stories across the relatively short run time. I'm not usually a fan of doing that (see: <em>'Tarzan & Jane'</em>), but Elliot M. Bour, Saul Andrew Blinkoff & co. do well to keep things interesting. The format probably works better for these films due to them not taking themselves too seriously; which is a positive.

It's nice to hear the return of Warburton, Spade, John Goodman (Pacha) and others - I'm likely to enjoy a follow-up film more if the same cast remain, changes almost always end up in failure. Tracey Ullman is one of a couple newcomers to this, she's alright as Miss Birdwell.

13446,"**It's a good film, but it's very damaged by the abuse of alcohol, drugs and tobacco, and by the weakness of the script, in terms of narrative.**

I expected a lot more from this movie, I have to confess. It is considered by many to be one of the best British comic films, and there is no doubt that the dialogues and situations were extremely funny, and it is not difficult to laugh at the absurd situations and conversations that are observed here. But it's also no lie that the film is far from being a work of perfection.

The script is based on the coexistence between two characters, Withnail and another boy, whose name is never mentioned, and who supposedly tells the story in the first person. They are two aspiring actors, absolutely failed, penniless and sharing expenses and an apartment in Camden during the late 60s, that is, in the midst of the cultural revolution and the golden years of drug use. Tired of the rot in which they live, they decide to go to the country house of a Withnail's uncle, not knowing that the place is inhospitable for the city dwellers.

The film has its moments, and this is largely due to a well written set of dialogues and absurd situations. Particularly memorable is the way in which Withnail practically deifies alcohol, not being able to remain sober for a minute, or the way in which he decides to go fishing with a shotgun, or even the journey of the two friends, in a beautiful old Jaguar that is truly a shame to see so mistreated. Unfortunately, the script and story don't go much further than this, and there isn't much material to support the film. On a narrative level, it is decidedly a very weak film. However, I was able to easily deal with it.

The film will only be as good as the audience is willing to “let it flow” without thinking too much about it, simply taking advantage of the many comic opportunities created. More than once, I felt that the film would work perfectly as a stage play, even more so than in the cinema. Very difficult to digest, however, is the constant apology for alcohol and drugs. I am sure that this was not the intention of the producers, but the fact that the characters are under the use of these substances for so long can really bother current audiences, who view the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and drugs in cinema less sympathetically. I tend to be quite open about this, but several times, in several scenes, I felt that the film was treading on dangerous ground in this regard.

The film has a reduced cast and only three actors deserve a mention. Richard Grant and Paul McGann made their cinematic debut with this film… and what a debut! Grant, perhaps without ever having imagined it, had the role of his career in this film, as no other work of his was as popular and as remarkable as this one. McGann was also very good, although he is not able to compete much with Grant, who has a much more intense and complex character. The late and late Richard Griffiths also appears here and plays a small role, but one that is very well done.

The film is not brilliant on a technical level, but there are some points I would like to highlight, the cinematography being the most relevant of them all. I don't know how this was achieved, but it is very evident that the film was able to emulate the look and characteristics of a film made in the 60s. I believe that the secret was in the light, in choosing the right film and the most suitable camera, as well as a good set of costumes and props. I especially enjoyed seeing Withnail's costume. In his clothes, he looks like a seedy, broke, alcoholic Mr. Darcy. There are also some visually notable scenes, like the roadside scenes, or the scene where the two friends leave Monty's house, and we see the stately demolition of an old Victorian house behind them.",4.0
13446,"Just what exactly was it lurking in the sink? Probably best not to know as we meet the dipso ""Withnail"" (Richard E. Grant) and his marginally more respectable pal who'd be the ""Marwood/I"" (Paul McGann). Two ""resting"" actors who haven't tuppence to rub together. A visit to his gay uncle ""Monty"" (Richard Grffiths) provides them with some fine wine and with the key to his remote country cottage where they duly adjourn for an holiday. They don't exactly fit in, indeed having no money, firewood, fuel or much of a clue just antagonises the locals. The bracing country air - and the relentless rain - just isn't for them, and their situation only gets worse when ""Uncle"" comes a calling and takes a bit of a shine to the frankly rather terrified ""Marwood""! What happens next? The first hour of this is great fun, with Grant and McGann working well together delivering a pithy and ripe script that is peppered with quick-wittedness and dry humour. I'm not sure just how much acting Griffiths was actually doing here, but he steals the scene every time - especially as he closes in on his would-be, hapless, prey in the middle of a thunderstorm! Plaudits also to their mate ""Danny"" (Ralph Brown) - a sort of urban sophisticate who's permanently stoned! The cast is tightly knit and though it does lose steam towards the end, I reckon it's still one of the best examples of comedy reflecting a side of 1980s Britain that steers clear of the obvious Mrs. Thatcher-bashing, but still offers quite a keen assessment of the triumph of expectation over hope!

13448,"Faith is a gift I have yet to receive.

Angels and Demons is directed by Ron Howard and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman from the Dan Brown novel of the same name. It stars Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Armin Mueller- Stahl. Music is scored by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Salvatore Totino.

Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is summoned to Rome and asked by the Vatican to help when four cardinals are kidnapped. Upon examining a tape recording that announces that the cardinals will be killed one at a time hourly, Langdon places the crime at the door of the ancient Illuminati. It's a race against time to not only try and save the lives of the cardinals, but also to avert the detonation of an anti-matter bomb which will destroy Vatican City. 

In spite of The Da Vinci Code making gargantuan amounts of cash, there were many who actively hated the movie. Yet this follow up from Howard and his makers still enticed just under $500 million's worth of worldwide paying punters into see it. Ultimately it's a very different movie to Da Vinci, where that film was sombre and talky, and had a great religious hook that caused tremors in Christianity, Angels and Demons is a pacey race against time serial killer thriller. Albeit one that is still religion based and additionally topped up with some sci-fi gubbins. 

The ticking time bomb format works well as a cliff hanger and the narrative allows Langdon and his latest lady investigator, CERN scientist Vittoria Vettra (Zurer), scope for no-nonsense detective work. There's a good solid mystery story at the heart, one which doesn't veer to being over complicated, and the production value is of a very high standard. Casting is first class, with McGregor and Skarsgard complimenting the reliable, and thankfully new haircut sporting, Hanks. It's a little draggy in the mid-section, as history comes crashing into the mix and the makers feel the need to be cerebral, and the finale is bizarre if wholly appropriate, but herein lies the problem 

If you can judge it on its own terms, not as a Dan Brown novel recreation and a link to bad memories of Da Vinci Code (not me, I liked it well enough actually)? Then it's a film of simple pleasures. If not then it kind of goes without saying that you probably already dislike the movie! 7.5/10",7.0
13455,"***People with various mental abilities fighting each other in Hong Kong over a suitcase***

Three individuals with mind powers in Hong Kong (Chris Evans, Dakota Fanning & Camilla Belle) vie with agents of a shadowy government agency called the Division over a mysterious suitcase. The super powers include pushers, who can push thoughts into other’s minds; movers, who have the power of telekinesis; watchers, who are seers; sniffers, who can find others; shadowers, who can block watchers and sniffers; screamers, who can attack through shrieks; and more. Djimon Hounsou plays the head agent of the Division. 

“Push” (2009) is a thriller that combines the style and themes of “Lucy” (2014) with the surreal take on a major Asian city of “Lost in Translation” (2003). Imagine the abilities of Professor X, Jean Grey and Magneto of the “X-Men” flicks, but without the costumes and superhero trappings, and you’d have a good idea of “Push.” The setting of Hong Kong is a highlight, but it focuses mostly on the working class underbelly rather than the posh areas of Tokyo seen in “Lost in Translation.”

The style is hip and kinetic, like “Lucy” and “Eye of the Beholder” (1998), and the film does a good job of keeping the complicated elements understandable to the viewer. There’s also a quality score/soundtrack. Yet it’s the least of all these pics mentioned. The story’s just not as engrossing, but it’s not too far off either. The Division is suggestive of MK Ultra on steroids.

13457,"Doc Rock and the playboy redemption. 

Magnificent Obsession is adapted from a novel by Lloyd C Douglas, and it had been previously filmed back in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor in the leads. Here the piece is directed by melodrama maestro Douglas Sirk and features Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson as the emotionally charged leads. The story revolves around Bob Merrick (Hudson), a playboy who is inadvertently responsible for the death of Helen Phillips' (Wyman) husband. As he starts to find a soul in amongst his playboy image, he desperately wants to make peace with Helen, but during his efforts to apologise she is tragically blinded in an accident. As Helen recuperates, Bob worms his way into Helen's life by posing as someone else, they amazingly start to fall in love, but the truth will out and tragedy seems to permanently hover over this newly formed alliance.

As with the best of Douglas Sirk, Magnificent Obsession is loaded with drama and unashamed assaults on the viewers emotional fortitude. It is quite simply a weeper, a stress relief server for those so inclined. No bad thing that, though, just as long as the viewer is fully aware of the type of film they are getting. To only market it as a romance piece is something of a disservice because at the core it's one of redemption, where even religion is neatly threaded into the deftly assembled script. Technically it has a lot going for it, Frank Skinner's score is smoothly gorgeous, with Chopin's Études perfectly accompanying the blossoming romance, while the colour photography from Russell Metty is sensibly unobtrusive. Rock Hudson would jump on to the map with his performance here (proving he could act if given the meat to chew on), and Wyman would get Oscar nomination for her emotionally driven turn. All in all it's a film that's well worth watching, on proviso if you choose to be in that weeper frame of mind! 7.5/10",7.0

Well that's soon a matter for the law and things are going to ge even messier for the friends and he is imprisoned and they have to get to the bottom of a dastardly plot involving some weasels and Toad Hall itself. Then, we morph seamlessly onto the equally mellifluous tones of Bing Crosby who takes us through a not so enjoyable interpretation of ""Sleepy Hollow"". We follow the almost vulture-like ""Ichabod Crane"" as he arrives in the village as the school teacher and who then sets about wooing local heiress ""Katriona"" - much to the chagrin of local beefcake ""Bron"". ""Crane"" seems to have the upper hand at every turn until the younger man hits on a idea to, quite literally, resurrect a creature from the depths of the graveyard to finally remove this obstacle from his path to true love (and a decent sized fortune too). The animations are old style Disney with plenty of vivid colours and, certainly for ""Toad, characterful animations. The second story features just a little too much music - our renowned crooner manages at least two songs, and the characterisations rely much more on their physical attributes and less on their ""acting"" if you will.

Rachel Nichols delivers a performance that makes her terror and resolve feel genuine and convincing and adds some realism to the film. So much better than what you would expect in a low-budget horror movie. Watching her character develop from panicked to decisive and strong is a major film highlight.

13475,"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2013**

I did like _Star Trek_. I did not, however, appear to like it as much as the rest of the whole damn planet.

I appreciate the decent helping of Australian actors in the mix (like personal favourite Chris Hemsworth, above). I can get behind the colourful and impressive special effects spectacle. Most of all I dig the reboot angle they pulled. The whole time travel/tangent universe thing is the perfect breeding of remaining true to the original, while still not constricting themselves to the old canon. Fantastic idea.

But I didn’t love it. I’m a big fan of origin stories, but I personally feel that _Star Trek_ never really breached past that point. The first half was brilliant, getting to know the characters, the world, the ideals, everything. But in the latter half it seems they just sort of went “Well, we spent a bunch of time doing stuff good, but now we don’t have enough time left to make an actual movie out of this… Oh well, just chuck an hour of lasers in there and we’ll worry about that next film!” which just isn’t good enough. When _Into Darkness_ comes out later this year, the format will probably pay off, but looking at the merits of Star Trek alone, I think it fell short.

Simon Pegg (_Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead_) as the new Scotty and Zachary Quinto (_American Horror Story, Heroes_) as the new Spock were both solid choices, but other casting decisions like Winona Ryder (_Black Swan, Alien: Resurrection_) as Spock’s mother were an off-shot in the worst possible way.

I suppose though, in science fiction, it’s often safety first and little steps. As a member of what is probably the most frowned upon of the genres, I wish this Star Trek reboot all the best in its inevitable future, and it seems it will make good use of it. But for now, the solo film itself didn’t reach as far as I felt it could have with a little harder work towards the end.

It's not an understatement to say that the news of a new Star Trek movie was met in equal measure by suspicion and pretty low expectations. Step forward J.J. Abrams to direct it, and many wondered while the guy behind TV series ""Lost"" and ""Mission Impossible III"" would want to dabble on hallowed sci-fi turf?. Things were further eyebrow raising when Abrams openly admitted to not having been a fan of the original show so cherished by a legion of Trekkies. Then news came of the film being a prequel, based around the Starfleet Academy and the coming together of what we know as the U.S.S. Enterprise crew. ""Ooh that will be a tough one to carry off"" said many, ""Kirk & Spock as young spunkers - surely not"" they said. Well not only did Abrams pull it off as it were, he simultaneously appeased most Trekkies whilst garnering a whole new generation of sci-fi observers. Budgeted at $140,000,000, Abrams Star Trek went on to gross Worldwide $384,953,778. Figures that, even allowing for the huge fan-base that the franchise has, show that many first timers not only went to see it - but also that they enjoyed it so much they went back for second helpings. I know I did.

The success of the film isn't hard to fathom, because although Abrams upped the action quota (with a number of breath taking and eye appealing sequences) he also dispensed with much of the sci-fi psycho babble that has blighted some of the previous filmic instalments in this most up and down of franchise's. Sure there's stuff in there for the discerning fan, with a time travelling revenge plot at its axis, how could there not be?, But Abrams and his writers (Roberto Orci /Alex Kurtzman) keep it simple, savvy and sexy. They smartly link to Trek lore with a crucial plot and character development featuring the Kobayashi Maru, while pain, emotional conflict and personal crisis all feature heavily. This is, one can ""logically"" say, a spiky post 9/11 Trek movie. There's even room for a romantic strand, a strand that is tender and fits the whole make-up of the piece perfectly. All of which only works because the cast are, in the main, producing great work.

Getting Leonard Nimoy to appear in a small, but crucial role, is nothing short of being a master-stroke. His presence keeps the all important essence of Star Trek within what is ultimately a reboot. It's like a father figure watching over proceedings, making not only the cast feel safe, but also us the viewers. The youngsters in the cast are impressive, Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock) and Zoe Saldaña (Uhura) lead from the fresh faced front. While Karl Urban (Bones McCoy) and Simon Pegg (Scotty) impact with comic relief that aids instead of hinders the plot developments. Villain duties falls to Eric Bana as Romulan Captain Nero, he's a touch miffed is Nero, and Bana brings the character's vengeful pain vividly to life. While Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike adds a touch of class that he almost always seems to do.

This U.S.S. Enterprise has launched itself in another direction, and yes, it's boldly going where no-one has boldly gone before. It is, all told, a bona fide blockbuster with brains and balls. The like of which has sadly been missing from many a modern era summer release. Yes it's not all perfect, the odd scene could quite easily have been jettisoned, and some accents need a bit of fine tuning, but they are very minor complaints. A triumph from Abrams and his team - note the Stardate in the ships log, for this is a noteworthy moment in modern sci-fi cinema.

The legend of the James/Younger gang gets another outing in this fanciful actioner that's guaranteed to have history buffs frothing at the mouth.

It very much comes off as a Western primed for the MTV generation, a young spunky cast are assembled and the action kitchen sink is thrown at the piece where ever possible. There's lashings of cool on show, some sexiness, and the prime action sequences are exciting. Yet it just comes off as soulless, something emphasised by the awful score and soundtrack.

Acting is OK, particularly from Timothy Dalton as Allan Pinkerton, the man tasked with bringing down Colin Farrell's Jesse James - this whilst having a grudging respect for the outlaw - while Gabriel Macht puts some assured calmness into the role of Frank James. Elsewhere everyone else is having fun even though they be hamstrung by the script.

13496,"SPOILERS AHEAD!  ""American Outlaws"" is cinematic proof that the American public will watch just about anything, even a film that makes ""Young Guns"" look like ""The Searchers.""

Colin Farrell is Jesse James and Gabriel Macht plays his brother Frank. After the film opens with perhaps the most fun ever had at a Civil War battle, the Jameses and Youngers head home to Missouri. There, evil railroad executives have moved into the state in record time and are trying to buy everyone's land to build a railroad. Farms are burned, people killed, and the Youngers and Jameses have had it. After Ma James (Kathy Bates, here for the paycheck) is killed in an attack, the guys decide to stick it to the man by robbing banks where the railroad company does business. The rest of the film is a series of explosions as the gang robs, Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton) tries to track James down, and the boys escape from one pickle to another.

This film is stupid. So stupid. First of all, all the characters are straight out of a screenplay seminar: Jesse the dashing hero, Zee (Ali Larter) his love interest, Frank the smart one, Cole Younger (Scott Caan) the hothead, Bob Younger (Will McCormack) the ""funny"" one, Jim Younger (Gregory Smith) the boy who you know will die, Tom (Nathaniel Arcand) the politically correct Native American Indigenous People Indian Scout guy whose sole function here is to add some color to the cast of white guys, Rains (Harris Yulin) and Parker (Terry O'Quinn) are the villains, Ma James is the religious nut who has no problem with guns and killin', and Pinkerton, who enjoys the chase of James more than the capture. All the young men wear cool clothes and brandish magical pistols that reload themselves. Thank goodness everyone over thirty five is an idiot, so as these rascally killers can go John Woo/Chow Yun Fat all over their gold-filled rumps and do serious damage without ever killing an innocent bystander. Electric guitar riffs fill the soundtrack, and the film goes through all its preordained set pieces where the outcome has already been determined yet the film makers treat them as if they invented the genre. If you need to see cute guys without their shirts on, go online. If you need to see a decent western, watch anything but this. The entire cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves for coming up with this and shooting it. Did we learn nothing from ""The Brady Bunch,"" when Bobby worshiped Jesse James until Mike brought home the son of one of the outlaw's victims? Why is that decades old sitcom more responsible than this dung? Wanna know the kicker to this whole migraine of a movie? Ma James is killed, prompting the boys to take revenge on the railroad. In real life, she outlived Jesse by almost forty years.

There's no flow or reason for instances, the characterisations veer from possibly interesting to sideline dummies. 

It was held back for release by the studio for two years +, and tinkered with by Jack the Ripper in the editing room, so it's hardly surprising it was a major flop and didn't even make enough money back to pay for the post party cakes.

L'ennemi intime (Intimate Enemies) is a raw picture looking at French conscripts during the Algeria War. It was a war that was fought for 8 years between 1954-1962, it was also a war that France failed to even acknowledged had existed until over three decades later. Pic picks up the thread in 1959 and the focal point is the relationship between Lieutenant Terrien (Benoît Magimel) and Sergent Dougnac (Albert Dupontel). The former is the new guy, idealistic, while the latter is the grizzled and battled scarred veteran.

The Barbarian Hordes.

With the French locked in battle against the Algerian rebels, the film runs the protagonists through the psychological mangler. The horrors of war are born out, with both sides of the conflict depicted with a barbarity that's harrowing in nature. As the pic progresses you can see Terrien being worn down by what he observes, the key being he is losing his idealistic heart. Moral dilemmas are deftly inserted into the screenplay, but disappointingly the political thrum that was driving the conflict is given short shrift.

From an action stand point director and co-writer Florent-Emilio Siri strikes hard, with two particular sequences - one a field of fleeing soldiers and the finale involving air-strikes - outstanding in construction. Siri also knows when to tighten the emotional noose, bringing to us poignant scenes that leave a lump in the throat. Giovanni Fiore Coltellacci's cinematography is also to be applauded, muted colours mingle with stark framing compositions to really give the sense of realism that the screenplay demands and deserves.

Aside from the lack of political basis (we need to know more about this war), the only other real problems with the piece is the conventionality, and that it inevitably is filled with war film stereotypes. However, this is very good film making and the makers bring the story to vivid life, always remaining fascinating and certainly unforgettable. 8/10",8.0

The film could have spent more time on describing the older electric car technology -- I was unaware that in the early 1900s there were, in fact, already cars that didn't run just on gasoline. I found it laughable when, near the end of the movie, the creators assess that essentially everyone, including car companies, oil companies, CARB, even consumers (!) are to blame for electric's downfall. I think you could convince me of car & oil companies, but it's a real stretch to say that a regulator that simply didn't adopt stricter guidelines 'killed' an industry, or that people did because they didn't buy this amazing product.

13515,"The mirrors. They're so clean.

Mirrors is the American remake of a little known Korean film called Into the Mirror. The plot has Kiefer Sutherland as a recovering alcoholic cop, who whilst on suspension is taken to working as a security guard at a large burnt out department store and starts to see terrifying images in the many mirrors about the place... 

You would think that Mirrors was a flop. The critics hated it and the horror hordes were very much divided on it, the latter of which is to be fair the norm for any big horror movie release. Yet it didn't flop, it did very well at the box offices of the world and has a decent 6.2 average on IMDb, which for a divisive horror film is well above average.

Mirrors overstays its welcome, there really was no need for it to run to just under two hours in length. While elsewhere there's some pretty poor dialogue, parts of the screenplay are pointlessly soap opera in nature, while some thinking will make you scratch your head in bewilderment at events outside of the brilliantly monolithic department store.

However, does Mirrors create a genuinely spooky atmosphere (the interiors of the store are creep fest nirvana), insert some shock moments to jolt you out your seat? Is it visually stylish, with sound work to match? And does Sutherland (and to a degree Paula Patton as his wife) overcome the trite parts of the script and give effective and committed performances? The answer to those questions is yes.

Does the ending cop out in any way? Insult the audience? No! It doesn't do that either.

It has flaws, but they are not insurmountable for the horror fan who's just looking for some good scares, atmospheric dread and some stylish touches from the director (Alexandre Aja). If you haven't seen it then give it a try, judge for yourself, you might be pleasantly surprised at what you find. 7.5/10",7.5
13524,"This film is created out of composite characters, most notably Henry Fonda, as a Lt. Colonel in Intelligence and Robert Shaw, as a Panzer Brigade Commander supposedly just recalled from the Russian Front, where he was ""losing the war there"". 

According to the official account, the part Robert Shaw fictitiously portrayed wasn't the Colonel Hessler he was titled as, but; Joachim Peiper,  and the following is from the official account; ""The 6th Panzer Army included the elite of the Waffen-SS, including four Panzer divisions and five infantry divisions in three corps. SS-Obersturmbannführer Joachim Peiper led Kampfgruppe Peiper, consisting of 4,800 men and 600 vehicles, which was charged with leading the main effort. However, its newest and most powerful tank, the Tiger II heavy tank, consumed 3.8 litres (1 gal) of fuel to go 800 m (.5 mi), and the Germans had less than half the fuel they needed to reach Antwerp."" 

The film was built around the German strategic objective being beyond their reach in fuel and other vital strategic materials. Why did they use fictitious characters where the real ones would have done even better? Less than 20 years after the war and the events makes the responsibility of depicting real historic and often heroic or infamous personalities a tall order for the mainstream cinema. One must remember that this was a commercial production, not an historic account. 

The famous and catchy song, sung in the movie as a theme of the Panzer Corp., in German, ""Panzerlied"", was written for the movie. It can be found on ""You Tube"" and is apparently both catchy and popular--- it also didn't happen that way. 

Still, to be fair, when we first got a Video player, around 1981, the first movie I watched was ""The Battle of The Bulge"", despite all its historical inaccuracies, because its entertaining and I'm sorry it has to end. In reality, it was more unpleasant than depicted and the Hollywood movie starring Van Johnson from around 1948, titled, ""Battleground"" presents a better reenactment, though also fictionalized and from the standpoint of 1 small allied unit rather than the broader scope depicted in ""The Battle of the Bulge"". 

This is an excellent, high budget film with good actors, and acting that shows both sides, and attempts to demonstrate what the ""Battle of the Bulge"" was actually about. It does this well, from a Hollywood standpoint, though films such as ""Patton"" were made a few years later using the real characters, and based on reliable source materials with somewhat less fictionalization.",5.0
13524,"***Nazi Germany’s last gasp***

“Battle of the Bulge” (1965) depicts the last major German offensive on the Western Front from December 16 – January 25, 1944-1945. The action takes place at the intersection of Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg. American forces were thoroughly surprised by the German attack on the morning of December 16th and took the highest casualties of any operation during WW2.

There are glaring inaccuracies, most notably the absence of Tiger and Sherman tanks, substituted by the US M47 Patton and M24 Chaffee. But the filmmakers had to use what was available to them in Spain in the non-CGI era of 1964. Speaking of the Spanish locations, some battle scenes were shot in flat, bare territory whereas the real locations, the Ardennes, were/are mountainous and forested. Thankfully, there are some sylvan sequences, as well as snowy ones, just not as much snow as in the real battle.

Critics also lambaste the film story-wise, but the filmmakers had to condense a 40-day battle into less than three hours and make it understandable and dramatic for the audience. The film gets the gist right and includes real-life pieces, like the infamous Malmedy Massacre. It also inspires interest in the subject to look up the real history.

Another highlight is the great cast with Robert Shaw outstanding as Colonel Hessler. Also featured are the likes of Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, George Montgomery, James MacArthur and so on.

The movie runs 2 hours, 47 minutes and was shot in Spain (Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range and Madrid).

13524,"It's far too long this, but otherwise isn't an half-bad wartime adventure that shows off Robert Shaw's ability to play a baddie with aplomb. He's ""Col.

With the Allies pressing every advantage, he must follow his faintly ridiculous orders and counter-attack - aiming to regain the port of Antwerp - against the well armed troops of ""Gen. Grey"" (Robert Ryan) who is being aided by his shrewd eye-in-the-sky ""Col. Kiley"" (Henry Fonda). This gent is very suspicious of the way the Nazis seem to have gone quiet. He knows they still have a formidable arsenal, and that one false step could see them becoming the target. ""Hessler"" has one vulnerability, though, and this is fuel. His tanks are superior and he has an element of surprise, but he must find petrol and ""Kiley"" knows this. The cat and mouse game that ensues is well enough directed by Ken Annekin, and includes a formidable array of Hollywood A-listers to help it along. He also tries to develop a story with a little more politics to it. The duplicity and mistrust that surrounds ""Hessler"" and his long-suffering ""Conrad"" (Hans Christian Blech) illustrating that the concept of blind loyalty - even pride - was still alive and well, even in those who ought to have realised better.

Gaslight is directed by George Cukor and is adapted to screenplay from Patrick Hamilton’s play by John Van Druten, Walter Reisch and John L. Balderston. It stars Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotton, May Whitty, Barbara Everest and Angela Lansbury. Music is by Bronislaw Kaper and cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg.

Years after her aunt was murdered in her London home, Paula Alquist Anton (Bergman) moves back there with her new husband, Gregory Anton (Boyer). However, what at first seems to be an idyllic marriage begins to crumble as Paula appears to be losing her mind…

You really have to put into context just how great Gaslight is as per the time it was released. For it holds up now as something of a torch igniter for what has followed over the decades. The psychological thriller – specifically that of a spouse being tormented by their partner – has been mined for all its worth - and will continue to do so. Even the terminology of very real life instances such as Gaslighted/Gaslighting have been born out from the pic, so if it is thought of being dated or old hat, its influence is still quite considerable.

It’s still a terrific atmospheric thriller anyway, played out to a magnificent backdrop of Victorian London, of fogs and cobbled streets, and of course gas lights and eerie shadows. Pic is split into two halves, first half is the set-up of a whirlwind romance that leads to marriage, then the move to the marital home and support characters - nosy neighbour (Whitty), housekeeper (Everest), tart housemaid (Lansbury on debut) - are introduced to proceedings. Deft psychological touches are being played out, though wonderfully we never actually see the misdirection machinations actually being done.

Then as the second half happens upon us it really hits the diabolical straps, the methodical manoeuvres of Gregory Anton really start to gnaw away at our senses. We witness Paula come apart, her mind fractured, so vulnerable and confused, you would have to have a heart of stone not to have your very core ache. It’s here where Bergman, in the first of her three Best Actress Oscar wins, excels without duff histrionics. Boyer also is superb, where guided by the astute Cukor he makes Gregory a dashing dastard, only given to subtle clues about his devious and wicked doings.

Cotton doesn’t try to do a British accent, which is fine as he holds his end up well as Brian Cameron, the man getting to grips with what’s actually going on in the Alton home. Brian is our hero in waiting, giving us something to hang onto as the pic reaches revelations point. With Ruttenberg (Oscar Nominated) drifting what would be known as noirish contrasts over the piece, and Kaper’s music unobtrusively subtle, Gaslight hits high marks for tech credit substance. All told it’s a truly great film, and one that’s well worth going back to if you become jaded with the more slick and polished production line genre pieces that follow in its wake. 9/10",9.0
13531,"**An animated film, full of rebellion and energy.**

Remember the stores that sold music records and CDs? There are still some, and the rebirth of vinyl, very recent, has allowed a certain rebirth of the commercial sector, somewhat in response to the massification and popularization of music in “streaming” and digital downloads that we already have as something common in our lives. This film is about a store open 24 hours a day, with spaces to sell and listen to music. It is managed by young people, with young employees, an idiot owner and a manager who dreams of buying the space. It turns out that one of the employees decided to go to a casino and lost all the money saved for that project.

The action takes place the day after the incident. In addition to the fate of the store and its employees, which is at stake, each one lives their own story, has characteristics and personality. Incidentally, the entire construction and development of the story and characters is one of the most positive aspects of the film. We have a young teenager who particularly wants to lose her virginity but has serious problems with amphetamines, an aspiring art major, a crook with a complicated childhood, a liberal girl who seems to particularly enjoy sexual adventures, a crazy rocker. In addition to the employees, we also have a former musical star who decides to go there to promote a new CD and cause some funny problems.

The film has an impressive cast, and it's worth seeing who the actors are and where they are today. We understand well that each one wanted to make the best use of this opportunity. Contrary to what the posters suggest, Liv Tyler, who is the daughter of a rock musician, has a character without a leading role, but does an excellent job, even acting opposite her (then) stepfather, Coyote Shivers. Rory Cochrane, Renée Zellweger and Ethan Embry are also here, and each of them does a very competent job. Despite the centrality of his character, Anthony La Paglia does not steal the spotlight for himself and shares our attention with his co-stars generously and doing a very well done job. We also have Robin Tunney, bald and rebellious, Debi Mazar and Johnny Whitworth. The less sympathetic roles go to Max Caulfield and Ben Bode, and they're refreshingly comic.

On a technical level, what stands out positively is the enormous animation of the film. There are no dead moments. The story is constructed in such a way as to give us a kind of moral about the brevity of life and the need to take advantage of the time, live life, even taking risks and making mistakes. Added to this is a strident soundtrack, full of strength, where rock predominates and emanates energy, positivity and rebelliousness. The songs used here are well known and fans of the rock genre will love it. Incidentally, the albums released with the soundtrack were a success, in absolute contrast to the film itself, which failed in cinemas, was bombed by critics and only acquired a certain popularity and public recognition in much more recent years.

The Changeling is directed by Peter Medak and co-written by Russell Hunter, William Gray and Diana Maddox. It stars George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Melvyn Douglas, John Colicos and Jean Marsh. Plot finds Scott as John Russell, a music composer whose life is shattered when an accident kills both his wife and young daughter. Relocating to Seattle, Russell rents a large Gothic style mansion from which to bury himself in his work. But he soon discovers he is not alone in the house, there is a ghost here and it desperately wants his help with something...

Not a teenager or a scantily clad bad actress in sight here, for this is a traditional haunted house spooker for the adults, one that has a distressing mystery at its core that's just aching to be solved. Chief writer Russell Hunter has based much of the film on an incidents that happened to him in real life when he moved into a house in Denver. If you believe him or not is not really the point, because it does not take away from just how well executed The Changeling is, both as a scary movie and a well thought out drama. There's limited characters in the narrative, thus keeping the film free from filler and the clumsy character set-ups that mar so many horror films these days. It's also worth noting that it doesn't suffer from dating either, as Nicole Kidman starrer The Others proved 21 years later, a haunted house tale can be effective in any decade if the writing and direction is spot on. The Changeling has both, plus a towering and believable performance from Scott leading the way.

Medak clearly knows that an imposing house is a key element. Utilising the big spaces to emphasise Russell's loneliness, he sweeps his camera around the sets (this is not a real house, it's a brilliant mock-up creation by the designers) to give the feeling of a spirit observing proceedings. The house is always a main character and acts as the perfect backdrop to some ghostly goings on (excellent work from the sound department too). The chills are genuine, the attic room is creepy personified, a rubber ball, a wheelchair, a bath sequence, an old water well and even the gentle tinkling from a music box, all induce the hairs on the back of the neck to stand to attention. And there's a séance! Oh yes indeed, a séance that's tape recorded, more chills down the spine on the way there as well. All played out to some lush unholy musical arrangements from Ken Wannberg (the music box theme composed by Howard Blake).

Setting it apart from conventional haunted house movies is that it has a most intriguing story to tell. One of murder, greed, deception and grief. The latter part is often forgotten when talk of The Changeling arises. John Russell is absolutely stricken with grief, this stops him from being one of those characters who you shake your head at because they refuse to leave a clearly troubled house. His grief process, which makes him the ideal host for what this spirit wants, means he has no fear, some unhappy ghost can't hurt him anymore than he is hurting anyway. It's a neat and seamless meditation on grief that's threaded into the story. The last quarter of the film slips into action territory, which is a little jarring given the smooth pacing Medak has favoured up to that point. But although the scares have gone, the intelligent story has come full circle and the film closes down triumphantly without copping out or having resorted to unimaginative formula.

An essential viewing for those who like haunted house movies; especially if you like slow build and genuine mystery as well. 9/10",9.0

A grieving composer (Scott) rents a mansion in Seattle that’s been unoccupied for a dozen years and starts a relationship with the Historical Society agent who offered it to him (Trish Van Devere). Unfortunately, the manor has a shameful history and weird things start happening.

""The Changeling"" (1980) is haunted house horror in the tradition of ""The Legend of Hell House"" (1973), ""The Evil"" (1978) and ""The Amityville Horror"" (1979). While it's not as good as ""Amityville Horror,"" it's pretty much on par with ""Legend of Hell House"" and “The Evil” and would influence future ghostly flicks, like ""The Ring"" (2002). 

The writer of the book and co-scripter, Russell Hunter, claimed the story is based on his experiences while living in the Henry Treat Rogers mansion in the Cheesman Park neighborhood of Denver in the late ’60s.

For me, the apparition is accorded too much power by the scriptwriters in the second half and this provokes a “Yeah, right” response rather than scares or awes. A good example is setting a house on fire at will. Why Sure!

An artist in Union Square, Manhattan, struggles with his homeless father, finishing a key painting, an annoying rock band in the building, and his relationship with his two female roommates. Insanity and worse can’t be too far away.

“The Driller Killer” was shot from June, 1977, to March, 1978 and released in 1979. I point this out because it reeks of late 70’s Manhattan, and not the pretty side. It’s a gritty art house Indie made by the protagonist, Abel Ferrara, who’s listed as actor Jimmy Laine in the credits.

Despite the exploitive title and the fact that it undeservedly ended up on the UK’s “video nasties” list, it’s actually a grungy psychological drama about life in the Big City in late 70’s America mixed with lowkey amusement concerning the country’s growing fringe decadence and corresponding lunacy. The “driller killer” element doesn’t manifest until the second half and isn’t exploited as in conventional slashers. Speaking of which, this aspect inspired the usage of driller slayers in the “Slumber Party Massacre” trilogy (1982, 1987, 1990).

The film only cost $20,000 (equal to about $98,000 today), but Ferrara was able to acquire quality no-name actors for his weekend project. In other words, the key peripheral actors are convincing in their roles despite what critics might say. I’m talking about the ones who play Carol, Pamela, Dalton Briggs, the landlord, Tony Coca-Cola and his girlfriends.

A couple years before Ferrara made this, Marvel’s Man-Thing featured Steve Gerber’s “Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man” in issue #12. I bring this up because “The Driller Killer” covers some of the same core issues, namely society driving an individual insane with pressures on every side, like bills, relationships, obnoxious neighbors, and making enough money or you’ll be out on the street. I’m sure Ferrara was influenced by it. 

On July 21, 1945, General George Patton predicted “I fear that perhaps in fifty years America will… become a land of corruption and degenerate morals."" This flick effectively shows this development and I’m sure the Soviets and China (et al.) used it to illustrate the downside of America & the West’s curious catering to Lefty madness.

It runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Union Square, Manhattan, which is just northeast of Greenwich Village and northwest of East Village. The rock club was located just northeast of Union Square.

...and reviewing it at almost 40, it hasn't changed at all, it's still the legend Chicago baseball fans grew up with, projected on the big screen, to sit back and take in as if you were watching the cautionary tail yourself.

And the thing is, it holds up to it. It holds up to the story of Shoeless Joe that inspired but the book (named after him) and the movie that would become Field of Dreams. It lives up to the stories that Grandpa and Dad told me from different points of view about where the guilt rested. It lives up to the stories of the darkest times during the greatest era in baseball history.

I'm writing this in 2018, the movie is set almost exactly a century ago and people are still telling stories of Joe Jackson, Ty Cobb (unfortunately slurring his name still), Babe Ruth, Buck Weaver, Honus Wagner,Cy Young, Lou Gehrig, and so many others. They became legends that Nolan Ryan could only dream of...and it was because the era was so important in the history of our national past time.

And Eight Men Out stands up to that legend and that mythological era where the gods played baseball.

13562,"""Forgotten Man"" meets flighty, rich heiress . . . and so begins one of classic cinema's funniest, most delightful, most intelligent comedies ever. William Powell as the hobo Godfrey hits all the right notes. Carole Lombard is terrific, if slightly over the top, as Irene Bullock, the ""uptown girl looking for a downtown man.""

What starts as an innocent city scavenger hunt becomes an unlikely romance when Irene Bullock brings home a gentlemanly bum named Godfrey and gets him hired as the new butler. Godfrey turns the household upside down (without really trying), much to the disapproval of Irene's stuffy parents (Eugene Pallette and Alice Brady). 

It is a shame that its style and intelligence is lost on much of today's audience, who have become so used to the usual dull, CGI-packed drivel that it is difficult for them to sit through a film like this. Brimming with wit and sophistication, this screwball comedy with a message is not to be missed.

If I was the sort of person who scrutinised every frame of my viewings looking for flaws, then I still wouldn't have issue here because My Man Godfrey has no cracks in its make up. It is perfect cinema from a golden age that we rarely see in this day and age. During a rich person's socialite scavenger hunt, air head Irene Bullock wins the contest to see who can find a forgotten man, a hobo, and showcase him at the toffs party. She falls for the charisma of down and out Godfrey Parke and gives him the job of Butler to the family Bullock. This of course bemuses the family, even more so when Godfrey turns out to be far more than they originally thought.

My Man Godfrey is one of those old classic comedies that has satire at its heart, for here the rich are firmly in the target sights of the makers, and it's they who come across as bumbling buffoons. Godfrey the hobo is the one with tact and grace, and it is he who is the one they all should take their markers from. Yet as important as the social message is, and it is, it's the brilliant comedy that shines bright and comes to the fore. This is an electric script benefiting from great work from all involved who put the words onto film.

William Powell is Godfrey, it's a perfect performance as he is never flustered as he delivers the funny lines with caustic impact. Carole Lombard is just precious as the dopey love sick Irene, making her interplay with Powell as comedy gold. My favourite of the bunch, though, is Eugene Palette as Alexander, the father of this bizarro family, every mannerism and every line out of his mouth had me in utter stitches. I must also mention that of the 6 Oscars the film was nominated for, I'm stunned there wasn't one for Gail Patrick as Cornelia, it's devilishly icy and weasel like, and she impacted hard on me to the point that I wanted to strangle her, job done, a great performance from her.

Truth is, they are all great, from the actors to the director, from the editor to the writer, My Man Godfrey is a truly brilliant film that easily entered my top 100 greatest films list today. 10/10",10.0

language (though I guess you can argue it isn’t shocking anymore.)

Anyway, this movie had plenty of laughs, a nice story, and a romance thrown in. The two leads dominate, of course, but the whole Bullock family is well cast. The only aspect that detracted from my enjoyment at all was the Carlo character. The silly matriarch of the family is  sponsoring him - A musician maybe?

13567,"If there's a slasher flick that came out during the slasher fever that took place in the 80s, that succeeded in not becoming another carbon copy of ""Friday the 13th"", that would be ""Sleepaway Camp"". The movie offers all the elements featured in the average slasher formula... and then some. We have the campsite, the oblivious adults, the group of stereotyped kids, the mysterious killer lurking around the place, an opening flashback showing a horrible tragedy and a lot of dead bodies piling up. 

In ""Sleepaway Camp"", the story begins with a family that is struck by a horrible accident, in which the father and one of the children die. Little Angela, the sole survivor of the gruesome event, is sent to live with her bizarre aunt Martha and her protective and loving (albeit cranky) cousin, Ricky, who is about her age. 

Many years later, we see Angela and Ricky as teenagers, heading up to a campsite during the summer, much to the girl's dismay, whose (almost pathological) shyness makes it really difficult for her to socialize. As soon as they arrive, Angela becomes the target of all the cruel jokes and pranks one could imagine, which is something that doesn't sit too well with her hotheaded cousin, Ricky. As one may be able to assume, the mean adults and kids begin to suffer and die one by one, at the hands of a mysterious figure that lurks around the place (well, that's original). Could the small and frail Angela have something to do with all this? Is her cousin, Ricky, more protective than it appears to be? While the owner of the campsite tries to find out what the heck is going on (while endangering the kids, of course), the meanies continue to suffer gruesome deaths, until a final revelation leaves everyone shocked beyond belief. Yes, Angela was the one who murdered everyone, except... Angela is actually Peter, who was forced to live as a girl, because her Aunt Martha didn't want another boy in the family. Yikes!

Yes, the plot twist is genius and it left me completely stunned when I first saw this movie as a teenager, so I won't play down the final revelation because it was, in fact, one of the most iconic endings in a horror flick and for a good reason. Now, another reason why I found ""Sleepaway Camp"" to be so disturbing is because it provides a subtext in which the youngsters are hopeless victims in a world ran by miserable adults. Most of the adults in this movie appear to be sick, lascivious, greedy and even plain evil, always taking advantage of children and teenagers in order to achieve personal satisfaction or gains. The kids are seen as objects used by these corrupt and perverted adults, who are only interested in their own satisfaction. Intentionally or not, Robert Hiltzik, who both wrote and directed the film, gives us a really dark take on reality, by showing the way adults relate to children and teenagers, since the adult characters combined are probably more terrifying than the deranged individual behind the killings. As a matter of fact, this aspect of the film is somewhat depressing, as it is closer to reality than one would think and probably not something one expects to see in a slasher flick that, presumably, doesn't intend to give a message. This aspect of the story is plain sickening and it's one of the main reasons why ""Sleepaway Camp"" sort of stayed with me over the years and I find it so revolting. First of all, we have Aunt Martha (played by Desiree Gould), a woman who forces a young boy, who has recently lost his family, to change gender, just because... she already has a boy in the family and doesn't want another one! That's right, my friends, crazy Aunt Martha didn't hesitate to ruin a child's life, just because she thought it would be fun to have a girl in the family (perfectly normal, huh?). 
Then, we have Artie, the cook... ugh, this is perhaps one of the most disgusting supporting characters I have seen in a horror flick. Artie is a perverted man, presumably in his thirties, who lusts after kids and who doesn't even bother hiding his sickening proclivities among his peers. As a matter of fact, as soon as the kids arrive to the campsite, god-awful Artie reveals how he wants to get his hands on the poor and helpless kids and, when one of his co-workers try to talk some sense into him, by explaining him that the kids are too young to even understand about sex, Artie claims that “There is no such thing as being too young"". As if this wasn't disgusting enough, this revelation doesn't cause any outrage among the other adults who work at the campsite, who, as a matter of fact, laugh at what Artie says. As it is foreshadowed by Artie himself, he later tries to take advantage of our poor innocent Angela and when he is caught in the act before anything happens, he threatens Ricky. Of course, none of this would have been possible if it wasn't for the complicity of his co-workers who remain silent and even find him humorous. 
Another character that is nominated in the category of ""Rotten adults who deserve to be eaten alive by pigeons"" is Mel (played by Mike Kellin), the owner of the campsite. Mel is a greedy old bastard who, even though he soon realizes that the kids are in danger because there's a killer on the lose, refuses to send them home, because he doesn't want to lose money. This results in the death of many more kids, obviously (bullies, yes, but they didn't deserve such a gruesome fate, that's for sure). Of course, Mel not only gets people killed as a result of his own greediness; he also beats up a teenage boy, simply because he assumes that he is behind all the killings. Oh, he also smokes cigars next to the kids (but it was the 80s, so that may not be entirely his fault). Last, but not least, we have Meg... okay, Meg appears to be around 18, so she doesn't qualify as an adult entirely, but she's, in fact, one of the camp counselors, who abuses her so-called power to bully our poor Angie (oh, and she also sleeps with Mel, the previously mentioned greedy old bastard... yikes!). 

So, yes, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is a disturbing film, but the way I see it, Angela is one of the many elements that contribute to make it this way. In the end, one could argue that Angela is, to a certain extent, a victim as well (don't crap your pants, I'm not justifying her actions!).

Of course, this is a slasher from the 80s that was filmed with a very limited budget, so, even though the film mostly manages to stay on the ""serious"" side, the unintended hilarity finds a way to make an entrance. The campiness (no pun intended, but I love it, anyway) mostly comes from the over the top acting that, from time to time, feels more like a John Waters flick, rather than a serious horror flick. Besides this, some of the characters are so ridiculous and bizarre that, even during a serious and disturbing film, I found myself laughing. The scene where old Mel finds his teenage sweetheart's dead body is comedy gold... seriously, I dare you not to laugh at this ridiculous acting.

Over the last years, ""Sleepaway Camp"" has gotten some negative attention from certain people who accused the script of being trans-phobic, because it depicts an allegedly transgender individual as deranged, which is something that I strongly disagree with. First of all, Angela is not transsexual, because she is actually forced to live as a girl by her crazy aunt Martha, and it is not established that Peter ever showed signs of being a transgender child, so we could actually argue if Angela should be called Peter and treated as a male, instead. But, assuming for a second that Angela was, in fact, a male-to-female transgender individual, and her gender wasn't arbitrarily imposed by her aunt... why should we assume that her sexual condition had anything to do with the fact that she ended up being a deranged killer? Why can't we simply assume that she turns out to be a killer as a result of a very traumatic childhood and the fact that she was bullied during her entire life? 

Controversy aside, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is a film that became a cult classic for valid reasons and gave us one of the most memorable endings.",8.0
13567,"***Adolescents at a summer camp in upstate New York… with a killer on the loose***

On the surface “Sleepaway Camp” (1983) is a clone of the first two “Friday the 13th” movies (1980/1981) mixed with elements of “Meatballs” (1979), but with more edge. Like the first “Friday the 13th,” the killer is a mystery until the end. Like “Meatballs,” the youths at the camp are adolescents, including pubescents. Kids of this ilk didn’t manifest in the Friday the 13th franchise until Part VI (1986) and, even then, they weren’t the focus.

Unfortunately, the production values are subpar compared to the above films. If you take out the cussing and slayings, this is of the TV movie variety; and I’m being nice. There’s also some overt camp (no pun intended), like Ricky’s mother. 

Still, you can’t beat the early 80’s ambiance and the styles are amusing, especially the short shorts worn by guys. Unlike most of the “Friday” flicks or “The Burning” (1981), the killer doesn’t wear a mask; and “Sleepaway Camp” gets extra points for a shockingly perverse revelation at the climax. There are several other gems, like Judy’s full black mane (Karen Fields), Meg’s curious attraction to the older curmudgeonly camp owner and Paul DeAngelo’s impressive fitness & laughable shorts. 

The film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes; and was shot in in Argyle, New York, near Summit Lake at a camp formerly named Camp Algonquin.

Sleepaway Camp is an American independent horror movie from filmmaker, Robert Hiltzik. Who wrote, directed, and produced the film. It introduces a very young Felissa Rose as Angela Baker. Alongside local actors Jonathan Tiersten, Karen Fields, and Christopher Collet. We even have a rare appearance from Robert Earl Jones, brother to James Earl Jones. And this movie marked the final film role for Mike Kellin as he would die of lung cancer in August of ‘83. It was released to US theaters on November 18th, 1983 and became a surprise hit.

Angela Baker and her cousin Ricky attend summer camp at Camp Arawak. Ricky had been coming for a while, but this was Angela's first time. Needless to say, it doesn't go very well. The camp is full of creeps, assholes and jerk-bags. And someone is running around trying to kill them all! This really doesn't help things for young Angela who just wants to be left alone.

Today we are looking at an iconic horror movie, Sleepaway Camp. A film that definitely made a mark and has an ending scene that will be burned into your memory for years to come. It's quintessential, in that it captures the time in style and fashion. It encompasses that summer camp feeling better than a lot of the other flicks in the same setting. Hell, it captures camp better than most Friday the 13th movies that are set at Camp Crystal Lake. This isn't afraid to go places other films fear to tread. It explores all sorts of themes from gender-roles to child molestation, while simultaneously injecting some entertaining camp comedy. The characters are all exaggerations with long strokes of realism. The dialogue can be hokey at some points but realistic at others. The fighting and bickering between campers is great. I’ve always felt that kids cursing really hit a stride during the mid-seventies through the eighties. And the language in this movie is on another level. I am all on-board for it.

Sleepaway Camp is an original and well-crafted slasher. Everyone that dies is very unlikeable and deserves what they get. The pedophile cook was my favorite. He's a real piece of shit that gets his comeuppance in such a satisfying fashion. And it's true that the ending is a finale that you will never forget. Believe that. Sleepaway Camp isn't going to be for everyone. It's going to be highly offensive to just about any parent or puritan. However, it has a lot of great qualities that make the film stand out far ahead of the competition. It fits into horror marathons perfectly and is a usual fixture during Halloween parties. And if you like this movie already then I would suggest Wet Hot American Summer and Friday the 13th. Both are classics from two different genres. Both fit around this movie perfectly.",7.0

Three girls & two guys break down in the hills north of Los Angeles and are helped by the genial owner of a defunct desert museum with a penchant for spooky masks & mannequins (Chuck Connors). 

“Tourist Trap” (1979) combines elements of several previous horror flicks, like “Psycho” (1960), the desert museum opening of “Gargoyles” (1972), “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974), the telekinesis of “Carrie” (1976) and the creepy mannequins of several 70’s movies/shows, including Kolchak: The Night Stalker (“The Trevi Collection”). It was made by the creator of “Puppetmaster” (1989) and heavily influenced “House of Wax” (2005); it even had an impact on the imminent “Friday the 13th” flicks.  

If you like those movies you’ll like this one. It’s not as good as the better ones, and is overrated in some circles, but it’s solid for a late 70’s horror flick in the rural slasher mode. The highlights are Connor’s sympathetic portrayal, the rural locations, the sets/props and, especially, the female cast, featuring Robin Sherwood (Eileen), Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Jocelyn Jones (Molly).

13570,"A (PG)-rated slasher film that has been on my radar for decades, ""Tourist Trap"" is both creepy and ridiculous.

Mr. Slauson (Chuck Connors) is a kindly old gentleman living at his all-but-abandoned wax museum and tourist attraction, ""Slauson's Lost Oasis."" A new highway has rerouted all of his business away, save the occasional car that conveniently breaks down. After the opening murder of Woody (Keith McDermott) at an abandoned gas station on the new highway, Woody's friends Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Ness), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), and Becky (Tanya Roberts) conveniently break down in Jerry's hideous car at Slauson's oasis. Slauson loves the company, warning the group not to stray from the museum after dark, and definitely stay away from the big house on the hill. Victims being victims, they start wandering off one by one- stalked by a masked killer, and experiencing what appears to be paranormal activity around the museum and house.

The old VHS copy of this film was a mainstay at video stores across the country. It was also MPAA rated (PG), a rating that stunned the filmmakers themselves, and probably a reason Teenage Me never bothered with it. Connors, past his ""The Rifleman"" prime, turns in a sincere and sympathetic performance as Slauson. He played stoic and tough in his best known role but his output after the show ended was spotty and disappointing. The small cast goes through the routine in a film that came out a year after ""Halloween"" and a year before ""Friday the 13th""; there are a few slasher film tropes, but also some telegraphed plot points that are often silly. Roberts stands out in a sexy early role, and the behind-the-scenes trivia and stories from director/co-writer Schmoeller and others are often more interesting than the actual film. However...

The opening murder of Woody, and the scenes involving the wax mannequins, are often terrifying. There is something about the vacant expressions on the figures suddenly springing to life, and intercut with actual humans, that gave me the creeps (thanks to future director Ted Nicolaou's editing). The killer often wears a mask of plaster and a wig, looking like Leatherface from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and the figure is quite a presence onscreen. Pino Donaggio's bizarre musical score adds to the weird events, the opening titles theme sounds like it was written for a comedy before his screeching strings invade the viewers' ears during the film. I've had the scary movie poster of this film burned into my memory since I was in elementary school.

I'm glad I finally got ""Tourist Trap"" checked off my ""I should really see this someday"" list- a middling but notable horror film that made me miss watching Connors and Roberts onscreen.

From the middle tier of what we know as being Neo-Noir, Twisted is a frustrating experience. Right off the bat the cast list boasts weighty worth, giving us the promise of a dramatic thriller, filmed on location in Frisco, with misty lenses, lamp lights, waterside moods etc, it's set up a treat. As is the premise...

Ashley Judd stars as a newly promoted hot-shot police detective, who in quality noir traditions has a whole heap of problems going on. Her family back story is shattering, she herself is heavily reliant on alcohol and she likes casual sex with strangers, strangers who start turning up dead, the kicker of which sees her basically investigating herself as a the prime suspect! Unfortunately with everything in place the pic never shifts out of first gear. The red herrings stack up, but nothing with any real conviction, and the whole premise starts to get monotonous, worse still the big reveal really isn't a surprise. There was a raft of these type of films in the 80s and 90s that were done much better, and on completion of viewing this effort one hankers for those pics - not to mention for the film noir of old!

Ashley Judd always frustrates, one can see a very good actress in her body of work, but she's more often than not starring in so so thrillers. It can possibly argued that her co-star Andy Garcia is a great actor who hasn't reached the heights he should have, the days of The Untouchables and Godfather III seeming to be fleeting glimpses of talent. Here he gets a thankless role that's poorly written, while both Samuel L. Jackson and David Strathairn add nice touches but aren't asked to extend themselves. Directed by Phillip Kaufman who as with Rising Sun, here also looks out of his comfort zone with the genre.

This is the first movie where I felt the need to call child protective services and put all the adult actors involved on a watch list.

I'm sorry if this movie is supposed to be funny, but it's an awful story about awful subject matter, and none of the jokes land.

Even Jason Biggs calls out the inspector's use habits throughout the movie, and these are the people we're supposed to get behind.  There is a difference between characters being silly and detrimental, and this movie is a great example of what crossing that line looks like.

The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is directed by Martin Ritt and adapted to screenplay by Paul Dehn and Guy Trosper from the novel of the same name written by John le Carré. It stars Richard Burton, Claire Bloom, Oskar Werner, Peter van Eyck, Sam Wanamaker, Rupert Davies and Cyril Cusack. Music is by Sol Kaplan and cinematography by Oswald Morris.

Disillusioned spy Alex Leamas (Burton) returns from Berlin and is required to ""come in from the cold"" and work in a stable everyday job environment. But this is just a small piece of a much bigger jigsaw… From start to finish this is a deliberate downer of a movie, the complete flipside to the spy adventures served up in other high energy filmic quarters. Filmed in coarse monochrome to set the mood, picture is often depressing, overtly talky and complex in its characterisations and narrative bent. However, those things are not hindrances, for this is undeniably adult stuff, oozing with intelligence and intricacies for the mature film fan, a clinically spun web of pawns, manipulations and distrustful men. The Cold War backdrop is marked as deathly cold, where the grey weather is only matched by the colourless complexion of Burton's depressed spy. As the twists rack up and the tension noose is tightened, Ritt and his cast of excellent performers are only interested in keeping it real, right up to, and including, the devastating finale.

Not one to turn to when in need of a pick-me-up, or in fact a film you want to watch perennially, but certainly it's a piece of work that serves to remind us that intense well written and performed cinema is always available to view when the mood fits. 8/10",8.0

In the early ’60s, an alcoholic British intelligence agent (Richard Burton) is sent behind the Iron Curtain to East Germany disguised as a defector, but intending to spread disinformation. 

Based on the 1963 novel by John le Carré, ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" (1965) is a realistic spy drama and NOT an action thriller in the mold of James Bond. It’s similar to another flick based on a le Carré book, “The Russian House” (1990), which ironically starred Sean Connery. Both movies are dialogue-driven and their depiction of intelligence work is decidedly mundane, static and cynical, which isn’t to say they’re not worth checking out for those interested. The tone is similar to “36 Hours” with James Garner from the year prior.

Burton locked horns a bit with the director and the tense atmosphere on set was heightened by the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, Burton’s wife, likely due to costar Claire Bloom’s romantic history with Richard. Claire plays the librarian, Nan Perry.

The movie runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot in Ireland’s Ardmore Studios and England's Shepperton Studios with exterior scenes done in Dublin; for instance, Smithfield, Dublin, was used as the location for the Berlin checkpoint at the opening.

13580,"There's an authenticity about the performance from Richard Burton in this cold war thriller that, alongside some well paced direction from Martin Ritt really helps it hit home. His character (""Leamas"") is assigned one final task, to deal with the duplicitous Peter van Eyck (""Mundt"") who appears to be systematically removing the West's reliable sources of information. What follows is a far more psychological cat-and-mouse game as he gets apprehended, and has to play a very dangerous game balancing the needs of his mission with his own survival instincts - all of this without much clue as to whom he can really trust and against a backdrop of thinly veiled prejudices. John le Carré's books were always packed with detail - and that detail carries well into this film, it offers a richness to the proceedings that ensures we are drawn into the plot like a mouse after the cheese. Claire Bloom adds a diversion to the intensity - but in a sophisticated fashion - maybe she's just innocent, or could she actually be involved?

Dead Of Night is brought to us courtesy of Ealing Studios, somewhat a veer from the normal output associated with that bastion of British cinema, it is none the less one of the finest films to have come from the place that gave us The Ladykillers, Kind Hearts And Coronets and The Man in The White Suit. I often wonder if Dead Of Night sometimes wrongly gets marked down by the modern audience on account of its familiarity with creepy anthology shows such as One Step Beyond and The Twilight Zone? Or because of the numerous other movies with the same horror format that followed this, the best of them?

There are five segments in Dead Of Night that are jointly directed by Alberto Cavalcanti (Went the Day Well?), Basil Dearden (Victim), Robert Hamer (Kind Hearts and Coronets) and Charles Crichton (The Lavender Hill Mob). In the cast we have Mervyn Johns, Googie Withers, Sally Ann Howes, Roland Culver, Frederick Valk and a stunning Michael Redgrave. The stories consist of ""The Hearse Driver,"" ""The Christmas Story,"" ""The Haunted Mirror,"" ""The Golfing Story"" and the chilling crowning glory that is ""The Ventriloquist Dummy"" (the latter being responsible for my fear of talking dummies even to this day).

In spite of my obvious love for this film (it ""is"" the greatest anthology spooker ever) I'm aware that it suffers from a variance of pace (the bane of anthology films), whilst the light relief in the form of ""The Golfing Story"" , whilst being a jolly bit of cinema, is in truth a segment that doesn't sit quite right. More so when you consider it precedes the film's acknowledged Dummy led high point. Yet dust off the terribly British cobwebs and you find a hugely influential picture in the pantheon of horror anthologies. A film backed up by two genuinely creepy episodes (RE: The Haunted Mirror as well as that damn Dummy one). Thankfully, as Ealing films have found a new audience on DVD, Dead Of Night has been subjected to worthy and complimentary re-appraisal. Especially in America, where confusion reigned back in the day as two segments were cut from the released picture (segment 4 Golf and segment 2 Christmas), I mean imagine trying to make sense of character continuity there!

13581,"Ever since I was a small child I have loathed ventriloquist's dummies. They put the fear of death into me - and I am fairly certain that seeing this film in the 1970s is to blame. It's a compendium of four stories told by guests at a farmhouse, and is all kicked off by Mervyn Johns (""Craig"") who has a recurring - and rather menacing - dream that predicts doom and gloom. Before he can finish his story, though, we hear from three of the others. One involves a married couple where the husband becomes drawn into the life on the other side of his mirror: a mirror that comes from a room with a grisly past. The second is a more light-hearted haunting mystery with Basil Bradford and Naunton Wayne before the third, featuring an effective Michael Redgrave, is the one with the ghastly puppet - and then it is all rounded off by Mervyn. Thing is - is any of it real? Is is prophetic? Well you have to get to the end, and even then... It is well written and editing together. The episodic nature of the stand-alone stories works well keeping them short and snappy and the swathe of character actors who pepper the whole hundred minutes are all well cast and deliver solidly as we build to quite a gripping - if short - denouement. Watch in the dark with a glass or two and the rain beating against the window and this is really quite effective!",7.0

Izzard has this cute way of being able to tap into subjects that we can all associate with. Remember those daft sayings? Those school trips? Standing in a petrol station queue at night time? Or the madness of supermarket shopping? He is also one of those comedians that can visually get you laughing out loud with his mimes as he brings to life the most ridiculous of stories. This remains a favourite stand up show of many, one of the best available on home format releases because it still works on repeat viewings, but the joy is only shortened by the knowledge that the bigger he got the more Izzard let his standards slip.

Indeed, as he won't stop wailing, she implores the ""Goblin King"" of lore (David Bowie) to take him forever! As good as his word, the child is gone and ""Jareth"" expects some gratitude from the girl. Of course, she realises that she can't be without the little brat and so implores him to return him. Well maybe, but only if she can find the way through the labyrinth that guards his castle - and she has only twenty-four hours! Luckily (or not) she encounters the goblin ""Hoggle"" whom she bribes to take her through - but he's not exactly trustworthy and that's what leads to an enjoyable series of adventures as they both have to face the perils of a maze that is full of weird and wonderful creatures - some friendly, some not so - as she races the clock to find the boy. Jim Henson has had a field day here with multiple beasties of all shapes and sizes coming alive on the big screen and coupling with a storyline that shouts ""Monty Python"" at us on more than one occasion - especially with the derring knight ""Sir Didymus"" and his cowardly (or just intelligent) steed ""Ambosius"" - who's really just a sheepdog! Luckily, they also encounter the mighty ""Ludo"" who is on good terms with boulders large and small - especially useful as they find themselves uncomfortably close to the 'Bog of Eternal Stench"" which bubbles and festers so you can almost smell it in the cinema. All the while, the manipulative ""Jareth"" is putting obstacles in her way as well as offering a couple of decent songs along the way. Bowie doesn't actually feature that often, here, but when he does he brings a mischievous charm to the proceedings (even if he doesn't look that comfortable in his hoes!). The visuals are great fun, mixing the costumed with the manufactured skilfully and energetically and though I don't suppose there's really any jeopardy at all, the film has something akin to the ""Wizard of Oz"" in it's storytelling.

It’s got to be something self-sustaining as they are going to be down there for a couple of centuries. They do provide exit instructions, but over time they get lost and so nobody knows that maybe it’s time to resurface. Now, though, the engineering is starting to give up the ghost and that means power and food are becoming rationed. The mayor (Bill Murray) is hopelessly out of his depth/obsessed with his own position and the chief electrician “Sul” (Martin Landau) is running out of ideas so it falls to the unlikely pairing of youngsters “Lina” (Saoirse Ronan) and “Doon” (Harry Treadaway) to rekindle the population’s appetite to get some fresh air. Luckily, she has a box left to her by her grandmother and as their jobs involve them clambering around the city’s gubbins, they can begin to explore in earnest. This isn’t something they can advertise - the mayor and his thugs will not brook any disenchantment in their city, even if the lights are all about to go out. Now having to fight a rearguard action too, can they discover a way out - and even if they do, is there anything left? I liked the creative style of this film and the fantasy is well explored and unravelled by the engaging partnership of Treadaway and Ronan amidst a city of colourful visual effects. Murray hams up nicely and there’s just the hint of menace from the Dickensianly monikered “Barton Snode” (Toby Jones) to keep the adventure moving along quickly for a ninety minutes of passages, pipe works and grand scale machinery.

In this production, which I hated, we still had a relatively capable story that helped to understand things, and that served as a framework for a ton of jokes and the constant glorification of drug use, especially marijuana. In this film there is no story to tell: we have the jokes, which are even more idiotic, the kind that don't make us laugh but think “how was this possible”, and we continue, invariably, to have drugs, in quantities that would make the Colombian cartels richer than most countries in the world.

The animation is superb with just the right amount of music that doesn't overwhelm the storyline but does give us the memorable song of Cruella Deville.

The film is a delightful experience from start to finish, a complete classic that has been a box office success and is one of Walt Disney's triumphs.

Teenage films are not exactly my “cup of tea”, but I confess that this little comic film pleased me: after being abandoned by his girlfriend who, deep down, didn't like him and was just trying to be the girlfriend of the most popular boy in the neighborhood, a young man decides to die. After some half-hearted and half-hearted attempts, he ends up turning the situation around in a surprising way.

It's a film that has the advantage of being funny, although it's still as stupid as any other teen film. They treat that snowy hill as if it were a Himalayan peak – they even gave it a name alluding to a real mountain in this range – and good skiing seems to be an obsession for the locals. It's the most absurd thing in the film, at least for me. We also have a bizarre and disgusting family that lives close to the protagonist and that I wouldn't want near my house: besides looking like a beautiful group of idiots, I don't know if those people take baths. There are still some additional oddities, but I won't say much about them... it's better to see.

It’s based on writer/director Robert Benton’s experiences growing up in the Waxahachie area, which is 30 minutes south of Dallas.

13685,"It's always staggering to me that _Bottle Rocket_ is almost universally considered one of Wes Anderson's worst movies. Seeing the sub-70% rating on this website nearly broke my heart. And since there were no reviews of the film, I decided it was my duty as a _Bottle Rocket_ stan to make a feeble attempt at evangelizing on its behalf.

People complain about how twee and pretentious Anderson's movies come across. Yet, somehow, as one of his movies that largely sidesteps those pitfalls, Bottle Rocket usually gets shit on the most. Part of the ""problem"" is that there's a subtlety to the humor and the storytelling that is unmatched in Anderson's filmography. It's not as ""mainstream quirky"" as a _Moonrise Kingdom_, nor does it have the flashiness (relatively speaking) of a _Rushmore_ or a _Life Aquatic_. It's much more than that -- to me, at least.

It's a very low-stakes film, something which I always appreciate in my fiction. It's just a bunch of morons who want to be criminals. Why? Because they're morons and they have names like Dignan and Applejack and it's funny. You want a compelling plot, go watch _The Royal Tenenbaums_. You want to laugh at Owen Wilson dressing up in a banana-colored jumpsuit and riding around on a tiny motorcycle, _Bottle Rocket_'s ya boy.

Luke Wilson's Anthony is, ostensibly, the star of this film. His struggle with his vague mental illness really resonates with me because I, too, am nuts. Owen Wilson is the main attraction here, though. He brings a sort of low-key freneticism to Dignan that always makes me smile. Look at that little guy go. I honestly don't think Wes Anderson has ever written a better character, though I know that I'm, inexplicably, the only person in the world who thinks that.

I don't know what I can say to make people like this movie more. It's good! It's fun and cute and sweet! It's very Wes Anderson without being too Wes Anderson. You know? I would think more people would appreciate that. If this were made today, Timothee Chalamet would undoubtedly be cast as one of the two leads, so let's be glad it lives forever encased in 1996 carbonite.",10.0

Based on Dan Millman's hit 1980 book, ""Peaceful Warrior"" (2006) is reminiscent of ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" albeit with gymnastics substituting for martial arts.

It's a worthwhile movie but a dad too formulaic and just seems to lack the necessary mojo to pull it out its pedestrian plotting.

Although I enjoyed the constant stream of wisdom that flowed from Nick Nolte's character, ""Socrates,"" the film took a wrong turn with him almost immediately by implying that he had the power to instantaneously levitate 15 feet. From there it gets even weirder. I felt this took away from his character rather than make him more intriguing. Regardless, Nolte does a respectable job in the role and, again, I did enjoy his many gems of wisdom throughout. Some say his philosophies reflects a Buddhist mindset, but I saw Biblical Christianity. For instance:

* The stress on service and humility, i.e. servanthood.

* ""Putting out the trash,"" i.e. putting off the 'old man' (the flesh) and putting on the 'new' (the spirit).

* Random thoughts are not you but they can become you if you embrace them and allow them to control/lead you.

* Joy despite the mundane.

* Discerning the real spirit of others (in the compassionate sense, although sometimes for protection).

* Give to those who ask of you.

* Turning the cheek as one's initial response to antagonism (but, keep in mind, you only have two cheeks, facially speaking).

And much more. These are axioms, universal truths that are true regardless of one's lineage, culture or present belief system. It's this aspect and the character of Socrates that make the film worthwhile.

Other than that, though, the plot mechanics are just too obvious. The viewer's aware of the contrivances just as much as the peripheral actors, who struggle with the material because of it. But the main actors do a splendid job despite these negatives. Speaking of the actors, beauties Amy Smart and Agnes Bruckner are noticeably underused. (I watched the 'deleted scenes' and their screen-time was cut; the fools).

13697,"_**Thought-Provoking Drama with Characters You Care about**_

""Grand Canyon"" (1991) is essentially about the 'grand canyon' that exists between the races and the haves & have-nots in America. It starts out powerfully with a middle-aged lawyer named Mack (Kevin Kline) taking an unwise detour in L.A.; the situation turns threatening when a group of thugs harass him, but a tow truck driver comes to his aid (Danny Glover). Thus begins a relationship that positively impacts both of their lives and the those connected to them.

One subplot involves Mack's love/lust for women (like any red-blooded male). He and his wife (Mary McDonnell) are starting to experience the empty nest syndrome; he naturally veers toward an affair at work. There's an early scene where the potential ""other woman"" (Mary-Louise Parker) comes into his office and puts her hand on his. It's a simple yet potent scene. Is it wrong for Mack to have feelings for this woman? Should he risk destroying his marriage by pursuing a more intimate relationship? And, if he does commit adultery, can he still change his mind before it's too late? Will he?

That's just one subplot amongst many. Some reviewers feel there are TOO many stories going on. I suggest they stick to lighter fare.

Here’s a sampling of themes explored:

Miraculous life-saving encounters; white/black relations; the rich/working class/poor divide; homelessness. Why do kids join gangs/become hoodlums? The challenges of a nigh romance-less marriage; the drive to improve one's living standards. Does violence in film escalate violence or is it simply a reflection of society? Does a filmmaker have a moral responsibility to society? Life-changing experiences that aren't so life-changing after all. How many split seconds do you have to make a left turn in downtown traffic? What do you do after miraculously finding/saving an infant? Divine intervention; matchmaking, blind dates and finding Mr. or Ms. ""right”; the ripple-effect each person's actions have on others, revealing humanity's significance, which is contrasted by the idea that humanity is inconsequential compared to the Earth & Universe's timeless marvels, like the Grand Canyon itself.

The picture obviously bites off a lot, but is well able to chew it. It bespeaks of real life and doesn't come off contrived at all. Take for example the teen's driving lesson: He makes a serious mistake and then pulls over. After his father explains a few things he attempts to start the vehicle which is ALREADY running. We've all done that. Another example would be the filmmaker’s beautiful redhead girlfriend Vanessa (Sarah Trigger): She's calm, happy and pleasant one moment but then suddenly starts crying (obviously provoked by a statement). A rambling and uncomfortable emotional rant ensues. It's real. Another example would be Claire's reaction when her son asks if she and Mack are getting a divorce. Shocked, she replies, ""Why would you ask that?! Do we seem like a couple on the verge of divorce?"" She KNOWS that her son wouldn't ask such a question unless he sensed there were problems in the marriage on some instinctual level. These are just three minor examples off the top of my head.

I've heard some complain that there's no humor. Did we see the same movie? There's actually quite a bit of humor or, at least, amusing and light-hearted moments. (How could there not be with Steve Martin in the cast?). Even though the picture is essentially a serious drama I busted out laughing, snickering or smiling on several occasions.

Scanning through the reviews you'll note that ""Grand Canyon"" is a love it or hate it piece. I love it. The acting is, for the most part, great and you really come to care for the characters; you care about the outcome of each of the story lines. One reviewer commented that ""Grand Canyon"" is a depressing film; he couldn't be more wrong. Yes, there are some disconcerting story elements, but watch it till the end. Other reviewers criticize Steve Martin playing a filmmaker with a beard. These people need to get a life; Martin was perfect for the role.

I appreciate that “Grand Canyon"" respects the intelligence of the viewer; it's not dumbed-down, nor is everything spelled out. Some things you have to read in-between-the-lines, others are left to the imagination. It also provokes you to ponder the numerous issues it addresses for days afterward. Few movies have this effect. In fact, there's so much to ""Grand Canyon"" that you'll get something new from the picture with each viewing.

When the movie was originally released a New York Times critic it as the worst movie ever made (Why sure!). First of all, who cares what some moron from the NY Times says? The very fact that he writes for The Times tells you that his artistic judgment shouldn't be taken too seriously.

Also, most critics hailed 2004's ""Crash"" as a masterpiece but it obviously borrowed much from ""Grand Canyon”; the difference is that the latter is the better film. Although ""Crash"" has its merits ""Grand Canyon"" is more entertaining and actually inspiring rather than downbeat.

""Grand Canyon"" is a film of the most eminent order; a masterpiece.

It runs 2 hours, 14 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

I had never heard of <em>'Home on the Range'</em> until recently, given I felt consistently entertained by it I'm surprised it hadn't reached my horizons before. It's nothing deep or massively meaningful, but it's good family fun that the younger audiences will probably largely like. It doesn't feel Disney-esque, I will say that.

There are a number of instantly noticeable voices in the cast. Steve Buscemi, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jennifer Tilly and Judi Dench all appear as Wesley, Buck, Grace and Mrs. Caloway respectively. Away from them, Randy Quaid does well as Alameda Slim, while Sam Levine is mildly amusing as the Willie Brothers.

13701,"Ten years after the success of ""Amadeus""; Hollywood decided to offer us a biopic of this giant of 19th century music who helped set up Vienna as the Mecca of classical music at the time. A truly multi-talented Gary Oldman is on good form as Bernard Rose guides us through the life, and fairly frequent loves, of this genius. His flaws are writ large from the beginning; his, at times, quite brutal upbringing and his womanising certainly didn't make him the nicest of men; and as his deafness takes over his character becomes more irascible and unpredictable. The story is presented as a retrospective, starting at his funeral, and is largely described through the perspective of his friend Anton Schindler (a considered effort from Jeroen Krabbé) and we see how his nature could vacillate from kindly, cruel, passionate and loving to selfish and vile. There are strong supporting contributions from Isabella Rossellini and Johanna Reiss that help keep this film focused and engaging. There are also ample opportunities to hear some of his music played, quite possibly, in a venue he would have himself attended. The attention to detail is superb: costumes, sets and locations all looking excellent. The dialogue is sparing, but it's what they all do with it - especially Gary Oldman - that helps make this film stand out. Two hours just flew by, and if you are fan of the music and interested in the man - then this is a good watch.",7.0
13703,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Marek Kanievska, ""Less than Zero"" is a drama about a trio of rich 18 year-olds from Los Angeles. After graduation, one goes off to college (Andrew McCarthy), but returns for Christmas break wherein he finds his ex-girlfriend (Jami Gertz) and, especially, his buddy (Robert Downey Jr.) struggling with drug addiction in the Beverly Hills fast lane. James Spader plays a smug high society dealer. 
 
This is the furthest thing from typical 80’s youth flicks, like “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” “The Karate Kid,” “Valley Girl,” “Footloose” and “Can’t Buy Me Love” (where there’s, admittedly, a lot of range). “Less than Zero” has the epic, artsy style of Francis Ford Coppola films like “The Outsiders” and “Rumble Fish” (both from 1983) meshed with the chic melancholy of “Poison Ivy” (1992). 

My main issue is that it takes too long to get absorbed into the characters and their story. The filmmaking is gorgeous, however, which is ironic because this is a really downbeat movie. Gertz is fine, but she never did anything for me, while McCarthy is serviceable as the main protagonist, yet rather bland in a goody-goody way. Both Downey Jr. and Spader, however, de-shine in their roles (in a good way). If you favor arty, glum movies you might like this better than me, but it’s nowhere near as effective as “Poison Ivy,” a similar artsy, gloomy flick.

13715,"The last twenty minutes of this rather enliven it, but otherwise it's rather dull story of ""Brad"" (Sean Penn) who is rather in awe of his criminal ""Dad Brad"" (Christopher Walken) and hopes to one day emulate what he sees as his glamorous lifestyle. One such day arrives when the father agrees to plan a robbery for his son to execute only things don't go to plan and just about everyone discovers just how vicious the older man can be when it comes to his own self-preservation. Most of this is really just an excuse for Penn to wander around shirtless showing off his pecs whilst a few variations of Madonna's ""Live to Tell"" serenade us from the sidelines. The two women who feature here - Mary Stuart Masterson's ""Terry"" and Millie Perkins's ""Julie"" make little impact on the Penn family beauty pageant (his brother Chris also features as his younger sibling ""Tommy"") and though Walken emanates just an hint of menace as the plot thickens, it's all just too little too late by the end when I really wasn't bothered about this repetitive tale of a dysfunctional family with testicles where their brains ought to be.

For a sequel, <em>'Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World'</em> is indeed a fine attempt. I like the story of Pocahontas visiting London and seeing a new place, though the new love story is pretty dull and forced.

Irene Bedard is again good, while Billy Zane comes in with a fair performance as John Rolfe; arguably better than Mel Gibson's John Smith. The latter is now voiced by Mel's brother, Donal, funnily enough.

The problem when films add another 'good' love interest is that you end up having to force the lead into one direction, most of the time without strong reasoning - that's exactly what happens here unfortunately.

That all meanders along offering little new or even interesting and way too many facial close ups. It's the musical performances - expertly staged, choreographed and produced that make this worth watching. Prince just exudes a chemistry, a sexuality and a swarthiness that makes it clear why the man was an huge international superstar.

Lithgow isn't the only positive cast, as Dudley Moore and David Huddleston do solid things too. It's interesting to see that Lithgow doesn't rate this, as well as the fact that it's apparently popular in the UK; though I, as a Englishman, had never heard about this before this year to be honest.

Luckily they have a sprinkling of magic dust to doctor the food of not just his own reindeers, but of a few others too and decades now pass uneventfully.

Perhaps ""Santa"" has some growing up to do, too?

Though largely suppressed by the overwhelming military force, the Boers did have success with guerrilla tactics that resulted in the pretty brutal skirmishes described here. A court martial has been constituted to investigate the activities of three Australian solders and to basically scapegoat them. Only the legal skills of the inexperienced lawyer ""Maj. Thomas"" (Jack Thompson) can hope to prevent the three from going to the gallows. What soon becomes clear is that the soldiers lead by ""Morant"" (Edward Woodward) were certainly no saints, and that the ghastliness of this war is writ pretty largely, but what it also identifies is the complicity of their otherwise ""civilised"" officers. It's got a solid cast, the dialogue is gritty and plausible, the cinematography presents us with the grand scale of the South African countryside and of the often rather subsistence existence of farmers and soldiers alike, and as the momentum builds, Australian director Bruce Beresford manages to sustain a fair degree of interest in the future of the accused and take quite a swipe at the colonial mentalities that prevailed at the time (and not just the British ones) too.

A young woman from Sydney (Kate Winslet) becomes a follower of a guru in Delhi, so her family hires a top deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel) to liberate her from the cult’s brainwashing, which is carried out at an isolated cabin in the Outback.

""Holy Smoke"" (1999) is similar to “The Piano” from six years prior (also starring Keitel), which isn’t surprising since it was made by the same writer/director. Both are adult-oriented drama/romances, but this one is set in the modern day and is just as much a quirky comedy.

There are numerous highlights, including the charisma of the two stars, Kate’s voluptuousness (she was 22 during shooting, almost 23), the breathtaking scenery, the humor in which every Australian is goofy or eccentric, the beauty of Sophie Lee (Yvonne), insights on male/female relationships and the power of a beautiful woman.

Unfortunately, I found the last act tedious; it needed reworked to make it more compelling. Also, are we to seriously believe that the woman from the first act, who swoons over a charismatic cult-leader in a patriarchal society, is the same one in the last act? _Why Sure!_

Lastly, the film flirts with interesting commentary on serious cult indoctrination, such as the Manson family, Koresh’s Branch Davidians and Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple, yet discards it for: Cult brainwashing, what cult brainwashing? I suppose the Campion sisters were shooting for amusing irony. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in Sydney, Australia, and 1000 miles west in Hawker, Finders Ranges (the Outback scenes), which is located in southeast South Australia. The Indian sequences were done in New Delhi and Pushkar in north-central India.

The Unborn has a better cast than a typical horror flick with Gary Oldman and Idris Elba, along with solid performances from Odette Annable and Meagan Good.

Some reviews complain about The Unborn's poor character development, but this is a horror movie. Horror isn't a genre known for its well-developed characters.

Most of them delivers quirky and fun characters, and some of them even gives us a bit to think about, like Tom Hardy's role, Handsome Bob, who is coming to terms with being gay.

The movie is fast-paced to begin with, but slows down a bit later on.

Ah yes, the good old disaster movie, a genre of film that continues unabated through the decades, this in spite of critical indifference. But the paying public still keep turning up in droves, even in this new technological age. Where once was models being destroyed, and paintings forming elegant backdrops, now is whizz bangery that costs a fortune. Still great fun, though, which is why something like Knowing exists and has many fans. 

It's a splendid piece of sci-fi hokum pulsing with supernatural overtones, a gentle creeper unravelling the mystery in layers until the final countdown begins. The science is obviously dubious (it's a movie folks) and the air of pessimism that hovers consistently over proceedings (not only is the world in trouble, but all the protags have miserable issues as well), may be too much for some. However, Cage is as committed as ever, Proyas yet again proves himself a beautiful visualist, while the scenes of carnage are truly harrowing and unforgettable.

13811,"""Knowing"" (2009) is one of those movies that grabs your attention with an intriguing concept and keeps you hooked with its mystery and suspense. The plot, while ambitious and unique, sometimes feels like it bites off more than it can chew, especially with character depth and emotional weight. The film builds tension effectively but doesn't always make you feel invested in the people involved. Nicolas Cage delivers a solid performance, carrying the film with his usual mix of intensity and brooding energy. The directing by Alex Proyas is well-executed, creating an eerie, unsettling atmosphere that keeps things engaging. Visually, the cinematography does a great job of amplifying the film's apocalyptic themes, with some standout sequences that are both haunting and well-shot. The CGI, though not perfect, holds up for the most part.

The script has its strong moments, especially in its pacing and mystery elements, but it leans heavily on exposition at times, which can make certain parts feel more like a lecture than organic dialogue. The score adds to the eerie and suspenseful tone, effectively building tension in key moments. While the film might not be a masterpiece, it is still an entertaining watch with an interesting premise, good directing, and some genuinely tense moments. If you go in without expecting deep character exploration and just want a gripping mystery with a bit of a sci-fi twist, it’s definitely worth a watch.",6.0
13812,"Due to the fact that it was filmed from reporter's cameraman perspective, I felt like I was dizzy (and I still am dizzy now) while watching this film. The plot is very simple but it could keep me watching it to the end. So, I'd say it's kind of watchable even if a lot of people would say it's not. 

P.S.​ I kind of find that the main character, Angela is so annoying. I even wanted her to die and turn into zombie-like thing. (No offence.) Although it didn't show clearly how it ended, but I deeply hope and take it that Angela didn't survive. It's so sad that they didn't show the end of Angela.",5.0
13813,"**_Survival in the woods during WW2_**

As Nazi forces sweep through Eastern Europe in 1941 the Bielski brothers (Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell) seek refuge in the deep forests on the border of Poland and Belorussia (Belarus). More and more desperate Jews join their ranks for common protection and to oppose the occupying Germans. How can they all survive in the woods during the next four years of war?

Released in 2008-2009, ""Defiance"" is a drama/war film that has a lot going for it: a story based on actual events, good actors, authentic locations (filmed in Lithuania, a mere 100 miles or so from the actual sites), effective cinematography and a quality score. I personally love survival-type films and ""Defiance"" fills the bill, although it's not great like, say, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992).

The filmmakers throw in all kinds of dynamic things to maintain the viewer's attention: Numerous gun battles, an airstrike and a tank, which are all faithful Hollywood-isms. It would've been better to simply focus on the characters and their gritty survival story. How about a deeper examination of individuals reduced to basic necessities? What about a study of people stripped of all civilized influences, struggling with the animalistic side of their psyche, as depicted in the excellent ""Sands of the Kalahari"" (1965)? How about the immaterial yet palpable bond of love which unites and gives life even in the worst possible conditions? There's some of this, of course, but I wanted it to go deeper, like in ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" (1965).

One thought-provoking scene concerns a man seeking to join the ever-growing group in the woods wherein he is asked what he does in order to determine how best to utilize his skills. He ponders it a moment and replies that he's ""an intellectual."" There's of course little use for an intellectual in such a forest community. The region was largely agrarian and so the peasant-types were skilled in at least one practical area as farmers, craftsmen or laborers. But what use was an ""intellectual""?

How many of us are intellectuals and would largely be useless in such a scenario? We'd learn new skills real quick, huh? So the picture works on a what-if level: How long will our present society endure as it is before many of us are forced to live primitively in the sticks? If that happens, I hope you're more than just ""an intellectual.""

""Defiance"" is worthwhile if the survival-in-the-woods plot piques your interest. It's superior to the similar ""Tears of the Sun"" (2003), but IMHO not quite as good as ""Hornet's Nest"" (1970) and ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" although it's not far off.

The movie runs 2 hours, 17 minutes.

13813,"Two Jewish brothers - ""Tuvia"" (Daniel Craig) and ""Zus"" (Liev Schreiber) are leading a ramshackle group of escapees from the Nazis into the depths of the Belorussian forest. With little food and weapons, their imperative is to try and build some sort of shelter to see them through the harsh winter whilst trying to find allies to help them survive. This is no mean feat, with hundreds of mouths to feed, and it sorely tests the faith of many and the resilience of their commander who is increasingly at odds with his more pro-active brother. It's ""Zus"" who finally decides to leave and join the approaching Red Army battalion and that leaves ""Tuvia"" and another brother ""Asael"" (Jamie Bell) with quite a challenge as sickness and starvation loom. This isn't a particularly well written drama, nor is Craig really that great either. What works here is the sense of desperation that Edward Zwick manage to present us with. The dense forest, the snow, the wind, the darkness and the wolves. The drudgery of these ordinary people reduced to living little better than animals facing a relentless foe that is bent on an irrational plan of slaughter. Tomas Arana does quite well, if sparingly, as the Soviet commander who is suspicious of his Jewish (traditionally non-combatant) cohort and who is also, clearly, a man who probably ought not to be trusted too far. Just to lighten the mood, the under-used Bell gets a little bit of love interest for when the meagre fires die down of a cold evening. In an environment where it really is live or die, the story touches on issues of collaboration and shows us another hugely effective method employed by their enemy to subdue - and keep subdued - a population ill-equipped to survive hand-to-mouth.

It's not really a ""gay"" film; it is a much broader analysis of a young man with neither the roots of his country, nor of a relationship to help him through his rather meaningless existence. His community is trying to straddle their need to honour their homeland traditions whilst adapting to the ""tolerances"" of their new home - brought to a head by some fairly grisly homophobic behaviour all round in the last twenty minutes or so. Demitriades is fine, as is Paul Capsis as his openly gay/transvestite cousin ""Johnny"" but the rest of the cast seem there to reinforce the stereotypes and therefore add little to any meaningful dialogue. To be honest, it could be a depiction of any immigrant culture in any country - and falls a bit flat as ""Ari"" seems ultimately rather deserving of his shallow existence...",6.0
13820,"It happens sometimes. People just explode. Natural causes.

Repo Man has become one of those films where even though it was savaged by many critics of the time (not Ebert, he loved it), was met with very poor box office as well, but now everyone seems to shout that they loved it back then, always have! It is the very definition of a ""cult movie"", a pic that went underground and found its audience, so much so it burst back above ground and today is still being discovered by an ever intrigued movie loving audience.

Repo Man was one of a kind, a film that refused to be pigeon holed, a true original. Story for what it's worth has Emilio Estevez as L.A. punk Otto Maddox who gets bluffed into a repo man job. Taken under the wing of Bud (Harry Dean Stanton), Otto gets to become a fully fledged repo man, taking on all the perks and dangers that come with the territory. But when a mysterious 1964 Chevy Malibu arrives on the patch, all bets seem to be off because everyone is either after it or being disintegrated by it!

The life of a repo man is always intense.

OK! Where to start? Offbeat, eccentric, punk, funky, funny, smart? Repo Man is all those things, it dares to be bold and challenging, its satirical edges slicing away at film genres and American societies. Director Alex Cox (how wonderful that such an American film is directed by a British guy) fills out this scuzzy part of L.A. with hippies, freaks, punks, aliens, scientist nutters, UFO nutters, effeminate coppers and the repo men themselves, a bunch of grizzled souls hardened by life's travails, but always with a quip, a smile and a gunshot at the ready.

The dialogue fizzes with cheeky derring-do, some lines even today still quotable and used in pubs and clubs across the continents. Robby Muller's cinematography has snap crackle and pop, as does the rocking soundtrack as Cox invites the likes of Iggy Pop, The Circle Jerks, Black Flag and The Plugz into his weird and wonderful world. Performances are bang on the dollar, Stanton the class act, Estevez superb, Tracey Walter proving what his fans already knew, that he's a legendary character actor.

From an opening involving a pair of smoking boots, to the glowing sci-fi nirvana finale, Repo Man kicks ass. One viewing is never enough, and for sure there are those who have seen it once and hate it to the point of refusing to ever watch it again. That's a shame, because repeat viewings are essential, because the more you watch the more Cox's deliriously cheeky movie makes sense. 9/10",9.0
13825,"Lazarus of Oregon.

The Lazarus Project is directed by John Patrick Glen, who also co-writes the screenplay with Evan Astrowsky. It stars Paul Walker, Linda Cardellini, Piper Perabo, Bob Gunton, Malcolm Goodwin and Tony Curran. Music is by Brian Tyler and cinematography by Jerzy Zielinski. 

A reformed criminal out on parole is beset by bad luck and finds himself sentenced to die by lethal injection. Strange then that once the lethal dose is administered, he wakes up working as a grounds-keeper at a psychiatric hospital… 

John Glen's first directing assignment is very much a mixed bag, but if landing in the DVD/Blu-ray players of the right audience it could well gain some momentum in the wake of Walker's untimely death. 

It's one of those films that operates at a funereal pace and thrives on other worldly atmosphere. After the introductions to the main character and his psychological make-up is out the way, pic shifts into a realm where we, as well as Walker's character, are never sure what is real or what is going on. Is he in some afterlife place? Is it all in his head? A dream? Drug induced? And etc. One of the smart things about the movie is that it binds the audience to the mystery by asking us to fill in the gaps with our own logic. While crucially the reveal comes at the right time so as to give us viewers the opportunity to re-evaluate the various quandaries that the piece has thrown up. 

For those who like films like Jacob's Ladder, Shutter Island, The Jacket et al, then this has to be at the very least of interest, to warrant the chance to sell itself to those particular sub-genre fans, besides which, it also shows a string to Walker's acting bow that was rarely tapped into by other directors. And it's beautifully shot by Zielinski too. Contemplative, intriguing and even chilling as regards the various themes it deals with, this Lazarus deserves its own second coming. 7/10",7.0

The story features an intriguing concept, but I can't say I was ever all that interested in it due to the way the film portrays it; which is a bit too episodic.

13836,"Race to Witch Mountain starts off with an interesting setup, but the plot doesn’t go much further than a straightforward chase. It feels like a movie made for a younger audience, with a lot of running, action, and not much depth. The directing is decent, keeping the pace fast, but it doesn’t leave much room for character development. The cinematography is serviceable, nothing too creative, though some action scenes are well-framed. The alien soldier design tries to be intimidating, but it comes off as inconsistent, one moment he’s unstoppable, the next he’s getting tossed around.

Dwayne Johnson does what he always does, playing the tough guy with either a serious or comedic expression and not much in between. AnnaSophia Robb stands out as the only character with real presence, but it’s a shame she didn’t get bigger roles after this. The script is predictable, filled with generic dialogue that doesn’t add much personality to the characters. The score does its job, keeping up the energy, but nothing stands out as memorable. The dog, surprisingly, ends up being one of the best parts of the movie. Overall, it’s watchable if you go in expecting a simple, fast-paced adventure, but it’s not something that sticks with you.",4.0

What let's this down rather, is that we know who did what to whom, we know the identity of the fifth columnist the police install in his gang, and thus almost all of the jeopardy is compromised right from the start.

Two brothers, David & Peter, kidnap Tracey, the daughter of local tough guy gangster Arnie, they hold her to ransom for the sum of £100,000. What they hadn't bargained into the equation is that Tracey is one tough feisty lady, and that a turn of events will lead them to something far more scary than big bad gangster Arnie.

This is the second feature from director Paul Andrew Williams, and bearing in mind that his debut effort was the highly lauded gritty drama London To Brighton, it's no surprise to find that some folk are a little bemused as to the genre splicing nature of The Cottage. The Cottage is far more in keeping with Christopher Smith's 2006 horror comedy, Severance, and certainly it wouldn't be out of place as a double bill with that criminally undervalued picture.

Very much a film of two halves, this picture is likely to prove a very divisive piece, and it will (has) only find an audience based on word of mouth alone. You will be hard pressed to find any sort of press marketing that will prepare you for the type of genre fusion film you are getting. Already, based on the comments written on this site thus far, you can see that some people were confused (or annoyed) by the tonal shift for the second half of the film. The first half sees poles apart brothers, David & Peter, swapping comedy dialogue as they whisk through a number of exchanges and circumstances with the marvellously volatile Tracey. While the second part of the picture hits you over the head with a quick switch to horror formula that has catering fulfilment for the gore junkies amongst us.

And this is where the problem lies with many, why didn't the film stay as a kidnap farce? Why didn't it set its stall out to be a horror film from the off? There is no denying that the films' high points come with the horror moments, but the film is first and foremost a comedy, from the first reel to the cheeky end of credits sequence it is what it is. As deliciously sick as the gore shift is, The Cottage never once takes its tongue out of its bloody cheek. It's obvious that Paul Andrew Williams is having fun here, and he is clearly hoping his audience will as well. View it as an all encompassing comedy/horror/thriller in that order and you wont go far wrong.

Andy Serkis plays David, the tough brother of the two, with Serkis doing a wonderful line in both visual and vocal comedy. This benefits Reece Shearsmith as Peter, a character so far under the thumb he can barely be seen. Shearsmith feeds off of Serkis to seal the comedy deal for this odd brotherly couple. British tabloid fave Jennifer Ellison plays Tracey, literally swearing for England to have the audience divided as to if they want her to survive or not! But it's a gutsy show from her and one hopes she ventures into this territory a bit more often. There is nothing new or fresh here, and this wont win any awards; even in its homeland of England, but it is FUN and it shows a director intent on making films from different genres. 8/10",8.0

For my money, it features one of the best songs from Sondheim's repertoire - ""Not While I'm Around"" which neatly brings me to the starring role, for me at any rate - the young Edward Sanders who plays ""Toby"" strongly and charmingly. Jamie Campbell Bower also delivers well amongst a supporting cast of solid British stage talent - a rather menacing Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall amongst them. It is dark and gritty, and stays fairly faithful to the theatrical performance that impresses not just with it's solid performances (perhaps not so much with Johnny Depp who comes across as eerily uncomfortable) but with the super costume and make-up effects, the lighting and, of course, a score that marries cleverly the threatening with the frequent (very black) humour. HBC is probably at her best here, I have rarely seen her more effective in a role and she can certainly hold the attention, if not so much perfect pitch, whilst having fun converting customers into pasties.

In 1897, a missionary widow (Lisa Pelikan) and two toddlers are stranded on a paradisal island in the South Pacific.

Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause play the two youths while Nana Coburn is also on hand.

“Return to the Blue Lagoon” (1991) is the sequel to the 1980 hit movie, but bombed at the box office, likely because it’s basically a retread. I prefer this one for various reasons; including the entertaining last act and the simple fact that I favor Milla over Brooke Shields (the latter never did anything for me). Both movies were based on Henry De Vere Stacpoole’s trilogy, although this one deviates more than the first.

There are similarities to Edgar Rice Burroughs’ “Tarzan of the Apes,” which suggests that Burroughs was influenced by “The Blue Lagoon” since it debuted in 1908, four years before “Tarzan” (although Burroughs claims that his only inspiration was the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus). (Why Sure!).

This is a well done and realistic island drama/adventure/romance and doesn’t deserve its bad rap. If you like movies involving castaways, like “Mysterious Island” (1961), “Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan” (1984) and “Six Days Seven Nights” (1998), it’s a must. This one just lacks the fantasy or farcical elements and is more akin to “Crusoe” (1988) and “Lord of the Flies” (1990).

The second instalment of the acclaimed John Ford cavalry trilogy had a lot to live up to after Fort Apache (1948). So it may not be too controversial to state that ""Yellow Ribbon"" doesn't quite achieve the potential promise that Fort Apache's foundation building had provided. However, here is still a mighty Western of many joys. 

The lead theme here is the passing of time, of time and love lost, lest we forget indeed. These themes give the film a strong emotional heartbeat from which to work from - even if on proviso it's noted that elsewhere there is not much in the way of an adrenalin pumping action extravaganza. Accepting it as an affecting character piece is something of a requisite if you want to get the most out of the viewing experience, and of course simultaneously getting wrapped up in the gifted art of film making in the process. 

John Wayne gives a top notch performance in what is obviously one of the first out and out serious roles that Ford gave him. His ageing Captain Nathan Brittles requires him to put in a very fallible human type of performance, something that he achieves in spades. He's a believable leader who is ruing the calling of time on his career in the service. Yet even Wayne's affecting turn is trumped by some of the most gorgeous cinematography you could wish to see from the 1940s. 

Winton Hoch clashed with Ford on the shoot about various perfections (both parties equally to blame of course), but the final result is incredible. Witness a scene as Brittles visits his dead wife's grave, the backdrop is all purple and red, a storm is imminent, metaphorically and in reality. Has shooting in the desert ever been so colourfully lush? The locations are breath takingly brought to vivid life, Monument Valley in all its glory.

Picture leaves an indelible mark on the conscious for the art and performances (Joanne Dru, Ben Johnson, Victor McLaglen & Harry Carey Jr bring their ""A"" game), but temper that slightly for as a story it just about gets by for dramatic purpose. Yet of course John Ford knows his onions and structures it accordingly, bringing precision and a genuine love of the genre and the material to hand. 8/10",8.0

Death Defying Acts is directed by Gillian Armstrong and written by Tony Grisoni and Brian Ward. It stars Guy Pearce, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Timothy Spall and Saoirse Ronan. Music is by Cezary Skubiszewski and cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos.

Not a biopic of Harry Houdini, but an episode in his life, Death Defying Acts (a bum steer of a title) is lukewarm across the board. Story charts the years after the death of Houdini’s mother, where he travels to 1920s Edinburgh and falls in with Psychic Tricksters Mary (Jones) and Benji McGarvie (Ronan), a mother and daughter team who spy an opportunity to prise a cash reward offered by the great escapologist.

What is intended to be a searching examination of Houdini, his mental fragility, hang-ups, strengths and etc, just plays out as a romantic period piece lacking vim and vigour. Pearce works hard as Houdini but never gets to grasp the tormented angle of the man, while Jones is miscast and not even her pretty face can light up a dull performance. Ronan is sprightly enough and Spall shows some emotive verve as Houdini’s concerned manager. The moments of trickery perk things up a bit, but even then the makers think it’s wise to debunk the mysticism. The romanticism of the era, and that of Houdini’s place in it, is well crafted onto the screen, but the flatness and confused thematic threads elsewhere leave this well below average. 4/10",4.0

On January 30, 1945, the United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts, and Filipino guerrillas saved more than 500 POWs in the Japanese camp in the Philippines from certain death as the Japanese were ordered to ""liquidate"" all prisoners before evacuating in the face of MacArthur's advance. Benjamin Bratt, James Franco, Max Martini, Joseph Fiennes, Connie Nielsen and Marton Csokas star.

""The Great Raid"" was based on the books ""The Great Raid on Cabanatuan"" and ""Ghost Soldiers."" I've read the latter and it's interesting seeing the film for live-action visuals of what I saw in my head.

The rescue, along with the liberation of Camp O'Donnell the same day, allowed the POWs to share the truth about the Bataan and Corregidor atrocities. While the raid had no strategic value, as far as winning the war goes, it sparked a new wave of resolve in the war against Japan. Not to mention, it remains the most successful rescue mission in USA history.

Although the movie was shot in 2002, it was pulled from release schedule on several occasions before finally having a limited released in August, 2005, with little-to-no marketing. Was it any wonder it failed to garner an audience and box office success?

Be that as it may, this is a solid WW2 flick based on a true story. The prisoners of the camp are the survivors of the infamous 60-mile Bataan Death March of April, 1942. The movie's not politically correct in that it shows the truth of the brutal savagery of the Japanese military. The actual raid doesn't take place until the 95-minute mark, but it's worth the wait; the build-up is informational and keeps your attention.

While I wouldn't call it great, it's a well-done and informative war flick for those interested in the subject. It's even better if you've read either of the books on which it's based.

There is virtually none of the spontaneity - especially with the rumbustious dances - that the big screen offered and what we are left with, though colourful and cheery, just lacks... something! So frequently it is as if they are still performing to that seat in the centre of the Royal Circle - complete with the casual supporting cast with their delicate short steps and stage whispers in each other's ear. Gordon MacRae looks pristine, way too pristine, and Gloria Grahame a very pale imitation of Doris Day from 2 years earlier in ""Calamity Jane"". Charlotte Greenwood does a cracking job as the worldly ""Aunt Eller"" as does Eddie Albert as the improbably named ""Ali Hakim""; even Rod Steiger does genuinely carry off the role of the disgruntled ""Jud Fry"" but I'm afraid the whole just doesn't equal the sum of the parts - and with Rodgers & Hammerstein providing ""Oh, What a Beautiful Morning""; ""Surrey with a Fringe on Top"" ""I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say No"" & the eponymous title tune; that's a real shame...",6.0
13938,"With ""The Last Dragon"" it really depends on when you saw it. If you saw it as a child in the 80s, well, it's crazy good. It's Chinatown excellent. It's one of the most beloved movies of your childhood and it lingers into your adult years with a heavy dose of nostalgia.

Honestly though, if you are walking into it now...it's a bit dated and in the cheesiest possible way. But then, even in the 80s it was trying hard to be cheesy, just, unlike it's peers, some of the cheese didn't age well.

Fortunately though, it holds it's own in that little notch, the Black-Fu subgenre of blacksploitation, and it holds its own in the funnest possible way.

The Bad Guys are over-the-top and hysterically so. The hero is brilliantly naive and pulls off the wang chung with an ease that is convincing for a kung fu movie. It's choreographed extremely well for the budget, making the action believable and blends seamlessly into the humor and cheese.

If you watched it as a child in the 80s, it will remain on of your absolute favorite films. If you're seeing it for the first time, well, it's not exactly timeless, you won't love it as much, but there is still enough there to amuse you and keep you entertained, it's still worth the time to watch.",10.0

13945,"Weak “Conan the Barbarian” knockoff

In a distant fantastical past, the rightful heir of a conquered kingdom (Lee Horsley) returns to his homeland as the formidable leader of a mercenary band. He assists “Prince” Mikah (Simon MacCorkindale) and his cute sister (Kathleen Beller) to overthrow the evil king (Richard Lynch) and his former evil sorcerer (Richard Moll).

“The Sword and the Sorcerer” debuted two weeks before “Conan the Barbarian” in the spring of 1982 and it’s just a second-rate S&S adventure by comparison. It’s heroic fantasy with the tone of Star Wars, but without the blockbuster budget and in-depth characters. In light of the somewhat kiddie vibe I was surprised by the female top-nudity. “Conan” was heroic fantasy as well, but it lacked the Star Wars air, had more interesting characters, a compelling story and a mind-blowing score by Basil Poledouris. I’m surprised that BOTH movies raked in roughly the same amount domestically at the box office, almost $40 million.

Speaking of the story, the set-up in the first act is too convoluted to create any drive, although the opening on Tomb Island where the hideous Xusia is resurrected in the bowels of the earth is well done. Horsley is gallant and Beller is adorable, but the characters are paper thin. At just over an hour and a half, the tortuous story has no time to breathe and therefore fails to flesh-out the heroes or villains, like “Conan” did. That said, some of the characters are kinda memorable, like the spirited black warrior (whom I can’t discern from the cast list). While there are worthwhile bits throughout this movie they don’t amount to a quality S&S picture. “The Sword and the Sorcerer” is decidedly bush league.

The end credits claim that the sequel is “coming soon.” Actually, it didn’t surface until 28 years later under the title “Abelar: Tales of an Ancient Empire” (2010).

The film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Griffith Park, Los Angeles; Culver City; and Riverside).

Acting was so-so however the lead didn't have a whole lot of charisma and the fight scenes were fine but a few scenes were too dimly lit.

13945,"This actually benefits from having the germ of a decent story of dynastic skulduggery. The evil king ""Cromwell"" (Richard Lynch) has designs on the throne of the peaceable king ""Richard"" (Christopher Cary). To that end he awakens the lethal and demonic ""Xusia"" (Richard Moll) to destabilise ""Eh-Dan"" and make it ripe for the picking. Fortunately, young prince ""Talon"" (Lee Horsley) escapes this terror and flees leaving his elder sister ""Alana"" (Kathleen Beller) behind - a slave. He doesn't forget though, and trains hard, learning how to handle a triple-bladed sword that he plans to use as he returns to reclaim his inheritance and free his sibling. Needless to say, though, neither ""Xusia"" nor the usurper are going to be welcoming him with open arms! The visual effects are OK here and the drama keeps going fine at the beginning, but the quality of both acting and writing soon starts to drag the whole thing down into cheap and cheerful television movie-dom. The tousled Horsley is pretty amateur from the get-go and although Beller tries to inject a little feistiness into her character, the whole thing just lacks any sense of menace. Indeed, Moll is about as intimidating as yesterday's lettuce. It is little raunchier than many of the genre but in the end it's rather disappointing and eminently forgettable.",5.0
13945,"They made a sequel to this that was bucking for arthouse... and it was horrible.

This movie was self aware enough to know that they weren't making Chinatown. The dialogue was pretty fun and understood that it wasn't anywhere near a good film, so it could still be light hearted enough to throw in gags here and there in the script, to over-act when it suited the scene, to be fun for the sake of being fun.

It's a B sword and sorcery flick that knows how bad it is, and makes the best of it that sort of turned the film into a cult classic. It's a serious movie that has fun with itself, has fun with it's content, and because of that the viewer can sit back and be entertained.

13949,"You may well ask, why should you watch this particular version of Jane Austen's Persuasion? well, settle in and let me tell you. 

I think I own almost every filmed version of every Austen novel. I find different strengths and weaknesses in all of them, but I would not trash any of them the way people do some versions because they don't stay true enough to the books. I write novels myself in my spare time and - were I lucky enough (or good enough) to have any made into a film - I would not be offended if they were changed. Books and movies have different needs and ways of telling a story. That said, I really love this interpretation of Persuasion.

I greatly appreciate how British productions often don't automatically lunge for the most beautiful or most handsome actors and actresses for their lead roles, as American productions are apt to do. Sally Hawkins is by no means ugly, but she is almost homely in some of her scenes, such as when she is weeping. I read a criticism in a review of how the actors stare into the camera, but I think Sally is at her most masterful doing just that, looking right at us, such as in the very first scene, or the weeping scene I just mentioned. Her facial expression changes are sometimes dramatic and other times subtle but still very effective. I think all of the acting is wonderful here, from the effete snob father right down through to the many minor characters.

I do admit I was a bit mystified by one aspect of the ending. I will try not to give it away to those who may actually be deciding whether to watch it, but the book's ending is changed for the film, which as I said above, isn't a problem for me in itself. There are enough versions of Austen movies or mini-series out there that I am fine with each doing some interpreting. And in this version, they want to make the final scene more dramatic. That is fine. But what struck me as weird was that Anne follows a character out the front door just seconds behind him, but that person is nowhere to be seen on the street, and she goes off in pursuit. It wouldn't have taken much to have Anne be delayed leaving just long enough to make it realistic that there would be no sign of him when she steps outside. But I forgive them that oddity. Perhaps it was the result of an editing room dilemma. Also in that scene they show her walking from above, which makes for a strange angle. Since then I have seen that technique used more, so perhaps it is a new thing. 

The music by Martin Phipps is also wonderful, moody and rich. I am surprised that the soundtrack was not made available (the last time I checked). The closest I have come to finding it was, oddly enough, a CD called H2O by the Canadian nature CD producer Dan Gibson. It is similar to the main theme music of the movie, though obviously not the same thing.",9.0

13957,"Richard Attenborough has assembled a good cast for this nostalgic wartime drama. In a troubles-torn Belfast, the young Wilbur (Dylan Roberts) finds a ring in a burnt out aircraft left over from WWII. His search for the owner leads him to Shirley MacLaine's ""Ethel Ann"", and our story slowly reveals, via a mix of current and retrospective scenarios, just what happened when and to whom. The beginning is a bit disjointed, the chopping and changing of timeframes and characters happens too soon after the film starts without us having quite enough information to follow the story easily, but once that settles down and the role of Christopher Plummer (""Jack"") becomes clearer, this makes for an engaging story of loves lost and bravery. It also doesn't ignore the fact that bombs continued to fall in Belfast for some years after the end of the War too.

13965,"Pointless sequel.

I don't hate <em>'The Man from Snowy River II'</em>, but there's nothing I truly liked about it either. It spends the first 45 minutes dragging out the love squabble between Jim and Jessica, for no reason as it's blatantly obvious where it's all going - yet they decide to do a will they/wont they for a huge chunk of the film. Once that gets sorted, it does get a tad better. Still, the premise isn't that great at all.

Cast-wise it's OK, even with the sizeable absence of Kirk Douglas; who played a dual role in the original. Despite Douglas not reappearing, the character of Harrison does return - with Brian Dennehy. Should've killed him off instead to be honest, story would've felt more different and fresher in my opinion. Meanwhile, Tom Burlinson (Jim) and Sigrid Thornton (Jessica) are, again, decent.

Quite interesting that Disney decided to pick up the sequel.

13975,"A woman is found murdered in the swamp somewhere in the south. A brutal murder, quite possibly a serial killer. A policeman is investigating, and  while he does that, another body is found, but this one nothing but bones. This guy (a black guy) was killed 40 years ago, and the policeman suddenly remembers that he saw this murder happening when he was a kid. There doesn't seem to be any sort of connection between the murders, except the man investigating both of them.

Tommy Lee Jones plays the old cop who investigates the murders in the swamp. He is a man fighting his own demons, meaning mostly alcohol, but clearly the death of this black guy has also haunted him for 40 years. He wants justice to be served, but is not willing to do whatever it takes, at least not in the beginning.

This movie is not the most exciting crime movie out there. One thing that makes it stand out from most of them, though, is that it doesn't want to trick us. From the beginning, we know where the plot is going, we just need to follow it all the way to the end and see the ends being tied together. The story is ok, solid, but what really makes this thriller different is the characters and the pace. It is not afraid to slow down the pace and gives us a look into the people who live here, and those visiting. I especially liked the element introduced with Elrod Sykes and Kelly Drummond, two movie stars down here shooting a movie. By the way, it is Elrod who finds the old bones while taking a piss. The confrontations between a drunken Elrod and a sober Dave (the cop), are brilliant and really gives this movie a lot of heart.

I also want to mention the music in this movie. It is there, but doesn't overshadow the images and plot, and most importantly, it has a very unique rhythm, like a beating heart, that drives us forward together with Dave Robicheaux. You notice it, but you don't notice it, if you know what I mean. Brilliant.

_Last words... don't expect this movie to offer you gore and violence. Sure, people die, but you never actually see any sickly images. That's not the story it wants to tell, it wants to give you an insight into a man, a man that isn't so different from you and I._",7.5

A no-nonsense detective in the heart of Louisiana (Jones) tries to stay away from alcohol as he investigates the murder of a young prostitute, as well as a murder from the mid-60s of a black man in the swamp. John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard, Mary Steenburgen and Ned Beatty appear in secondary roles.

Based on the 1993 book, “In the Electric Mist” (2009) is a detective drama/thriller with a Southern Gothic milieu. Imagine “U.S. Marshals” if it were set in the Deep South, like “No Mercy,” ""Cape Fear"" or “The General’s Daughter.”  

The details of the book are absent so you have to put the pieces of the puzzle together, but I loved the bayou atmosphere even though some of the peripheral actors seem like they memorized their lines 15 minutes before their scenes were shot. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot New Iberia, Louisiana, which is 15 miles southeast of Lafayette and 130 miles west of New Orleans. Areas nearby were also used, including Catahoula, Albania Plantation in Jeanerette, St. Martinville and Charenton.

14002,"BARAKA is a 1993 film, shot by Ron Fricke in some 24 countries, that is a sort of documentary on three universal themes: 1) the grandeur of the natural world, from the peaks of Everest to low deserts, 2) the oneness of the human race illustrated by juxtaposing almost identical shots from vastly separated cultures, and 3) the desire for a connection with something transcendent. Shot in 70mm film, watching the Bluray on a projector or a large-screen television offers one of the most visually stunning cinematic experiences around. There is no dialogue or voiceover, no characters, but the enormous amount of footage is presented here in a way that gives BARAKA a gripping dramatic arc, and it's a sequence that, on repeated viewings, increasingly seems the one logical way in which all this could have been edited.

With unquenchable anthropological curiosity, Fricke identifies commonalities that link us all. A Japanese mafioso's tattoos, for example, are followed immediately by a shot of the same on an indigenous resident of Papua New Guinea. But it's not only exotic tribalism. A shot of affluent Japanese schoolgirls looking at the camera is mirrored later by an almost identical shot of low-caste girls in Calcutta. Nonetheless, don't expect a mushy call for tolerance; Fricke's editing indeed makes a convincing case for appreciating differences, but there is nuance.

Fricke's occasional use of footage from churches, mosques, temples, etc. is less an advocacy for belief in religion than an extension of the commonalities he identifies. Human beings have an urge for contemplation as solace among the complicated and sometimes senseless world around them, and they draw on inner sources of mercy to go against the cruelty that people show to their fellow man. The consequences of a world cut adrift from calm and compassion are shown during a heartbreaking sequence that ranges from Auschwitz and the Cambodian killing fields to homeless across the globe and teenage prostitutes in a Bangkok nightclub.

The footage is accompanied by an array of musical pieces which help to set the mood for each series of shots: minimalist loops form the soundtrack for scenes of industrial production, we hear harsh bagpipes as the camera tours the burning oil fields of Kuwait, and Dead Can Dance's ""The Host of Seraphim"" plays during an indictment of poverty worldwide. Some of musicians involved are rather New-Agey and would never have a place in my music listening, but when integrated into the film they are remarkably effective. The 5.1 surround sound excellently balances cinematic effect and faithfulness to the scenes portrayed.

I've watched BARAKA many times now, each time discovering many new things and always being moved, whether to pity (Calcutta garbage-pickers) or wonder (the unreal glittering hall of Shiraz's Shahcheragh mausoleum). I would certainly rank it among my favourite films. Will you like it? That's hard to say. BARAKA is my go-to Bluray when friends and family want to try out my fancy home theatre setup with HD projector and surround sound, and while some of them have been just as stunned as I am, others don't really care. Apparently many people, even those with a well-rounded education, don't have much curiosity for things outside their own everyday experience, and so Fricke's survey of world cultures doesn't resonate with them.

(Note that while Fricke created a 2011 follow-up called SAMSARA, I would recommend staying away from it, as it is less focused and only repeats BARAKA to diminishing effect.)",10.0

Demons (Demoni) is directed by Lamberto Bava and Bava co-writes the screenplay with Dario Argento, Dardano Sacchetti and Franco Ferrini.

A wonderfully nutty spiced Spaghetti Horror, plot has a group of people trapped in a Berlin movie theatre that suddenly comes under attack by ravenous demons.

It could reasonably be argued that Bava's movie has some cheeky narrative depth underneath the gloop and schlock, this is after all purposely set in a movie theatre and features a film that basically becomes real, sort of. But really it's a pic that's set up for like minded horror buffs to feast upon, to jump head first into its feverish horror comic book glee. 

The script is as poor as the dubbing is, with a roll call of cardboard cut out characters and loose end scenarios jettisoned in readiness for the next plasmatic explosive sequence. Yet the care free abandon of the gruesome killings on show, and the rapid pace of it all, ensures it's a fun packed ride.

Directed by Gene Kelly so you would expect the ensemble dance numbers to be top drawer, and the they are - synchronised to within an inch of their lives, but always looking natural and flowing enthusiastically. Jerry Herman certainly does the business with the lyrics - ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes""; ""It Takes a Woman"" and the Louis Armstrong assisted title song all make this a quickly paced and enjoyable romp through all things mischievous, Jewish and one that is at times almost bawdy. Matthau is a revelation - he really enters into the spirit of things and Michael Crawford (though never my favourite singer) demonstrates a nimble fleetness-of-foot that adds a charm to the proceedings too.

14033,"***Moving ending, but dull protagonist and meh mystery about life & death***

A tragedy drastically changes the lives of four Chicago college students when one of them dies. 

“Soul Survivors” (2001) is a haunting mystery/drama with horror/thriller elements. It has the tone & setting of “Urban Legend” (1998), but without the slasher aspect. It’s also reminiscent in some ways of “An American Werewolf in Paris” (1997), albeit obviously omitting the lycanthropes.

The production values are top-notch for the genre and era, but I found Melissa Sagemiller uninteresting as the protagonist. However, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, Eliza (No Booty) Dushku and Angela Featherstone are all interesting. 

The problem is that the story isn’t compelling enough, although the climax is revelatory and moving. Speaking of which, the movie’s a mystery concerning life & death issues. It brings to mind a cult film from the early 60s, but I can’t say its name because I don’t want to give anything away. While “Soul Survivors” recalls that flick, it’s different enough to stand on its own. So even if you go in knowing it shares plot elements with that particular film it won’t ruin your viewing experience.

While I don't enjoy the aspect of shoving an addiction (actually compulsion) story into a Nancy Drew story (as she has to stop sleuthing), and I don't enjoy the relocation aspect of a world they built so well so quickly, this movie has far more benefits than drawbacks.

Once we get past the awkward ""lying to your parents"" aspect of the story that usually gets attributed to drugs and alcohol, the actual ""sleuthing"" is really fun and present in a charming and light-hearted way.

The mystery itself is actually complex enough to keep you interested throughout the movie, and the characters are fun, if eccentric.  Having a ""world's clash"" aspect to the story seemed unnecessary, and that's the only real hang up this movie had.

Firstly the movie was supposed to be the opening of a potential franchise to revitalize the Nancy Drew brand, but instead of giving it a strong opening movie, they jumped right in as if there were already 3 movies and they had already jumped the shark a second time.  I had several young people ask me if ""Nancy Drew was a thing?"".  Because it was mistreated in the writing process, what should have been a great movie is only a good movie.

I really liked this though: Emma Roberts showed early that she was up to carrying a movie, and I love that Rachel Leigh Cook (""She's All that"") got involved as she was from a different novel based franchise (""The Babysitter's Club"") that also didn't take off.",7.0

Released in 2007, “Snow Angels” is a drama revolving around a handful of ordinary couples, young and older, in a Northeast hamlet at winter time (filmed in Nova Scotia).

Some criticize that the film is depressing but it's inaccurate to say the WHOLE movie is depressing. Nor does it leave the viewer in a totally depressed state. There's a lot of beauty and hope amidst the shadows and darkness. Plus it leaves you pondering many things, including the numerous real-life people the characters remind you of. One of the storylines is tragic and depressing, no doubt, but that's not the whole focus of the story (although it is the dominant focus). The picture is about romantic relationships in various stages and whether they're successful or not depending upon their responses to the inevitable crises & temptations of life:

Arthur and Lila's high school relationship is just budding and seems healthy and promising. 

Meanwhile Glenn and Annie's relationship has been devastated by Glenn's alcoholism and anger/obsession issues; Annie wants to move on but takes a foolish course of action. She's not only foolish, but also treacherous! Glenn is trying to recover from his personal demons, he even gets born-again, but for some reason he has a hard time getting over his ex and moving forward with life. His struggle between the positive and negative forces within us all is real. Both Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale are outstanding in their roles, Rockwell particularly so. In fact, I've hardly ever seen such a realistic and powerful performance. The viewer sees his sincere desire to improve his life but foolish and selfish temptations manifest when he's faced with rejection and tragedy. Will he take the wise or foolish path?

Elsewhere Nate and Barb's relationship hits its first major crisis: Nate is discovered to be unfaithful. Barb responds with fierce anger, at first, until a tragedy shows her true angelic nature. 

Arthur's parents separate but maybe there's still hope for their relationship and family. 

Glenn's parents are in the latter stage of a committed relationship, which seems to have been successful. 

Glenn's loving & loyal retriever is the anithesis of Annie, who treats Glenn with hostility and desires to move on in life, away from him; although this is understandable, the viewer can't help but empathize and root for Glenn in light of his sincere attempts to improve his life and reconcile with his ex. After all, he's genuine & humble, he loves his daughter (and vice versa) and he's not an unfaithful scumbag. Pay attention to the very last scene to discover the fate of Bomber.

Take note of the scene where one of the main characters takes down a painting of the cross and there's a kid's handprint on the wall accompanied by the word ""me.” This signifies the turn he's decided to make.

The film leaves the viewer with hope despite the foolish, tragic and criminal events — hope that love will triumph, a certain couple will stay together and a youthful couple will make wise decisions and overcome the potential pitfalls that destroy others. It could go either way. Yes, the young couple looks happy and natural together, but every couple is like that in the early years of their relationship. Although the movie shows someone’s hostility toward another, it’s revealed that the person in question used to help the other person focus on the positive side of life and the support was always comforting.

A young character is shown flirting with alcohol and pot; not all people get thrown off-track by flirting with such things, I know, but one main character obviously did. Will he?

Only time and wrong or right choices will answer these questions.

After seeing the film I read a story about a recent incident in Arizona that mirrors the main storyline in the film. It happens.

""Snow Angels"" is reality. Once seen, you'll never forget it. Some will treasure it. My only complaint is that sometimes the camera bobbles around too much, which smacks of amateurishness. I realize the director was trying to be hip or whatever but the camera should never draw attention to itself. Fads pass away while solid filmmaking endures.

The movie runs 1 hour, 47 minutes.

14055,"Sometimes it's not about knowing the right answer.

Starter for 10 is directed by Tom Vaughan and adapted to screenplay by David Nicholls from his own novel of the same name. It stars James McAvoy, Alice Eve, Rebecca Hall, Dominic Cooper, Benedict Cumberbatch, Catherine Tate and Elaine Tan. Music is by Blake Neely and cinematography by Ashley Rowe.

Set in 1985 England, working-class student Brian Jackson (McAvoy) navigates his first year at Bristol University - which lends him the opportunity to feature on his favourite ever TV Quiz Show - University Challenge.

I have never read the book so have no frame of reference there, thus the complaints from devotees of the written source are null and void to me. For I absolutely loved this film, a fresh and breezy coming of age comedy that's tinted with dramatic intelligence. How nice to have a pic of this genre ilk that's not built around trying to lose one's virginity, or standing up to bullies etc. For sure there's a whole load of angst on show, a bit of class distinction dichotomy, the perils of formative fumbling romances, and of course whimsy. Yet the framework of education, the thirst for knowledge and an understanding of the problems evident in the world at time of pic's setting, all make this a smarter than your average bear British rites of passage piece.

Cast are on splendid form to make the multidimensional characters work (each main character moves away from being mere caricatures). McAvoy is splendidly affable as Brian, who is still nursing the loss of his father years previously, and then has to watch as his mother (Tate) takes a lover - the local ice-cream man (John Henshaw). It's no easier at University, where he lusts after the blonde bomber (Eve) when in fact he obviously should cop on to the fact that the girl for him is bleeding heart socialist Rebecca Epstein (Hall) - but she isn't the quiz type! McAvoy has a good comedy way about him, gawkish but lovable and perfect when portraying Brian out of his depth in certain scenarios.

Of the others it's Cumberbatch who steals the show as Patrick Watts, an absolute toff, an upper class twit who has no comprehension of the working class system and the perils within that structure. He is burned by his miserable failure on University Challenge the previous year, his inadequacies and stubborness blinding him to the benefits that others around him can afford him. The facial expressions, the posh vocab speak and the need to be in charge are brought vividly to comic life by Cumberbatch. Eve smoulders as Alice, but deftly plays her vulnerabilities, Hall has her character down pat, while Cooper, Tate and James Corden leave favourable marks. As do Charles Dance and Lindsay Duncan in unforgettable scenes as Alice's parents.

The whole play is covered over with an 80s soundtrack, mixing student favourites with punky pop tunes, while the period detail for Brian's home life prior to going to University (Southend-On-Sea) has been given great nostalgic thought. A lot of the humour is sure to be too British for none UK folk, more so those not familiar with what the mid 1980s were like in Britain, while it has to be acknowledged that where the story ends up holds no surprises. Yet this holds many pleasures for the right audience, so fingers on the button and see if you get this starter for 10.",8.0
14055,"Starter for 10 is a fun and entertaining movie, and it’s even better because it stars three of my favorite actors—James McAvoy, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Alice Eve. James is great as Brian Jackson, a college student trying to fit in at university and make it onto the ""University Challenge"" quiz team. He really nails the mix of awkwardness and ambition, making his character super relatable.

Benedict is hilarious as the overly serious team captain, and Alice Eve adds a lot of charm as Brian’s crush. The cast really makes this movie shine, even if the story itself is pretty predictable. It’s your classic coming-of-age tale, but it’s done in such a fun way with a lot of humor and heart.

14103,"_**Grim, low-budget version of “King Solomon’s Mines” shot in South Africa**_

Needing quick cash to get his son through college, Allan Quartermain (Sean Cameron Michael) accepts a gig to help a young noble woman (Natalie Stone) & her beau (Daniel Bonjour) find her lost brother who was on an expedition to find the legendary King Solomon’s Mines in remote southeast Africa. Unfortunately for them, an evil mogul wants the map they’re using (Christopher Adamson). 

“Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls” (2008) was put out by The Asylum just before “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” debuted. The company is notorious for releasing cheap knockoffs of major releases to steal some of their thunder. The Asylum has certainly put out some cartoony dreck (e.g. ""30,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""Mega Piranha""), but they can also surprise you with some worthy low-budget stuff (e.g. “6 Guns,” ""The Land That Time Forgot"" and ""Grimm's Snow White""). 

In other words, this movie is a mockbuster, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it HAS to suck.  

The plot was taken from “King Solomon’s Mines” (1985), but it lacks the over-the-top dynamic fun of that movie, which is wildly entertaining. Instead, this is a grim tale about a small group of people searching for the fabled King Solomon’s Mines in remote South Africa and trying to survive the many challenges. On that sparse level with its low mockbuster budget & dubious F/X and fight choreographics, it can be enjoyed for what it is. 

There are some highlights: It was shot entirely in scenic areas of South Africa, which is true to the Allan Quartermain mythos since his family was from Durban, South Africa; the tribal women are blatantly top nude (not that I care, but I found it realistic & daring); there’s a cool talon tool used for executions; and there are some quality story elements, like Umbopa’s arc (Wittly Jourdan).       

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes.

14103,"A straight remake of H. Rider Haggard's ""King Solomon's Mines"" that really does beggar belief! Aside from some decent location photography, this is about as action free an adventure film as I think I have ever seen. A mean and moody Sean Cameron Michael takes the title role, with Christopher Adams really pretty hammy as baddie ""Hartford""; Natalie Stone pouts magnificently as ""Lady Anna"" with the weak and feeble, almost preppie, Daniel Bonjour (""Sir Henry"") bringing up the rear as they search for the latter man's long lost brother ""Neville"" (Nick Everhart). Simply, this is an howler with virtually no redeeming features aside from being marginally less static than my television screen-saver. The dialogue and score offer little by way of a lifeline for this totally unnecessary re-versioning of a great adventure story reduced here to some posh accents, way too much chatter and hardly any actual vitality at all. There is a slight twist at the end from the book, but that really can't make anything like enough of a difference to rescue this from then doldrums of abject mediocrity in which it belongs. I just wouldn't bother, if I were you.",3.0
14116,"I always think it was a little unfair to compare Norman Wisdom to others when so often he was entirely his own man, putting his own unique comedy spin and timing to good use creating a fun atmosphere for a British population still recovering from the effects of WWII. Here, he's the hapless ""Puckle"" whose girlfriend - well a gal he rather likes but who doesn't remotely reciprocate - rejects his offer of chocolates and leaves him contemplating suicide. Luckily, he is deterred from such drastic action by a passing sailor who reckons that if things really are that bad, he ought to join the Royal Navy. For all the wrong reasons, he attracts the attention of the Admiral (Ian Hunter) and now various escapades see him lurch from the frying place to the fire, via a chilly mountaintop, before being put to work on a top secret rocket project that we just know is doomed to failure! Hunter takes on the role usually portrayed by the likes of James Robertson Justice, and he does it well providing a foil for star who is having fun with this fairly low budget affair. The production mixes what looks like stock footage with some studio photography (where you can often see the full effects of the polystyrene and the scenery with clear joins in it) but that doesn't really matter. Assisted by a plethora of familiar faces from British cinema, this is really all about a man who knew how to make a generation laugh and using a combination of light slapstick, military stuffiness and the occasional daft one-liner, he manages to do just that - reminding us that is was, after all, the ordinary folk who fought and won the war!",7.0
14117,"As fizzy as a Sarsparilla.

Calamity Jane is directed by David Butler and written by James O'Hanlon. It stars Doris Day, Howard Keel, Allyn Ann McLerie, Phillip Carey & Dick Wesson. The score features music by Sammy Fain and lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. Out of Warner Brothers, the film is seen as a response to the success of MGM's production of Annie Get Your Gun in 1950, where Keel was also starring. Plot here is loosely based on the life of Wild West heroine Calamity Jane (Day) and explores the relationship between Wild Bill Hickok (Keel) and herself. 

I guess the first thing that should be said is that this is no biography of one Martha Jane Cannary Burke (AKA: Calamity Jane), in truth this is more a comedy musical romp built around that famous frontiers woman, so with it being very basic on narrative and direction, this is predominantly appealing to the film fan with musical leanings. However, on that score the film is utterly delightful, such as it is fronted by the spirited lead performances from Day & Keel and a handful of truly great tunes headed by the Oscar winning ""Secret Love"" (Day luminous and vocally on peak form). 

Pic also earns some bonus points for giving Day the chance to play something other than the naive innocent girl next door type (it was a personal favourite role of hers). She gets to be spunky and brash without ever losing that adorable appeal that carried her throughout her career. The play on sexual stereotypes is rather humorous without being twee, something that you feel director Butler was under appreciated for, while Wilfred M. Cline's gorgeous colour photography enhances the playfulness of it all. 

Seen now as a feminist fantasy with a gay following thanks to ""Secret Love"", there's no denying the film is all very Hollywoodized - with characters so animated they could actually burst. But all told, if one is able to forgive and see past its tiny flaws then this is a film guaranteed to light up the darkest of wintry days. 7.5/10",7.0
14120,"**_There’s more to life than rashly killing people with a spear_**

In 1956, several American missionaries deep in the Amazon basin try to contact the warring Waodani tribe, who live near the Curaray River in eastern Ecuador. Thirty-eight years later, the son of one of the missionaries goes back to the area to reacquaint with the people he met as a child. 

“End of the Spear” (2005) is a drama with some thrills based on the true story. Movies with a similar milieu include “Fitzcarraldo,” “The Emerald Forest,” “At Play in the Fields of the Lord,” “Medicine Man” and “The Lost City of Z,” even “The Mosquito Coast.” Sure, this one is more ‘faith-based’ due to the subject matter, but the director lets the facts speak for themselves with no glossing over and no sanitizing; just the facts. The viewer is left to interpret them.

If you like any of those flicks, you can’t go wrong with this one. Even if you’re a strict atheist, the evangelical element is played down. When the biblical message is conveyed, it’s presented in the same way it was given to the Waodani in real-life: In concepts or symbols from their everyday language. For instance, ‘God’ is replaced with ‘Waengongi,’ which is the creator god of the tribe.

Interestingly, a couple of the Amazonians resemble members of 80’s metal bands Anthrax (Dan Spitz and Joey Belladonna) and Manowar (Joey DeMaio). Seriously. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in Colon, Panama, which is about 800 miles north from where the events actually occurred.

14135,"We see the world through the eyes of a childlike man who has been imprisoned in a squalid house since birth, ignorant of and terrified by stories of the outside and completely reliant on his mother, who beats and makes love to him. We see him forced into the outside world by the return of his parasitic and presumably itinerant father, who wants his place in the home again.   This childlike man, Bubby, realises that the outside world is not what he was made to believe it is and so begins his voyage of discovery.

Through Bubby's eyes we can see a (slightly crazy) city from a naive perspective and it is this sense of wonder and discovery that defines the film.  Bubby is not a clean slate, though.  His past is extremely messed up and this is never forgotten in his characterisation.  So he gets frustrated and angry as well as joyous and excited.  The acting is phenomenal, it really is.  This ain't Forest Gump, not to knock that film but this is next level documtary footage tier.

There's not much of a plot other than Bubby goes from A to Z via every stop along the way.  He finds love and learns that it is all.  There are a couple of incredibly touching scenes that are genuinely beautiful and, as far as I can tell, not acted.  It's a very philosophical film and explicitly encourages an open and critical mind in several scenes,

A has-been racecar driver in San Francisco (Dean Jones) acquires a Volkswagen Beetle and his luck changes on the raceway. He, his mechanic (Buddy Hackett) and potential girlfriend (Michele Lee) start to see that the cute vehicle has a mind of its own. David Tomlinson and Joe Flynn are on hand as dastardly villains.  

""The Love Bug"" (1969) is a fun Disney racing-oriented fantasy that inspired three sequels by 1980, a television movie in 1997 and a 2005 theatrical sequel with Lindsay Lohan. 

This is a good flick when you’re in the mood for some innocent fun, but I feel the latter three movies are the best ones: “Herbie Goes Bananas” (1980), “The Love Bug” (1997) and “Herbie Fully Loaded” (2005) with the 1997 one arguably being my favorite (perhaps because it features the Dark Herbie and Alexandra Wentworth).

But this is the one that started it all. It features a fitting cast and superb locations. It’s a tad overlong though and should’ve been abbreviated by 15-20 minutes.   

The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot entirely in California, including San Francisco, Big Bear Lake, Riverside, Agoura, Santa Clarita, the Monterey Peninsula, Cuddy Valley, San Bernardino National Forest and studios in Burbank.

14136,"David Tomlinson was always pretty reliable as the go-to comic English gent, and he delivers quite well here as the supercilious car dealer ""Thorndyke"". He only deals in the luxury end of the market, so ""Jim"" (Dean Jones) is a bit surprised to find a dilapidated old VW Beetle in his yard. There's something very special about this little car, and soon the down-on-his-luck driver and his mate ""Tennessee"" (Buddy Hackett) have bought him, repaired him and named him ""Herbie"". Magically, his racing fortunes take an about turn and pretty soon his erstwhile owner is after him back - and is prepared to go to just about any lengths as they prepare to compete in one trans-American race and - to the victor the spoils and the the scrapyard with ""Herbie"" if he doesn't win. It's interesting that this was released one year after ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968) - so clearly the theme of magical cars was popular. ""Herbie"" is mischievous and not averse too the odd tantrum which gives him just enough of a personality, coupled with an on form Jones - to create an enjoyable tale of friendship and inter-reliance as well as one of fast-paced antics and even the slightest hint of romance as we tumble down mountains, slide in and out of mud and generally have our own sort of ""Whacky Race"". It's a bit over-scripted and probably twenty minutes too long - I think we all get the gist and could be getting on with the action a bit more quickly, but it's still a decent watch that reminds us of what was hugely popular in the late sixties.",6.0

I would have been some old mad if I had watched the preview first.

But on to the movie itself. This is a Spanish language movie with subtitles, but that didn’t detract from my enjoyment of it. It is nicely set up and cleverly done. At one point I guessed right about a little plot twist I saw coming, but there was much more I didn’t predict, which brings us back to how glad I am I didn’t watch that preview. I expect this was a low budget film and there aren’t many characters in it, so don’t expect a glitzy production with awesome special effects. It just tells the story.

The acting was solid. It wasn’t flashy or overly dramatic, but it felt natural and believable, which kept me invested. The plot is straightforward enough to follow, but it still manages to surprise you. It’s one of those movies where everything clicks into place by the time it wraps up, making the rewatchability high.

This has to be investigated so off he goes, only to arrive and discover a body and to be stabbed by a mysterious man whose face is covered in blood-stained bandages. Who is this character? Well the scissor-wielding felon quickly heads to a remote lab in the woods where we meet “El Joven” (Nacho Vigalondo) who seems to have managed to concoct some sort of time-travelling machine and there is more than one “Hector” now doing the rounds! The young scientist is at his wits end as to what to do whilst the latest iteration of “Hector” has decided he wants to dispose of the others and use the young girl whose body started the whole thing in the first place (Bárbara Goenaga) as a lure. It’s one of those lightly comedic dramas, this, that reminded me of a “Doctor Who” series from the 1980s coupled with some quirky characters and a little naughty voyeurism! Elejalde holds it together quite entertainingly even if there are quite a few plot holes liberally sprinkled throughout - just how this all got started in the first place, for example - and it’s still quite a good fun watch that could almost be be set as a silent film to maximise the daftness of the repetitive but never quite identical scenarios as they play out. Indeed, it’s quite possible that each version of “Hector” suffers from some sort of brain-drain each time, as he definitely gets more and more dopey.

""Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo"" (1977) brings back Dean Jones minus Michele Lee and Buddy Hackett, but Sommars and Knotts are fine in the corresponding roles.

A woman from California traveling through the back roads of Pennsylvania (Daryl Hannah) picks up a traumatized female, who was part of a student archeological team from Boston. The youths were interested in the local Indian burial grounds whereupon they discover some of the remains are quite recent. What’s going on?

Released in 2009, “The Devil’s Ground”, aka “The Cycle,” is a backwoods slasher in the “Wrong Turn” mold with some nods to the “Friday the 13th” flicks, i.e. a hulking masked assailant in the woods with a machete. 

Without giving away vital revelations in the last act, the story comes down to a toxic waste, bitter yokels and some mysterious crows. The Indian burial ground functions simply to attract the out-of-state college students and isn't related to the other stuff, unless you view the grounds as sacred land that curses anyone who desecrates it. Let's be generous to writer/director Micheal Bafaro and go with that.

The striking Lee Tomaschefski stands out on the female front as Lisa, although she doesn’t do much for me personally. Meanwhile Maria Gruending is worth a mention as Tammy and I like protagonist Leah Gibson’s doe-eyed look.

The filmmaking is professional so this is worth checking out for those who appreciate backwaters horror, particularly of the slasher variety. Despite some eye-rolling script flaws, like the map contrivance and the youths constantly referring to the killer as “the monster,” I’d watch this over “Wrong Turn.” But it’s not as entertaining as any of the “Friday the 13th” movies. For a similar Canadian flick that’s more effective, see ""Butchers"" (2020).

The flick runs 1 hour, 28 minutes. It’s a Canadian/Czech production, but I can’t find specific info on filming locations; the credits list the British Columbia Film Commission, so I’m assuming that’s where it was shot (thankfully they don’t show the Cascades or Rockies in the background since the story is set in northwestern Pennsylvania).

An agent for the Department of Public Safety (Gere) is being forced into retirement for overzealousness, but is intent on finding a recently abducted teen female in the desolate areas near Albuquerque while training his replacement (Claire Danes).

""The Flock"" (2007) is a psychological crime drama/thriller involving gross sexual offenders in the mold of ""Hardcore,"" “Se7en,” “Kiss the Girls,” “8MM,” “The General’s Daughter” and “The Cell.” It throws in the new-female-partner angle of Eastwood’s “The Enforcer” mixed with the seedy milieu of his “Tightrope.”

There are interesting insights into the human condition, such as: If you stare into an abyss long enough it might stare back. In other words, when you chase monsters, be careful you don’t become a monster. Moreover, if the guy who despises perverted sex offenders so much has no control over his own flaws, how can he blame the deviants? People tend to justify their failures by looking at the misdeeds of others. It's a natural reaction and typically not a conscious one. Actually, justification is what this flick zeroes in on: Is Babbage (Gere) rightfully enraged? Or is he just acting out his own perversions using his occupation as an excuse?

Gere is kick-axx as Babbage; we need more tough-on-predators agents like him out there. As with “The Enforcer,” you sense a growing connection between his seasoned detective and the newbie (not that they’re police detectives in this case, but they are indeed detectives of a sort). Also on hand are KaDee Strickland (Viola), Avril Lavigne (Beatrice) and Cyd Schulte in a notable uncredited bit (you’ll know when you see it, lol).

There’s a desolateness to the proceedings which fits the subject matter and the Southwest wasteland setting. There’s also some ambiguity in the last act. The film respects the intelligence of the viewer to put the pieces of the puzzle together. It’s superior to the contrived and implausible “Kiss the Girls” and pretty much on par with “Tightrope,” but not as compelling as the others noted.

14160,"""UP"" is a movie that begins with a poignant and emotional experience, immediately tugging at the heartstrings with a touching portrayal of loss and longing. The journey of Carl embarking on adventures inspired by his late wife's dreams is both heartfelt and captivating, drawing viewers into a world filled with emotion and wonder.

The dynamic between Carl, Russell, Kevin, and Dug adds excitement and depth to the story, as they embark on extraordinary adventures together. The over-the-top and ridiculous villain brings a sense of thrill and suspense to the narrative, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

The bond between Carl and Russell, an older gentleman and a Boy Scout, is a central highlight of the film, showcasing a beautiful and heartwarming relationship that blossoms through their shared adventures. The characters of Kevin, the big bird, and Dug, the dog with funny voices, provide comedic relief and add charm to the storyline, creating moments of lightness amidst the emotional weight of the narrative.

While the confusion surrounding the wife's death may be a downside for some viewers, the presence of Muntz as a compelling and fully realized villain adds depth and tension to the plot, keeping audiences engaged throughout the film.

Overall, ""UP"" is a beautifully crafted movie that skillfully balances emotional depth, humor, and adventure, offering a rich and immersive viewing experience for audiences of all ages. The film's ability to evoke a range of emotions and deliver a compelling story makes it a must-watch recommendation for everyone, promising an enjoyable and memorable cinematic journey.",7.0

Roland Emmerich was armed with a $200 million budget, and this is what it produced. It's an easy film to dislike from an intellectual level, artistically as well, while the science fiction boffins no doubt had kittens where the science was concerned. It's also easily one hour too long in length, and come the second half of the marathon it starts to sag. There's only so many times you can watch your lead protagonists escape crumbling carnage - via various modes of transport - before the fun factor begins to wane. However.

The carnage effects are grade ""A"" stuff, eye popping and ear splintering, Emmerich is a master at this sort of thing, and with a likable cast comfortably chewing through the safe disaster film making screenplay, it's a very decent popcorn blockbuster. It also isn't afraid to explore some dark moments, all of which - while not all being a surprise - strike strong emotional chords. It knows its disaster movie roots and is happy to tug on them.

2012 made a $500 million profit, that's a figure not to be ignored. The blockbuster movie loving public lapped it up, they often love this stuff, they just want to see the world exploding and chases and crashes and humans imploding or being heroic. If you have to strip it bare on any sort of cerebral level, then of course it's naked. But fully clothed, attired purely in modern film popcorn clobber, then it's grand dramatic and exciting fun.

14168,"Room 207 and the 3:10 To Yuma.

Van Heflin plays rancher Dan Evans whose family and livelihood is at breaking point due to a devastating drought. Needing money fast, Evans gets thrown a financial lifeline when a reward is offered to escort a recently captured outlaw, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), on to the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. But as Wade's gang closes in to free the shackled outlaw, and the clock starts to tick down, Evans finds himself torn between a sense of social duty and an easy option courtesy of Wade's mind game offer.

Based on a story by Elmore Leonard, this is a tight and tense Western that harks to the wonderful High Noon five years earlier. Directed by Delmer Daves, 3:10 to Yuma sees two of the Western genre's most undervalued performers come together in perfect contrast. Heflin's Evans is honest, almost saintly; but ultimately filling out his life with dullness and too much of a safe approach. Ford's Wade is the other side of the coin, ruthless (the opening sequence sets it up), handsome and very self-confident. This coupling makes for an interesting story-one that thankfully delivers royally on its set-up. As Wade's gang closes in, led by a sleek and mean Richard Jaeckel, Wade toys with Evans, offering him financial gain and gnawing away at him about his abilities as a husband, the tension is palpable in the extreme. Nothing is ever certain until the credits role, and that is something that is never to be sniffed at in the Western genre.

The comparison with High Noon is a fair one because 3:10 to Yuma also deals with the man alone scenario. A man left alone to deal with his adversaries and his own conscience; money or pride indeed. Daves' direction is gritty and suitably claustrophobic, with close ups either being erotically charged {watch out for Felicia Farr's scenes with Ford in the saloon} or tightly wound in room 207 of the hotel; where Heflin & Ford positively excel. His outdoor work, aided by Charles Lawton Jr's photography, also hits the spot, particularly the barren land desperate for water to invigorate it. While the piece also has a tremendous George Duning theme song warbled (and whistled by Ford in the film) by Frankie Laine. Great acting, great direction and a great involving story; essential for fans of character driven Westerns. 8.5/10

Footnote: The film was very well remade in 2007 with two of the modern era's finest leading men, Russell Crowe & Christian Bale, in the dual roles of Ben & Dan respectively. One hopes, and likes to think, that they remade it purely because it was such a great premise to work from. Because Daves' film didn't need improving, it was, and still is, a great film showcasing how great this often maligned genre can sometimes be.",9.0
14168,"A top 50’s Western with Glenn Ford only held back by the B&W photography

RELEASED IN 1957 and directed by Delmer Daves, ""3:10 to Yuma” is a Western about a struggling Arizona rancher, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), who has no choice but to hire-on as an escort of dangerous, but charismatic outlaw, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford). Wade proceeds to employ psychological manipulation in order to corrupt the righteous family man and escape.

This is a quality psychological Western from the 50s, only held back by the B&W photography. The Arizona landscapes are spectacular but they’re all for naught due to this flat B&W presentation. Nevertheless, the story & characters are great. The mind games Wade plays with Evans keeps things interesting. Felicia Farr, the hottie from Glenn Ford’s excellent “Jubal” (1956) is on hand as a bartender who has a thang for bad boys. I’m not complaining about her role, but it’s a tad unlikely that such a smoking hot woman would be alone for too long in the Old West where there were twenty times more men than women.   

Most old Western theme songs are hopelessly hokey, e.g. “North to Alaska” (1960) (a great Western), but the one here sung by Frankie Laine is very good. I like it when words that don't rhyme are made to rhyme in a song: ""There's a legend and a ruma', when you take the 3:10 to Yuma.""

The 2007 remake with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in the Evans/Wade roles takes the template of this film and makes a superior Western with more action and deeper themes, not to mention IN COLOR.

14172,"When I sat down to watch this movie last evening I expected a fairly ordinary direct-to-video (actually it was released to cinema in France) action movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme that would, at best, be somewhat entertaining. Well I was wrong. After having watched the movie I had to say: Wow that was a good movie! Now the threshold for that wow was of course a bit lower than usual since I was not expecting that much from the movie but still, this is a surprisingly good movie.

Sure it has its silly moves and plot holes like most movies of this kind but it is miles away from the usual brain-dead run-of-the-mill action movie.

First of all, Jean-Claude Van Dame makes a quite decent, even good, performance. Personally I am not much for these sentimental cry-scenes but Jean-Claude manages to make these parts well and at the same time he is brutally cool when he is out seeking his revenge.

The action in the movie is also very enjoyable whether it is car chases, motorcycle chases or martial art displays. When it comes to the latter Jean-Claude proves that he is still good at making these scenes unlike for instance Steven Seagal who mostly stands in one spot waving his hands while trying to hide his beer belly. At times the movie is quite cruel. There is a torture scene which is really good without being unnecessarily graphic. Speaking of graphics, the entire movie is well shot. The cinematography is simply very good. I would even say that for this kind of movie it is great. At times this is a very dark movie and those parts of the movie are really the best.

The plot is mostly predictable but I do actually quite like it, as it tells a story about war pigeons from WWII. It is amusing for the majority, even if the characters are strangely overtly horny too much.

The strongest part of this film is easily the cast, who are very good. Ricky Gervais (Bugsy) is the best voice on show, he is the ideal actor to play that role. There are many other familiar voices: Ewan McGregor (Valiant), John Cleese (Mercury), Jim Broadbent (Monty), Hugh Laurie (Gutsy) and Tim Curry (Von Talon); as well as one or two others. McGregor is largely positive, even if he does get a tad too sappy in parts.

I wasn’t concerned when a few reviews remarked that it moved slowly, as we have always appreciated movies that build a quiet story carefully, and mostly this one did that.

My only criticism is that at the outset of the movie, I didn’t quite believe that Walter was in love with Kitty. He said he was, but I wonder if a scene or two showing him falling for her ended up on the cutting room floor. He merely seemed to stalk her around the party and want to marry her before he left for China. Similarly, Kitty falling for Charlie didn’t seem well constructed. It felt like one scene they stared at each other, flirted a bit, and the next scene they are in bed.

But once I suspended that bit of disbelief, the film was great. Gradually Kitty develops as a character, and her marriage begins to be rebuilt from the rubble of her earlier actions.

Elias Koteas (you might remember him from The Prophecy) stars as Jonas Talbot, uncle of the prophesized 12-year-old who's destiny is to become a werewolf-cure on the eve of his 13th birthday. There are many shoot-outs for a werewolf film, to the point where the director said that it was ""shot as a western"". In _the shooting at Huguenot_, the tranquility preceding the chaos is as described in The Professional (in other words, there's a ""peaceful little moment before the storm"").

There are many unique elements to this film, such as a falcon that seeks out the kid's presence for the _villainous_ skinwalkers (the ones who prefer death over a cure).

Throughout the film, it's unclear how the kid is supposed to be a werewolf-fix, but imo, the twist at the end is quite clever and grounded in reality. So if you like originality, suspense, and Natassia Malthe in a biker top, you might want to check this one out, per se. 7.5/10",8.0

Two students car share for a journey home at the end of term. Taking a short cut they get run off the road and find themselves stranded in the snow. Then strange things start to happen... Neither frightening or dull, Wind Chill is a very serviceable supernatural based drama with human interest factors pulsing away. Setting is superbly chilly, which when our protags are stranded opens up genuine fears for all of us who have ever broken down somewhere remote at night. The revelations and finale are hardly riveting stuff, but it gets top marks for a sense of dread and that for a good portion of film it's not apparent what is actually going on.

Kim Basinger as Holli Would was fun, to say the least. And Gabriel Byrne just look confused.

After her mother dies in a tragedy, a teen girl (Emily Browning) is sent to a mental hospital. Upon returning to her father’s mansion on the coast of Maine, she reunites with her older sister (Arielle Kebbel) and tries to get along with her dad’s new girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks), her mother’s former nurse, who appears to be taking over. David Strathairn plays the father, a successful author.

“The Uninvited” (2009) is a mystery/horror that combines elements of “The Sixth Sense” (1999), “Half Light” (2006) and “The Ring” (2002), although it’s a little more subdued than the latter. If you like the haunting tone of those movies and the spectacular locations of the latter two, you’ll appreciate it. Browning with her ultra-cute face was 20 during filming, but looks 14. Meanwhile Banks is effective as the biyatch gold-digger and Strathairn is convincing as the clueless father.

The story plays out in a too-predicable manner. If you saw the trailer beforehand it basically tells you everything you need to know. But not really: The last 15 minutes pulls the rug out with some surprising revelations. I heard there was a twist before viewing and went over various possibilities in my mind while watching, but the movie fooled me. Great job on this front. Not everything is as it appears. I’d say more, but I don’t want to spoil it.

My relatively high rating is due to the lingering power of the film's message on individual perception. It's potent and applicable stuff, expertly executed.

The film doesn’t overstay its welcome at a mere 1 hour, 27 minutes. It wasn’t shot in the Northeast, however, but obviously British Columbia (Bowen Island). It’s an American remake of the Korean film “A Tale of Two Sisters” (2003).

14285,"In November 1976 in Dallas, Texas, Police Officer Robert Wood was shot and killed while making an otherwise routine traffic stop. One man was arrested and sentenced to death for the crime, based on the testimony of a sixteen year old acquaintance. These basic facts are covered in one of the most brilliant films to come out of the 1980's. Randall Adams was no drifter. He was moving from Ohio and was staying in Dallas with his brother. He found a good job, and planned on living there a while. Then he met David Harris, a punk from a Klan-infested small town in southern Texas. The officer is murdered, and Harris blames Adams, even though Harris gloated about shooting the young cop to his friends. Adams was railroaded into prison while Harris embarked on a petty crime spree. He continued his misdemeanor ways until he actually killed a man during a botched kidnapping. Now Harris was in jail, and Adams was still appealing his conviction. Witnesses came forward claiming to have seen Adams shoot Wood, yet none of them have a gleam of credibility. Finally, Adams gets some decent lawyers, who begin working to get him out. He is granted an appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court, but as of the making of the film, he was still serving life in prison. A little research shows what happened to Randall Adams.

Errol Morris goes where few documentary makers go. He films convincing reenactments of the crime. These are not ""Unsolved Mysteries""-type reenactments, Morris has a real director's eye, and gives the audience every detail needed- from a tossed milkshake to the number of people spotted in the killer's car. Philip Glass adds a haunting musical score that gets under your skin and hypnotizes you. The convict Adams is a sincere man, and the film makers are obviously rooting for his cause. Harris is an ignorant punk, enjoying playing games with people's lives. If the Dallas County prosecutors had done their job, Harris would not have committed his second murder: food for thought. Harris' final interview, done on audio cassette, is chilling, and will make a believer of anyone who otherwise thought ""this could never happen to me."" The three ""witnesses"" to the slaying are a joke, two in it for the reward, and a salesman who boasts of his photographic memory but cannot recall if Wood's patrol car was in front of or behind Harris' stolen vehicle. ""The Thin Blue Line"" is more than talking heads, this is a searing story that puts to shame any fiction that tries to cover the same ground.

Gotta respect those associated with getting <em>'Better Luck Tomorrow'</em> off the ground, reportedly with big help from one MC Hammer - I didn't expect to read that! However, I didn't like it sadly. You can tell if has a competent director in charge with Justin Lin, though everything to do with the plot and characters just didn't do it for me.

I found the story too far-fetched, personally. I have no issue watching stuff that is nonsensical, but when it is along those lines then it has to be very entertaining and this wasn't, for me. The actors didn't quite work either, not even Sung Kang as Han - who was the sole reason why I wanted to watch this, given the (loose) <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em> connection.

Parry Shen is underwhelming, his voice-overs are particularly dull - he is fairly likeable, I'm just not sure Shen (or his character) were a wise choice for lead. Jason Tobin as Virgil is also a tad irritating (as intended?), while Kang is actually quite forgettable; this Han is barely anything like the F&F version, quite the large reach for them to connect the two, if I'm honest.

A quick look at the Wikipedia article for this, which also talks about some other interesting production events (Macaulay Culkin?! Big props to Lin for rejecting that, despite the £££), notes that apparently Sung Kang wanted to play Ben - now that could've been something!

14291,"**The intricate world of chess, in the shadow of one of its most controversial masters.**

There is, in the world of sport – and for all intents and purposes, competitive chess turns out to be like a sport – a certain obsession with the stars, and their replacement when they go away. This is perhaps most visible in football: Messi has often been described as the new Maradona, to give you an example of what I'm talking about. This film follows a bit of the same logic: after having a chess grand master who won an important world tournament against the unbeatable Russians (and in the middle of the Cold War), the film takes us to the world of junior chess, following the steps of a young prodigy who could eventually be the “successor” to that famous player, Bobby Fisher.

Little note: being a genius doesn't mean being a good person or a person you'll like. Bobby Fisher is already dead, and he died relatively young, but he guided his public life and his career by unpredictable behavior, enormous eccentricity and statements to journalists that are controversial, to say the least. He held quite radical world views, he was, it seems, anti-Semitic and a Holocaust denier. Fisher's statements about the US, his home country – which he left many years ago – are truly incendiary and critical. All it takes is a little internet research to verify this.

I don't know how popular chess is nowadays, but here in Portugal it is common and very popular at school level, more as a recreational activity, not as a competition. I remember, in my school days, leaving the classroom and spending almost every break playing chess against my friends. And we took the game seriously, with pleasure and enthusiasm. We were aware of the complexity of the game, but we never worried about being ferociously good, just having fun. But I think anyone who knows how to play chess understands how challenging a game it can be.

The film has an excellent cast. Max Pomeranc, despite being very young, is a likeable protagonist who seems torn between genius and normality. It makes him approachable and gives him a fascinating weakness for someone so obviously smart, and the young actor had the ability to understand the character in this way, and balance himself in this rich personality. Next to us, we have two great actors – Ben Kingsley and Joe Mantegna – who give us very successful jobs. For me, this film is one of Mantegna's best. Joan Allen also does a satisfying but less interesting job, and Laurence Fishburne could have been better used.

Steven Zaillian had the brains to give us a film filled with intellect, intelligence and good feelings. The script is well written, and the dialogues are quite good. The choice of filming locations, sets and costumes, all help to build a familiar, friendly, very elegant film. There are no great effects, the film doesn't require them, but there is an effective soundtrack, very discreet, and reasonably well done cinematography.",8.0
14292,"Disney doing what they do best with this sort of material.

It's a feel good sports movie based around the true story of Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) who had the unenviable task of leading the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team in the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid. Where the all conquering Russian squad were waiting.

We follow Brooks as he assembles a youthful squad then pushes them to the limits, mentally and physically, all while facing pressures in his home life as he gives his all on the ice rinks. If you know your sports history then there's obviously no surprise factor here, but there's good insight into squad dynamics, of coaching and toughness involved in the many facets of high level sport. Russell leads his young cast admirably, while the action scenes during the matches have a kinetic energy that's most impressive. 7/10",7.0

The constant connections to world events can feel a little forced in parts, but I entirely get what they were going for - it doesn't hamper things at all, anyway.

Kurt Russell is superb as Herb Brooks, he's far and away the best and most interesting character/actor onscreen. Russell nails the role. Elsewhere, Noah Emmerich does a solid job, as do those who portray the players - even if none of them stick in my memory much.

The score is strong, as are most things about this film. It probably goes on for a tad too long, they could've cut thirty minutes without losing anything major. It doesn't drag though, to its credit.

14320,"If I were ever to be given the chance to be a fly-on-the-wall at a conversation, then It'd have to be one with Charles Dickens and David Lean. How the latter managed to visualise and dramatise so expertly the finely honed characters of the former is astonishing. In this, possibly less well known story - ""Pip"" (Tony Wager) encounters an escaped convict in an eery graveyard when he goes to tend his late mother's grave.. Despite his fear, he helps feed the old man and free him from his chains. As he ages, he is summoned by a local, wealthy, spinster ""Miss Havisham"" (a wonderfully imperious Martita Hunt) who wants him to befriend the truly unpleasant, spoilt, ""Estella"" (Jean Simmons). Skip forwards a few years and ""Pip"" (now, John Mills) is rescued from his rural existence by a lawyer, the ever avuncular, sagacious, Francis L. Sullivan who advises him that he has is to receive an income and an inheritance, from an unknown benefactor, that will change his life - which it duly does! Soon, he and new room-mate ""Mr. Pocket"" (Alec Guinness) are settled into their new lives of plenty. Dickens' had such a wonderfully alliterative way with his characters - ""Pip"", ""Pocket"", ""Jaggers"", ""Pumblechook"" & ""Magwitch"" - they allow so much more scope for your imagination to define the characters, their traits and flaws and Lean manages to use light, shade, an understated Walter Goehr score and a really splendid ensemble effort from all concerned on screen to really draw us into the plot as ""Pip"" edges nearer to finding out where his largesse is coming from and, of course, how his relationship with a now adult ""Estella"" (Valerie Hobson) might develop/conclude/collapse.

14347,"**_Fun romcom with spectacular locations but too, um, sleazy_**

Two well-to-do Americans from the big city are having marital problems. So they take their 18 years-old daughters to Rio de Janeiro to refresh. The liberal one (Joseph Bologna) doesn’t waste time in finding a dubious mate for his carnal pleasures while the conservative one (Michael Caine) makes the mistake of being with the daughter of the other on the beach wherein she confesses her crush (Michelle Johnson). Nothing good can come from this. 

“Blame It on Rio” (1984) is effectively quirky amusement with can’t-beat-’em locations. The best comparison would be “10” from five years earlier, but this isn’t as good all things considered. There’s a great message on forgiveness at the end, but there’s a little too much sleaze for my tastes. For instance, Michelle Johnson was five months shy of being 18 during shooting, yet she’s shown totally nude at one point. Why? The movie suggests that the hedonistic spirit of Rio sets loose one’s carnal passions. 

Also on the feminine front are Demi Moore as the other daughter (she was 20 during shooting); and Valerie Harper as the wife of Caine’s character. Valerie still looked great at 44 during filming.

The movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Rio de Janeiro.

14353,"Surprised me to hear when I looked into this feature that it was not well received at the time of its release... disappointing wtf is wrong with people but I’d put this film up there with Rocky Horror Picture Show...
Set in a distant dystopian future where organisms failures are a sure thing, a company named Gencon swoops in on society and sets up Payment plans for people to afford these organ replacements but if payments stopped they sent the “Repo-Man” after you. Starring Anthony Head, Sarah Brightman, Bill Mosely, Paul Sorvino, and Paris Hilton... whose only role as far as I’m concerned that I remember was getting her head cut off in House of Wax he he... 
We have a mother who dies at birth from a poison switched from a possible cure by The Gencon Dude.  But the father thinks it was his fault. Plus him being the Repo Man and Gencon’s little torture slave he must keep this secret from his little Shiloh.
This being said this modern day gothic musical is narrated by a graverobber played by Terrance Zdunich whom is also the writer of the film as well as the man behind the motion comic segments... he has a powerful voice which isn’t nearly forgotten...
Meanwhile the head dude at Gencon has found out he’s got something terminal that can’t be fixed.  He’s got three deranged children, who seem to be whiny one who reminds my of something in between Texas chainsaw or V for Vendetta....

14359,"Knee-deep in the throes of my first love, I was quite surprised to hear that my lady's favourite movie was 'Joe Versus the Volcano'. (I still haven't seen the film). It dawned on me, when I wanted to check out an American film which, to my knowledge, had a plethora of fine acting, that this was written and directed by the same guy who made that film much earlier. Being raised Christian and hearing in the press over the past few years about misdeeds, especially involving leaders of the Catholic church (represented in films as diverse as 'The Boys of St. Vincent' (John N. Smith, 1992) and 'In Bruges' (Martin McDonagh, 2008), I was especially intrigued by this, his work of more recent vintage.

The ambiguity at the core of the film (and hence the 'doubt') really acts in the movie's favour. The script and direction are both tense and flawless, and the beautiful New York locations chosen to illustrate The Bronx in 1964 help air the play out, and give it more cinematic scope. It features some of the finest work I have seen from Philip Seymour Hoffman (though my favourites will always be 'Happiness' and 'The Master'), Meryl Streep (my most-esteemed works of hers are 'The Deer Hunter' and 'The Devil Wears Prada') and Amy Adams (this is her finest performance IMHO) as well as a breakthrough role for Viola Davis, who steals every scene she's in. This easily holds up well even with Shanley's Oscar-winning screenplay for 'Moonstruck', and, though dark and depressing, is thoroughly recommended for those who can stomach its subject matter, and peer into that abyss without flinching, as these fine exemplars of 21st-century American cinema so easily do here.

That it didn't win any of its five Oscar nominations is almost as ghastly, to the cinephile, as the misdeeds insinuated here are to the community at large. Must have been a strong year for film, methinks.",9.0
14359,"There is wonderful scene in this film where ""Fr. Flynn"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) tries to explain, using feathers, just how wicked gossip can be. He is the victim of such nefarious chatter - but is he guilty? Well ""Sister Aloysius"" (Meryl Streep) believes so. She sees the father with a student on the street outside the school, then her colleague ""Sister James"" (Amy Adams) mentions that another, their first young black child ""Donald"" (Joseph Foster), looked a bit distressed after meeting with the priest in is vestry. She is determined to get to the truth and to be rid of this man. Streep is very convincing here. She portrays a woman who, based on the thinnest of actual evidence, relies on the certainty of her belief to level accusations against the man. Using that certainly, she confronts him imploring confession but is there anything to confess? Hoffman is also effective as a man that I initially had sympathies for - he was, after all, being victimised by his colleague with no evidence from the supposed victims and the first lad - ""London"" (Mike Roukis) was a distinctly untrustworthy boy. Viola Davis offers just the one principal scene as the affected boy's stoic mother, and that is a potent rationalisation of not just where she felt a young black kid sat on the ladder of society at the time, but also of where she felt the church sat on her own. She is a loving mother conflicted, and this is portrayed with intensity. I wasn't sold on the ending, either way it was unsatisfactory but this is still a well crafted and thought provoking assembly of strong acting talent and a solid story.",7.0

14370,"The Big Bang guys when they were in college (not really, but sort of)

RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Martha Coolidge, ""Real Genius"" is a college dramedy about a 15 year-old genius in laser technology (Gabe Jarret) who’s recruited by physics Professor Jerry Hathaway (William Atherton), who has ulterior motives for having the kid work in his personal lab. The newbie’s roommate turns out to be the most brilliant freshman in history, who’s now a senior and seemingly clouded by college-age mischief (Val Kilmer). Michelle Meyrink plays a kinetic student interested in Mitch (Jarret) while Jonathan Gries appears as a curious wraith-like individual. Robert Prescott is on hand as a brown-nosing foil.   

To give you an idea of the filmmaking style, the director also made 1983’s “Valley Girl.” “Real Genius” is generally on par with that more popular movie, but different due to the setting being college rather than high school, not to mention that it involves genius types. I found the witty nonchalance of Kilmer’s character to be trying after a while and there’s a pervading sense of un-reality about the proceedings with the peripheral characters unconvincingly over-the-top, like during the pool party or at the restaurant/bar. The ice playground at the frat house is another good example. Why sure!     

Still, there’s enough good here if you like 80’s youth dramedies. I like the way the characters are unique rather than tried-and-true stereotypes of the genre, like jock types, hot bimbos or John Belushi’s character in “Animal House” (1978).

14373,"Kersey Chaos.

Michael Winner once again pushes the buttons of Hollywood with this sequel to his controversial hit, Death Wish. Plot follows a familiar trajectory, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is now in Los Angeles living a normal life, when wouldn't you know it, some scumbag youths cross his path after administering some rape and pillage on folk close to him... 

The problem here, and the reason why some critics positively burst blood vessels after watching it, is that for the first half it just is pure exploitation, this in spite of some decent production value. Did it really need to be another sex crime? Could it not have been a murder et al? There gets a point in the film where you sense it's boobs for boobs sake. Though you have to wonder if Winner dared to ask Chuck and Jill Ireland (playing girlfriend of Chuck...) if Jill would do a nude scene? I think a broken nose may have come about if that subject had of been broached... 

Once Kersey (Bronson hard as nails again) goes about dealing out his brand of justice, the film hits its straps, teasing the viewers with moral - cum - ethical outrage or conversely, vicarious thinking. Vigilante films are always going to swim in tricky waters, provoking anger and heated debate from all walks of the political spectrum, but better to have them out there to provoke a response than not. Surely? 

There is nothing remotely high end here, but it's a film worthy of its above average rating on IMDb. It can shock, annoy, dismay and even induce unintentional mirth (three of the rapist thugs dance the campiest dance ever), but it will not be ignored and people are still seeking it out today to watch for the first time.

Director Ralph Nelson doesn't pull any punches; disfigurement, immolation, decapitation, and impalement (amongst other acts of barbarity) splash across the screen - often in Sam Peckinpah-style slow motion. These opening and closing scenes have power; the problem is the 100 minutes we have to spend with the one-dimensional survivors of the initial Indian assault. Candice Bergen and Peter Strauss are given generic, facile characters to interpret; one is naive, one is worldly (of course); one is prudish, the other permissive (surprise); they gradually develop feelings for one another (if you didn't see that coming...). Donald Pleasance eventually shows up for some much needed variety, but it's not enough. If you're a fan of violent western-style action, you'll enjoy some of this. If you're fond of budding romance pics, then the love story might engage you. Everyone else would probably be better served by watching LITTLE BIG MAN (1970) again.",4.0
14384,"**_Playful Western Romance sandwiched between two brutal massacres_**

After a paymaster cavalry unit is slaughtered by the Cheyenne in 1877, a surviving soldier and Indian sympathizer team-up to get back to the nearest fort (Peter Strauss and Candice Bergen). The young man struggles with contempt for what he considers a treasonous attitude along with his growing affection for the brash woman. Then he sees the awful truth firsthand.

""Soldier Blue"" (1970) is an entertaining, but odd Western. At heart, it’s a fun romance between a patriotic military man and a profane “free-spirit” who is able to survive the challenges of the American wilderness precisely because she has shed Victorian inanities. This is bookended by a Cheyenne-led massacre on a non-threatening cavalry group and the military massacre of a peaceful Cheyenne camp, filled with women and children. The latter is obviously based on the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864.

I respect that the movie shows how massacres happened on both sides, but it stacks the deck against the Caucasian militants by showing them butchering women & children and not vice versa. 

The opening Indian attack ensures that the viewer's sympathies are with Honus (Strauss, the eponymous ‘Soldier Blue’), so you travel the same journey as him: At first, regarding the Indians as bloodthirsty savages who have no qualms about committing mass murder and abusing corpses if it’ll help them acquire firearms but, ultimately, ending up with the revelation that Honus’ ‘tribe’ can be just as barbaric when fitting, and even more so.

Barbaric attacks applied to both uncivilized First Americans and more civilized New Americans, but more so with the former, which is documented. Since the 1960s-70s there has been an overemphasis on the injustices committed by the US military or militants/settlers and we get a handful of examples: Wounded Knee, Bear River and Sand Creek (the latter being what this is loosely based on). Yet we never hear the other side of what provoked these events, including the atrocities that First Americans committed against New Americans. We never hear of the Dakota ""War"" of 1862 where Santee Sioux went on the warpath murdering between 600-800 settlers, which constituted the largest death toll inflicted upon American civilians by an enemy force until 9/11 (civilians, not soldiers); The Ward Massacre; The Nez Perce uprising, which killed dozens of settlers in Idaho and Wyoming; and the Massacre at Fort Mims. We never hear of the countless innocent settlers (not soldiers) who were murdered by bands of young ""warriors"": While a chief was signing a peace treaty on the tribe's behalf, they were out robbing, raping and murdering.

In short, it's easy to be pro-AmerIndian sitting on the comfort of your sofa, but not so much when you & your loved ones are threatened with gross torture, rape and slaughter in the wilderness.

The Euro-settlers wanted the land and resources while the AmerIndians craved the valuable technology of the New Americans. Both sides used treaties for peaceable relations while still trying to get what they desired when war was too costly. Both opted for combat when deemed necessary.

I should add that the real military leader who ordered the attack on the Sand Creek camp in southeast colorado, John Chivington, wasn’t even an Army officer, but rather a self-appointed head of militia in the Colorado Territory during the Civil War when most capable men were away fighting for the Union in the East (remember, the real Sand Creek Massacre happened during the Civil War, not in 1877). The atrocity Chivington & his men committed at Sand Creek was separate from the US Army and not typical of government policy. In the immediate aftermath, Captain Silas Soule, an officer of the First Colorado Cavalry, condemned it as an unjust and savage massacre executed on a peaceful camp.

I’m part Abenaki and love American Indian culture, but the Leftist whitewashing of Indian atrocities and the corresponding revisionist history is deceitful and unbalanced. ""Soldier Blue"" is guilty of this to a degree, but features enough balance to make it worthwhile (as opposed to the grossly dishonest “Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here” from 9-10 months earlier). It's entertaining and offers equilibrium concerning the Indian Wars even though its sympathies tend to be with the First Americans.

The fourth part of the St. Trinian's themed films is the first to be shot in colour, and also the point where someone should have realised that this series had run out of steam. Based on Ronald Searle's demonic schoolgirls, this outing cribs off of the topical Great Train Robbery of the 60s, retains George Cole as a reassuring presence, while adding Dora Bryan and Frankie Howerd for some acting solidification.

It's not a bad film as such, in fact the last quarter, where a whole host of train shenanigans come into play, is great fun, it's just that it feels tired, less risky, like the makers were hedging their bets to get a box office winner (which came to fruition). Fast framing is a bit of a cheat, Howerd is wasted - or sleepwalking through the film? But Bryan is on hand for a bit of quality while the girls are all boisterous and minxy.

Needless to say, they want access to their ill-gotten gains hidden under the floorboards - and when the unruly girls get wise to their plotting, shenanigans galore ensue! Bryan and Howerd both have good comedy coming and a degree of chemistry, but the latter is too domineering as an actor and as character - and as I was never really his biggest fan anyway, I found he rather robbed the thing of any subtlety or hint of comedic sophistication. If you like, ""St. Trinians"" is now steaming towards ""Carry On"" territory and leaving behind it the charming boisterousness of previous iterations. It isn't terrible and some of the humour is still quite perky, but these have run their course now, I'd say.",6.0

Such is the question posed by this potent Omen clone...with a ransom twist. 

Josh Holloway stars as Max, a down-on-his-luck opportunist, freshly released from prison. Max probably has a history of complying with his older friend Sydney, who (at the start of the film) suggests that they (along with their other friend Vince) kidnap an 8-year-old for ransom.

Little David was hand-picked by the group's current employer (Jones), and although Max is reluctant at first, a denied bank loan leaves him no choice but to comply. However, it soon becomes quite clear that David Sandborn is probably no ordinary child.

This kid seems to know everyone's past and future, and the group can't help but notice they're constantly hearing whispers that seem to be in the kid's voice.

Roxanne (Max's girl) has been against this ""gig"" from the beginning (partly due to a bad feeling, partly due to having a history with Vince). Maybe her intuition is telling her that this particular kid will do anything he can to turn them against each other.

Young David has a certain outcome in mind, and he will manipulate anyone who tries to stop him. Whisper is simply a brutalizer of a film in which a seemingly normal child is bloodthirsty, and there seems to be no limit to what he can achieve. 7/10",7.0

Warning: Spoilers
 
Body Heat is written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan and stars William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, Richard Crenna, Ted Danson, J.A. Preston and Mickey Rourke. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Richard H. Cline. Plot sees Hurt as small time Florida lawyer Ned Racine who falls in love and lust with smouldering babe Matty Walker (Turner). Trouble is is that she is married, and as the affair grows more torrid, the pair begin to hatch plans to kill the husband (Crenna) so as to be together and get very rich in the process...

Well some can chide it for its debt to Double Indemnity, or even glance scornfully at Kasdan for using sex to sell his reinvention of amoral noirs of the 40s and 50s, but it stands tall and proud in my book of best neo-noirs produced. Causing quite a stir upon its release, Body Heat under Kasdan's watchful eye has most things right for a nod to the glory days of film noir. Male protagonist caught in a lusty web of deceit and murder, femme fatale so smouldering her skin literally does burn, twists and turns in the narrative, photography keeping it down low on light but expanding the colours for extra lurid effect, and a score that fuses seedy like jazz with low Bondian base strains that suddenly get attacked by a shrill to outline the hapless Racine's imploding panic. The dialogue, too, is devilish, especially when delivered so sensually by Turner's crafty honey, a lady bridging the gap between Lauren Bacall and Jessica Rabbit. Yep! Body Heat has it all going on.

That was her special gift, she was relentless.

Basically Kasdan has brought to life the suggestion involved of something like Double Indemnity, and set it in a sweltering modern day Florida. Free of any code restrictions, he unleashes the sex between the two principals and wraps his biting story around it. It's never sordid or done for the sake of selling tickets, it expertly realises the passion, trickery, and even genuine love? That's going on between Matty and Ned. Helps, too, that Turner and Hurt are terrific in performance and chemistry, while the support cast, courtesy of well thought out writing, really flesh out the plot. There's a problem for genre fans that stop it being a masterpiece all told, that of there being no shock factor come the finale reveal, but the slow boil to the outcome is positively gripping. While the visual views we get of Matty in the final frames leave a question tantalisingly hanging in the air...

""In the hundred years since the Victoria Cross was created for valour and extreme courage beyond that normally expected of a British soldier in the face of the enemy, only 1,344 have been awarded, 11 of these were won by the defenders of the mission station at Rorke's Drift, Natal, January 22nd to the 23rd 1879"" 

Just typing out that spoken narration from Richard Burton brings me out into goose pimples, and the hairs on the back of my neck stand to attention, Zulu quite simply is my favourite film of all time, and my love for cinema to this day owes its credit to this 1964 masterpiece. 

Zulu is a perfectly staged, perfectly acted account of the British defence of Rorke's Drift, where 139 British soldiers held off 4000 Zulu Warriors at the height of the Anglo-Zulu War. Its strength is not in romanticism or over sentimentality in the name of glossy hard sell, the crux lies with just being a tale of pure courage, a tale of pure stoic heroism, it sticks vigorously to the actual events, and thus the film plays out with genuine honesty that few other War pictures can ever lay claim to. 

Where does one start when outlaying the brilliance this picture has to offer? The Natal location is stunning, beautiful lush rolling hills dwarf this tiny outpost, the sky a never ending eye witness to the courage unfolding, Stephen Dade's photography perfectly capturing this colourful extravaganza. The direction from the criminally undervalued Cy Enfield is excellent, along with his star and producer (Stanley Baker in a role of a lifetime) he manages to direct some of the most amazing battle sequences put onto the screen, the discipline of man to man combat perfectly orchestrated by Enfield. The Zulu extras, who once had no idea what they was supposed to do at first, finally grasped the concept of movie making and added weight to the drama. It's now down in legend that Baker showed the chiefs a Gene Autry Western and that got them into the swing of things! 

The acting right through the cast is astonishing, Baker, Michael Caine, Jack Hawkins, James Booth, Nigel Green, Ivor Emmanuel and Patrick Magee are just some of the cast that shine bright and bold. John Barry's score is blood pumping to the maximum, swirling strings collide with thumping base drums to give one the feeling of invincibility. Ernest Archer's art decoration, Arthur Newman's costumes and of course the John Prebble screenplay that is Zulu's heart. I could go on and name everyone involved in this picture, such is the admiration I have for the work involved. But really the story sells itself, not a glossy British victory in sight (the British defenders were allowed to withdraw from the engagement gracefully), this is not just another British fable of imperialistic fervour, it's just a tale of bayonets with guts behind them, and ultimately a story of when men really were men, all in the line of duty.

14433,"A superb adventure tale about a British battalion charged with the defence of a mission station at Rorke's Drift from an army of Zulu who wish to remove the red devils from their lands. Stanley Baker plays ""Lt. Chard"" who takes command of this troop of engineers and has to plan and implement the defence of his ramshackle post whilst also combatting the superiority complex of Michael Caine's ""Lt. Bromhead"" who hails from a distinguished family of military and who, initially resents the leadership of this amateur, and the drunken preacher Jack Hawkins who's mission they are stranded in. John Prebble and Cy Endfield keep the script tight; and John Barry delivers a suitably grand score for this beautifully shot film with plenty of action, and quite a bit of dry humour too. It delivers well a sense of the relentlessness of the attacking Zulu: their pride, courage - and integrity, as well as giving us a shared feeling of the sheer exhaustion of those defending their outpost and their lives. It's even got some rousing male voice choristry too...!",8.0
14435,"Harry Warden is dead…
 
My Bloody Valentine is directed by Patrick Lussier and collectively written by Zane Smith, Todd Farmer and John Beaird. It stars Jensen Ackles, Jaime King, Kerr Smith, Kevin Tighe and Tom Atkins. Music is by Michael Wandmacher and cinematography by Brian Pearson
 
A remake of George Mihalker’s 1981 slasher, the 2009 version was released in a blaze of 3D frenzy, where it absolutely coined it in at the World’s box offices. It’s not hard to see why, for no matter how much we may moan about remakes and the general languid nature of slashers turned out just for coin, there’s a big market out there for them. As it happens this isn’t half bad, oh it’s all very familiar, there’s another Michael Myers clone stalking the residents of some American town and offing them in gruesome ways. Here the perp is The Miner, dressed up in his work clothes, armed with a pickaxe, face covered by a gas mask that in turn makes him creepy looking and gives him Darth Vader breathing exercises to do. 
 
The mystery element is that this new series of murders are being re-enacted from crimes ten years previously, so is the old killer back from the dead, or is there a copycat at large? Enter troubled teenagers, townsfolk acting suspiciously and mucho blood and screaming sitting in tandem together. There’s the requisite amount of nudity, including one of the longest nude scenes ever, while Lussier shows a good knack for blending humour with the terror. The 3D is of a high standard, and the sound mix is incredible, this really is one to give your sub-woofer a work out. It pans out as expected, but it manages to eek out good suspense for its finale and having Atkins and Tighe in the movie is a reassuring presence.
 
The original was no great film anyway, and although this is better, it’s still just a bunch of acting props being killed in different ways. But it is effective and above all else it’s fun. 7/10",7.0
14435,"***Quite good, as slashers go***

The heir of a mine (Jensen Ackles) in a remote town in Pennsylvania returns ten years after a Valentine’s Day massacre that took the lives of 22 people. When a psycho slayer dressed as a miner with a pickaxe also shows up the sheriff (Kerr Smith) naturally suspects the heir, who happens to be the ex-beau of his wife (Jaime King). 

""My Bloody Valentine"" (2009) is a remake of the 1981 slasher but is different enough to view as a sort-of sequel. It includes most of the vital elements for an effective flick of this genre.

The basic formula was well established by ""Halloween"" (1978) and the first two ""Friday the 13th"" flicks (1980-1981): A crazy masked killer and a group of youths in a specific environment, whether a town, camp, forest, college, resort, building, etc. In this case it's a mining town, shot in Kittanning and Bethel, PA, and points nearby along the Allegheny River. So the film gets a big plus for filming somewhere other than friggin’ British Columbia! (Not that there's anything wrong with BC, of course, but enough is enough).

Beautiful women is a must for these types of films and ""My Bloody Valentine"" delivers superbly with Jaime King (Sarah), Megan Boone (Megan) and Betsy Rue (Irene), the latter in an extended nude scene, which I think is unnecessary, but some will obviously appreciate it.

Most importantly, the story is engrossing and keeps you guessing as to the identity of the killer till the very end. Compared to the original movie, it’s more compelling and all-around more entertaining.

The film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes.

14438,"I think Catherine Holt (Erin Bethea) sums up very well what’s wrong with her marriage to Caleb (Kirk Cameron): “You can’t expect me to work every day and get the groceries while you look at trash on the Internet dreaming about your boat.” 

She has a point, or rather two. According to her, Caleb “tuck[s] away a third of [his] salary saving for a boat we don’t need. [He has] $24,000 in savings when things in our house need fixing."" 

You can’t argue with that; having a boat is after all a single guy kind of thing to do. I don’t need to tell the movie this – what with it being a ""faith-based” drama –, but “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” In other words, ye cannot have a wife and a boat.

As for the “trash” that Caleb is so fond of – i.e., porn –, I could see a way to work that into a marriage, but then both parties would have to be on board, and that’s precisely the problem with this movie. 

To help him save his marriage, Caleb’s father John (Harris Malcom) presents him with “The Love Dare;” a 40-day program that goes something like this: “Day one: … For the next day resolve to say nothing negative to your spouse at all. If the temptation arises, choose not to say anything … Day two: … In addition to saying nothing negative to your spouse today, do at least one unexpected gesture as an act of kindness,” and so on and so forth (on the 16th day he has to pray for her; in the movie’s funniest line, Caleb confesses “I kind of skipped that one.” This obviously happens before he relents and accepts Jesus Christ into his heart). 

Catherine takes her husband’s newfound attentiveness with a grain of salt (her friends advise her that “He’s trying to butter you up for a divorce,” whatever that means). 

Caleb calls his father and complains that “None of this means anything to her,” and he’s right, but how could it be any other way? How can something she doesn’t even know is going on mean anything to her? 

Oddly, when John talks about his experience with the Love Dare, he speaks in plural – e.g., “There was a point when we had no hope either” –; unless he’s using the royal ‘We,’ he means himself and Caleb’s mother. Caleb, on the other hand, hides the whole thing from Catherine, which a) doesn’t seem like the best way to go about repairing your marriage and b) wouldn’t it work better if it were a two-sided effort? It’s not like she’s completely blameless, either. 

And now to give the Devil, or I guess Jesus, his due. Caleb is a firefighter, and he and his crew are called to the scene of a traffic accident. A woman is trapped inside the wrecked vehicle, which in turn is sitting on some tracks right on the path of an oncoming train. They are “currently unable to make contact with the train dispatcher,” so Caleb & Co. have no choice but to manfully push the car out of harm’s way.

This is all kinds of great. Not only does it put to shame many a newer, much more expensive film (is it an actual train? I’m not going to go out on a limb that it is, but if it’s CGI, then it’s the best damn CGI train I’ve ever seen), but it makes me care about the characters because I can believe they truly are firefighters putting their lives on the line – quite literally, in this case. 

Now, if only the movie had been about firefighting instead of a loveless marriage that avoids ending up in divorce thanks to a little ménage à dieu.",4.0
14441,"Michael Keaton puts in a great dramatic performance in this movie, at a time when his star was definitely rising. This movie was released the same year as Beetlejuice, and the year before Batman. Kathy Bates also excels as Charlie.

Keaton’s Money manager character Daryl has gamed the system to steal client funds, and even as his drug addiction careens towards bottom, he uses a private rehab center as a shield against being found by the authorities. As he becomes involved with Bates’ character Charlie, who he meets while in rehab, he begins to take his sobriety seriously, perhaps more so than his new girlfriend does herself. There are touches of humor and Daryl’s charm to break up the more serious moments. At one point Daryl encourages her to use a script to talk to her previous boyfriend on the phone. She gives it a try, she shows Daryl the sheet and repeats the ugly profane response she receives, telling him she doesn’t see that on there as a possible response.

The movie builds up to a short speech by Daryl that is heartfelt and powerful. The details are brutal at time, and probably therefore accurate, and well worth watching. It carries a message with it, but isn’t merely a message movie. Back when it came out and moved to HBO and DVD, I watched it multiple times. It might be time to watch it again.",9.0
14442,"Ella Enchanted is a whimsical fairy tale that manages to stand out, even if it doesn’t quite reach perfection. The first act does a great job introducing the characters, setting up the plot, and establishing the unique charm of this world. The second act keeps a solid pace, building on the adventure and humor, and it all leads to a satisfying climax in the final act. While the cinematography and editing aren't flawless, they don’t detract from the experience either, they're just there, doing their job without standing out.

What really sets this movie apart is its message about consent, autonomy, and freedom. These themes hit differently today than they did in 2004. Sure, the whimsical elements might feel over-the-top or gimmicky at times, but they also give the movie a unique personality.

14444,"Weak watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend except for HUGE Rugrats fans.

As the origin story for Dill Pickles, it very clearly is going to deal with ""Where do babies come from?"", but I think this is the closest the Rugrats franchise has come to addressing death with its audience.

I don't think the nostalgia I had for Rugrats was strong enough.  I'm seeing all these characters I loved, and just feeling nothing.  I'm hearing these (fantastic, voice-acting) ladies doing baby voice, and I've seen other movies where ladies do baby voice and they're just not nearly as long as this one.

I might have been able to get into the movie as it actually has a decent story (thought it focuses on the parents more than I'm used to), but they decided to play with rules that involve how babies talk.  They clearly present new-born babies that not only talk, but talk eloquently about ""Missing their old womb"" (sounds like a baby saying ""room"").  Dill, barely talks.  in fact, he talks to the babies like the babies would talk to the adults, and they refer to him as a baby.

While they should be toddlers and speaking a lot more than they should, part of the premise is that they're babies that talk to each other, but not adults.  It almost paints the picture that Dill was born retarded, but refuses to address it, even if it applies it directly.

It really broke the movie for me, as it's the chief mechanic behind the babies' A story line that is the basis for the parents' B story line.",4.0

That's largely down to the enthusiastic ""Erwann"" (Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet) who takes this complex but amusing look at the nature of human relationships full circle. Most of the musical numbers don't translate so well into English - the scanning and rhymes can sound a bit contrived, but the gist is there as the songs infill the narrative with some quite emotionally charged scenarios played out amidst the scenery of Paris. It can be cheesy at times, but it's essentially a story about the resilience of the human spirit to reboot and find new love where an old one has gone. Garrel is on good form here, some of his facial expressions just have to be seen as his character attempts to muddle through determined not to take the more obvious routes to happiness - despite himself, half the time.

14451,"Given my Scandinavian origin and being a bit of a fan of all kinds of science fiction, fantasy, action and horror movies I of course had to have Dead Snow in my collection. Last Saturday me and my son got around to watch it.

Dead Snow is a pretty classical teenage-group-gets-into-big-mess-with-supernatural-beings kind of horror movie. In this particular case a group of teenagers goes for a hike in the Norwegian mountains where they camp in cabin. Not very original of course but what the heck, it is a zombie horror movie so…

One thing that makes the movie a bit original is that it is not so totally over the top with foul language and insane consumption of all kinds of drugs as the standard Hollywood crap. These teenagers actually behave fairly normally drinking a few beers and having a good time. Well that is until the mysterious stranger, who is in the movie just to set up the mood, shows up and tells his story about a unusually cruel Nazi officer and his men. Of course we all know where things are going from there…

Here the movie starts to follow the usual recipe for these kind of movies. Naturally one of the teenagers needs to take care of some natural needs and separates himself from the rest of the party. Then follows the obligatory boy and girl having sex scene. This time in a old-fashioned Scandinavian “skithus” separated from the actual cabin. Anyone who has ever used one of these (I have and they stink) would know that you have to be pretty horny, drunk or both to have sex in one of those. Anyway, that was one less teenager in the party.

Slowly the zombies become more frequent and the dire situation the party is in becomes more and more evident. As the zombies become more frequent so does the gory sequences and eventually the movie turns more into a comedy than a horror movie. I have to say that the Tommy Wirkola have little to learn from his Hollywood counterparts when it comes to horror movie violence. Body parts, external as well as internal, flies around like there was no tomorrow. Which for most of the characters involved is exactly the way it is.

On the whole this movie was one part classical horror movie and one part comedy and I found it quite entertaining but you have to be into these kinds of movies to feel that way of course.",7.0

When the planet Akir is threatened by a galactic tyrant (John Saxon), a young man with no experience in warfare (Richard Thomas) ventures into space to enlist the aid of several mercenaries (George Peppard, Robert Vaughn, Morgan Woodward, etc.).

""Battle Beyond the Stars"" (1980) meshes the space-oriented science-fiction of Star Trek (the Original Series and the 1979 movie) with the space fantasy of Star Wars for a colorful interplanetary adventure on a Roger Corman budget. The protagonist’s planet is called Akir and the denizens Akira because the basic plot was taken from Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai” (which, of course, was also the basis for “The Magnificent Seven”).

On the female front, Darlanne Fluegel is noteworthy as Nanelia, the potential mate of our young hero (Thomas). Meanwhile stunning Sybil Danning works well as Saint-Exmin of the Valkyrie warriors, albeit hammy. Julia Duffy can be observed as one of the Akira.

This was one of the first fairly big theatrical films to be scored by James Horner (although he previously did “Humanoids from the Deep” the same year), which paved the way for his notable career (think “Wolfen,” “Star Trek II,” “Star Trek III,” “Cocoon,” “Aliens,” “Field of Dreams,” “Glory” and so on).

Corman’s $2 million budget was mostly spent on the salaries of Peppard and Vaughn, but he had to up his game with the special effects to compete with the new standards set by “Star Wars” (which cost $11 million), “Alien” ($11 million) and “Star Trek: The Motion Picture” ($35 million). Sure, the F/X aren’t as good as those movies, technically speaking, but they’re quite effective (and fun) all things considered, not to mention superior to “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century” (the theatrical movie that was also the pilot for the TV series), which had $3.5 million to work with.

It was very profitable at the box office and deservedly so since it’s all-around entertaining. You could say that it was the low-budget precursor to the Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy flicks of modern times.

It runs 1 hour, 43 minutes and was shot at Corman's own studio in Venice, California, his ""renowned lumberyard facility.”

14462,"This remake was always going to struggle to match the excellent 1962 version, and although it is not nearly as compelling, it is still an half decent attempt. Liev Schreiber is acclaimed Gulf War veteran and now Congressman ""Raymond Shaw"" who is very much in the running for Vice-President of the USA - egged on by his even more ambitious Senator mother (Meryl Streep). Meantime, his wartime captain ""Marco"" (Denzel Washington) is recovering from an injury sustained during an ambush - only he is struggling to reconcile his memories of that event with those being put forward by ""Shaw"" and, almost verbatim, by his fellow soldiers. Upon more detailed investigation, ""Marco"" stumbles upon the most unique of conspiracies that calls him to question not just his own sanity, but the nature of events both past and present. The more he digs, the more doors close before him and pretty soon both he and we know that there is some sort of conspiracy that goes right to the heart of American democracy. The story has been updated from the original and that helps it to stand on it's own a bit more. Washington is effective, as is Schreiber as the plot thickens and the prospects of a terrifying form of psychological warfare begin to loom large, presenting us with a story of manipulation and power-lust that is distinctly Machiavellian. Meryl Streep does OK, but sadly her's is the role that comes off worst by comparison with Angela Lansbury from first time round. The former is undoubtedly an accomplished actress, but somehow she doesn't quite exude the same degree of toxic charm. It also really does take it's time to get going, but once in it's stride it offers us quite an intriguing, if wordy, look at just how the American political establishment might work, and how it might, equally, be up for shrewd exploitation.

14469,"Bullet is a shot in the dark; a stray bullet that almost hits its mark. Almost. It's hard to screw up a film with Mickey Rourke, Tupac Shakur, Adrien Brody, and Ted Levine – hard, but not impossible. One of the most disappointing aspects of Bullet is that Shakur, the rare musician with a truly solid screen presence, only appears in a handful of scenes – which is still more than enough for him to steal the movie –, and only shares a couple of them with Rourke. One can only wonder if his death that same year had something to do with this.

Butch 'Bullet' Stein (Rourke) is out on parole after serving an eight-year sentence. On his first day out, Bullet stabs Flaco (Manny Perez), who works for drug dealer Tank (Shakur), in the eye. Apparently, stabbing people in the eye is Bullet's trademark, and Tank is one of his previous victims. So why is his nickname Bullet, then? And why does Tank wear an eye patch? Under it, he either has a glass eye, or a glassy eye, but an eye nonetheless.

It’s symptomatic of this script, in which Rourke had a hand, that the consequences fall very short of the magnitude of the actions that provoke them. In addition to Tank's eye, we have Butch's younger brother Ruby’s (Brody) hand. Ruby is an aspiring graffiti artist whose “drawing hand” is impaled with a knife, for which Butch is indirectly to blame.

This incident not only does not result in friction between the brothers, but it doesn’t prevent Ruby from painting a huge mural of his hand with a blade going through it, of all things. Basically, this event belongs in a first draft, not in the finished movie.

All things considered, I have mixed feelings about this film. Tupac is easily the best thing in it; when he's not there we expect him to show up, and when he shows up, all eyes are on him (you’ll excuse the obvious reference). The filmmakers should have given us a lot more of Shakur, or a lot less.

Rourke, on the other hand, gives a deliberately lethargic and morose performance, befitting the unmotivated Butch – who is only jolted out of his drug-induced stupor to commit petty crimes to get money to buy more drugs –, and in keeping with the scattered, disjointed, and episodic nature of much of the film. The highlight of Rourke's performance is a great scene in which Butch warns two young men he mugged earlier in the story of the dangers of ending up like him.

This Butch material, which could have been the American answer to Trainspotting, is set against the more straightforward Tank subplot, so that we are left with two different stories running perpendicular, rather than parallel, to each other, and when they intersect is more of a train wreck than a junction.",5.0

14536,"I have watched several romantic comedies lately to clear them from my Netflix watch list. As I have said many times in my reviews, I like them because the wit, humor and yes romance, is something I strive to put into the novels I write. So I tend to rate rom-coms more gently than some genres that have different goals. 

Having said all that, this is the only romantic comedy that has really disappointed me lately. Partly it is due to the utter stereotyping of the Minnesota way of speaking, even more extreme than Fargo had been. Plus the rather crass shoehorning of religion into the plot. Hey, I am an atheist, but the faith of one of the characters seemed to be a rather shallow way of providing - well I won’t say back story - just details about her I guess. 

But mostly I felt let down by the writing. Makes sense I suppose as I dabble in writing myself. The effort seemed lazy in a way. The plot features a smooth, ambitious corporate city slicker coming to a backwater town to close a local plant or at least reduce the work force. Gee, we haven’t seen that before, have we? It is right up there with the chestnut of a local group putting on a play to raise money to save their beloved theater about to be torn down. 

There also didn’t seem to be much chemistry between some of the characters, which sometimes can save a movie for me. And the ending, which I won’t describe, was dropped on us viewers by the time-honored method of a deus ex machine, a gift from the gods unsupported by plot lead-up after Lucy Hill disappeared from the story.

It is a wonder I am writing this at all, because I don’t write reviews of movies I don’t finish watching. A brief “I gave up after ten minutes — don’t bother!” Isn’t a review; it is letting off steam. Just rate it and don’t write a review, guys.

14537,"**It's a film that might scare modern audiences a bit, but it deserves the opportunity we want to give it.**

In addition to having a very strong film industry, Japan is a country with a very rich past that we in the West tend to devalue. A somewhat ethnocentric attitude, more typical of small minds. For a long time, the Japanese were a people divided by several feudal princes who fought among themselves, disputing power and regional influence. It was in this context, moreover, that the first contact between the Japanese and the Portuguese took place, the first Westerners to disembark, demonstrably (Marco Polo speaks of the Japanese, but he probably never went there), on the islands of Japan, where they took the first firearm, the Christian faith and a strong cultural influence: even today, in the Japanese language, there are hundreds of words directly imported from Portuguese.

The film that brought me here tells us about one of the most fascinating traditional figures of Japan: the samurai, a warrior similar, in essence, to the European knight. They were educated people who were willing to live off the war, as paid mercenaries. In a land where each feudal lord wages war for himself, with his own troops and against his neighbors, it was not difficult to live off war. It would be difficult to live in peace! The samurai had a code of conduct, the Bushido, which dictated rules according to which they guided their lives, seeking to live and die with honor. Honor was more important than life and therefore, in certain situations, it was expected that the samurai knew how to die and was willing to do so, even if by his own hands, in a suicide ritual.

The film begins when a samurai, left unemployed by a long peace, turns to an old man and asks to be allowed to die. In response, he hears a story that occurred some time before, and in which a samurai in the same situation made an identical request in the expectation of receiving money, and ended up having to commit suicide, and with a wooden weapon. The film then reveals an important fact: this first samurai is the father-in-law of the man who killed himself, and who wanted money to feed his sick wife and son. And in fact that warrior is not there in order to simply die, but in order to avenge the son-in-law wronged by human hypocrisy.

The film is quite dense, and the fact that it is so different from Western cinema and, even more so, in black and white, can quite scare the current public. However, it is worth resisting this impulse to reject it and giving the film a chance. It's very well done, it has a pretty good story, which is nothing behind big Hollywood hits. The script takes advantage of the situation to expose the brutality of the rigor imposed on the samurai by means of a moral code so absurdly demanding that it ended up being inhumane. Contrary to what happens in some films, even western ones, this film does a good historical contextualization of the story it tells us, not being too difficult to understand what is at stake. I'm not the best person to talk about the director or the actors, I don't know them, but I can say that we have the participation of Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoshiro Aoki and Akira Ishihama. On a technical level, I think it's impossible to avoid noticing the quality of the sets and filming locations, as well as the sharpness and quality of the cinematography.",7.0
14549,"**_Night train to avaricious terror_**

Something tragic happens on an American train with few passengers on Christmas night. The conductor (Danny Glover) and two other passengers (Leelee Sobieski and Steve Zahn) come up with a dubious plan that they think will improve their lives, but how wrong they are. Matthias Schweighöfer is on hand as an assistant to the conductor.

""Night Train"" (2009) is a suspense/thriller that takes place almost entirely on a train. The set-up is the same as “Terror Train” (1980), but this isn’t a slasher, although there’s a little bit of that. It’s more Hitchcockian, not to mention more compelling. Think “A Simple Plan” (1998) on a train, albeit with a MacGuffin and a mystical element. Speaking of the latter, this would’ve worked better without that angle (for me, anyway).

Despite losing points for that and the use of cartoonish CGI for the train barreling down the tracks at 200 MPH (which didn’t bother me, personally), “Night Train” is an entertaining ride highlighted by the stunning Leelee in her prime. It’s not great like “Runaway Train” (1985) or even as good as ""Horror Express"" (1972) and ""Train"" (2008), but I’d put it on par with ""Beyond the Door III"" (1989) and “Howl” (2015). 

Although a throwaway flick, it delivers the goods if you’re in the mood for a train flick.  

The film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot in Sofia, Bulgaria.

14550,"""The Dream Team"" is a very entertaining and well paced comedy throughout until the very end. It gets lots of mileage out of a simple central idea and the idea itself seems to have been inspired by the fishing trip episode in Ken Kesey's ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" and in this instance, as with the 1962 novel, it is an authorised outing fully sanctioned - albeit reluctantly - by the senior staff at the Cedarbrook Psychiatric Hospital. This film could have been nothing more than a shallow comedy featuring an intriguing central idea whose potential is never fully realised or developed upon, so it is refreshing to discover this film doesn't suffer that unfortunate fate and indeed the complete opposite is actually the case.",8.0
14551,"Some things a man has to do, so he does 'em.

This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 ""The Gun That Won The West"" - To cowman, outlaw, peace officer or soldier, the Winchester 73 was a treasured possession. An Indian would sell his soul to own one...

Winchester '73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo that would go on to create a run of superior Westerns that added a new psychological depth to the genre. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam, who is pursuing the man who killed his father. Riding into Dodge City with his trusty friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally), the man he wants. But with Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) having taken all the guns from those entering the town, both men are unable to have the shoot-out that they are ready for. The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin eventually wins. But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and skips town fast. As Lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle, the rifle will changed hands a number of times, with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches.

Very much a benchmark for what became known as the so-called ""psychological Western"", Winchester '73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past. Though shot in black and white (the only one of the duos Westerns that was) the landscapes are still breath taking feasts for the eyes. The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City. It's just the starting point that would see Mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states.

Stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of America's finest and most versatile actors. The support cast isn't too bad either. Shelley Winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the always great Dan Duryea add further class to proceedings. There's even bit parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson in here, though the latter playing an Indian brave is a stretch too far.

Originally the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who even had the script ready to run. But Lang walked away from it, something that proved to be a blessing for Western fans. For as great as a director that Lang was, with Mann directing (and with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hands) it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre. Not only with the further efforts that Mann & Stewart produced, but also in who they influenced. The likes of Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller were all taking notes, and gleefully for the Western purists, they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further.

A big hit at the box office back on release, Winchester '73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age. 9/10",9.0
14551,"_**Dynamic James Stewart Western with a noir tinge**_

The prize rifle of a drifter (James Stewart) is stolen by his nemesis (Stephen McNally), apprehended by a gun-trader (John McIntire), involved in a cavalry vs. Indian clash, winds up in the hands of a man who struggles with cowardice (Charles Drake) before being swiped by a charismatic outlaw (Dan Duryea). Meanwhile Lin McAdam (Stewart) pursues it with his faithful pardner (Millard Mitchell).   

While ""Winchester ‘73"" (1950) was shot in flat B&W, it’s a compelling action-packed Western with noir touches highlighted by the notable cast, which also includes Will Geer and Shelly Winters (when she was young, fit and voluptuous, not to mention spunky). Also look for Rock Hudson as the lead brave Young Bull and Tony Curtis as a besieged cavalry trooper.  

The movie throws in Dodge City, Kansas, and a surprisingly congenial, almost bumbling (and too-old) Wyatt Earp (Geer) even though it’s clear that the film was shot in southern Arizona. For instance, the saguaro cactus is native to the Sonoran Desert and not within 800 miles of Dodge City. But Tascosa, Texas, works okay within the framework of the Southwest, I guess. Basically, you have to ignore some misleading geography and a dubious Wyatt Earp to enjoy the picture.
  
The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot mainly in southern Arizona with studio stuff done at Universal Studios, California, with some exterior shots of Zion National Park, Utah.

14554,"Hateful subject given a master class telling.

Produced by Dore Schary out of MGM, Bad Day at Black Rock is directed by John Sturges and stars Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan, Anne Francis, Dean Jagger, Walter Brennan, John Ericson, Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin. It's adapted by Don McGuire and Millard Kaufman from the story ""Bad Day at Hondo"" written by Howard Breslin. It's shot on location in CinemaScope and Eastman Color at Lone Pine, Death Valley & Alabama Hills in California, with William C. Mellor on photography and André Previn scoring the music.

A classy production that combines elements of Westerns and film noir, Bad Day at Black Rock deals with racism and all the hate and bully tactics that come with such a vile subject. It tells the story of a mysterious one armed stranger, John J. Macreedy (Tracy), who arrives at a tiny isolated town in a desert of the Southwest United States in search of a Japanese-American man. From the moment he arrives he is met with hostility and mistrust. Over the course of the day Macreedy picks apart the town to uncover the secret that the towns folk had hoped had gone away forever.

From the opening sequence of a bright red train rushing towards us, it's evident that we are in the modern day West. It's just after World War II and the horse trails of the old West are now frequented by jeeps and cars. Yet the hallmarks of the old West exists and thrives because of the inhabitants of Black Rock. An ignorant group of people consisting of bullies, drunks and the head in the sand weak willed type. Yet even though the film is set mostly in the blazing sun, in a barren one horse Western town that time forgot, the film exudes a film noir sensibility. Dark secrets from the past weigh heavy on the shoulders of the towns' big players - and Tracy's High Noon like situation is moodily paced by the wily Sturges. In fact, that a film with so little ""gun play"" action can be so tense is actually no mean feat, with him yet again directing an ensemble cast to great effect.

Tracy is at his best when he is as he is here, playing subdued. Here he is a thinking man's protagonist, calm and reflective in the face of constant hostility. That he is facing an impressive line up of heavies really brings home just how thoughtful a performance Tracy gives in the piece. Robert Ryan does yet another fine turn as a complicated villain whose rage is bubbling away under the surface. Borgnine and Marvin are memorably vile as his right hand thugs, Dean Jagger as the drunken cowardly sheriff manages to pang the heart and Walter Brennan is his usual solid scene influencing self. Anne Francis adds the glamour but really - and sadly - it's a nondescript role that the film could easily have survived without.

Clocking in at just 81 minutes the film never outstays its welcome. It looks great on home format issue, and for those interested in commentary tracks, this one comes with a very good one from Dana Polan. Anyone who has not seen this film should try and seek it out. It was considered controversial back on release but now can be viewed as a smart message movie about racial tolerance. Tight, taut and expertly directed and acted, Bad Day At Black Rock is an important film from the 50s that still rings the bells loudly even today. 8/10",8.0

An affable mall officer in New Jersey (Kevin James) takes his job seriously while taking care of his daughter and pursuing a cute kiosk attendant (Jayma Mays). When the mall is taken over by a gang of organized thugs, can Paul Blart rise to the challenge?

Whether or not you’ll like “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” (2009) will depend on if you appreciate Kevin James and his goofy, unprofane brand of humor, as depicted in The King of Queens, “Zookeeper” (2011) and “True Memoirs of an International Assassin” (2016). While it’s not as good as “Zookeeper,” it’s not far off. After the first 25 minutes or so you’ll find yourself engrossed in Paul’s life; you understand him and like him. You feel for the man as he gazes longingly at a receipt with the handwritten name of his romantic interest. And you’ll root for him and laugh when a serious threat engulfs the mall.

Keir O'Donnell plays Paul’s greenhorn partner, Veck. He’s reminiscent of a young Tim Roth. In other news, Mays has the cutest wide-eyed face.

The low acting level of the youngsters did take me out a bit, no dislike to Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon, obviously, but they aren't the best. Though they aren't helped by the dialogue for them, which doesn't feel natural at all. It's written in a way that is simply to tell the viewer about what's happening.

Meantime, though, he is investing a cool £250,000 in one last scheme to raise him millions and hopefully set him on the straight and narrow. The thing is, his lieutenants - led by “Ratter” (Kenny Doughty) are bored living on what they perceive to be the scraps. They know that there’s way more cash to be made if they start dealing hard drugs. “Ged” wants no truck with this, but egged on by his pal “Paul” (Philip Olivier), “Ratter” is determined that he will get his way - by hook or by crook. With the pressure mounting on their boss, revolution brewing amongst the troops and the deadly Serbs waiting in the wings to muscle in on this lucrative market, it’s going to take all “Ged” can muster to save himself and his family from the new world order. On the face of it, this is a solid gangster story but as to it’s execution - well that is just weak. Loads of faux-Scouse accents pepper the over-scripted drama; loads more Anglo-Saxon expletives don’t make these actors into plausible hard-men and the whole thing looks like it’s a low budget episode from a 1980s television series. Some of it is intentionally distasteful and on occasion that does work at illustrating just how odious, depraved and greedy some of this gang are, but so often those scenes seem here for their own gratification rather than to put any meat on the bones of these characters and at just over two hours, it takes far too long to get to anything like a sharp end about which I’d lost interest after some random sexually fluid brutality in a penthouse.

14580,"Fritz Lang deals nicely in obsession and  corruption.

Detective Dave Bannion is investigating the suicide of corrupt cop Tom Duncan. As he gets deeper, and his colleagues get nervous, his wife is inadvertently killed by a car bomb that was meant for him, he turns from mannered family man into a vengeful obsessive, the heat is most definitely coming down on those responsible.

Writer Sydney Boehm took a ""Saturday Evening Post"" serial (written by William McGiven), and crafted a tight, biting and incredibly bleak script. Handed it into director Fritz Lang's hands, who then cloaked it (along with Charles Lang's perfectly apt photography) with dripping noir nastiness. Playing out as a tale of murder, revenge and pure hatred, The Big Heat holds up now as one of the best of the dialogue driven noir pieces of the 50s.

Lang isn't concerned with showing the violence exactly, more like the reaction of our protagonists to the violence in the piece, this makes for a sort of ethereal viewing, with the sets themselves becoming integral to our characters personalities. The cast are excellent, Glenn Ford as Bannion was never better than he is here, but even he is playing second fiddle to the fabulous Gloria Grahame as Debby Marsh, a Moll who makes a decision that has very far reaching consequences. It begs the question as to why Grahame never had a far better career, for here she is one of film noir's best (anti?) heroines. Rounding out a trio of great performances are Lee Marvin as the vile and brutal Vince Stone - Marvin of course would go on from here and deliver a ream of brilliant gruff hard bastard performances.

The Ghost Breakers is a sort of sequel to Paramount's 1939 hit ""The Cat and the Canary"", also starring Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard. Directed by George Marshall (who would direct the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis 1958 remake, ""Scared Stiff"", as well) it's adapted by Walter DeLeon from the play ""The Ghost Breaker"" by Paul Dickey and Charles W. Goddard. The premise is simple, after mistakenly thinking he has shot a hoodlum type, Larry Lawrence (Hope) flees into another hotel room, that of Mary Carter (Goddard), who is packing for a trip to Cuba. Befriending her, it's not before long that Larry is on his way to Cuba as well, but Mary is under threat from shifty characters and to make matters worse, their destination castle is rumoured to be haunted and tales of zombies seem to carry some weight.

Hope and Goddard really do have a rich chemistry here and the results are excellent to say the least. They would work again for a third time a year later in ""Nothing But the Truth"". But really it's with the writing that most credit is due here. Hope of course was an excellent deliverer of a line, but first you have to have quality lines to work from, and here with DeLeon's screenplay we get some delightful stuff for Hope to work with. From Basil Rathbone to sly political leg pulling, the gags come quick and fast and compliment the visual fun as Hope, Goddard and Willie Best are all aboard the fun creeper express. Charles Lang is on photography duties and captures the eerie atmosphere of the island perfectly, while a nod of approval should go to Edith Head for her costumes.

14615,"Tormentors and the tormented given Lang's gifted touch.

Out of MGM, Fury is directed by Fritz Lang and stars Spencer Tracy and Sylvia Sidney and features Walter Abel, Bruce Cabot, Edward Ellis and Walter Brennan in support. It's adapted by Lang and Bartlett Cormack from the story ""Mob Rule"" written by Norman Krasna. Loosely based around the events that surrounded both the ""Brooke Hart"" murder in 1933 and the ""Lindbergh"" kidnapping/murder case in 1932, the story sees Tracy as Joe Wilson, an innocent man who is jailed and apparently killed in a fire started by a rampaging lynch mob. However, as the lynch mob go on trial for his murder, Joe surfaces but is twisted by thoughts of revenge on those who happily watched him burn.

Widely and rightly considered a classic, this first Hollywood outing from director Fritz Lang is a remarkable look at mob violence and one man's limit pushed to its breaking point - and then some. That Lang survived studio interference to craft such a penetrating study of injustice is a minor miracle. Fury is neatly put together as a story, the calm before the storm as Joe & Kath are brought to us as the happy face of Americana. Then it's the middle section as rumours run out of control, the dangers of idle prattling rammed home as things start to escalate out of control - culminating in the savage assault on the jail (a gusto infused action sequence indeed). Then the fall out of mob rule actions, the court case and Joe's malevolent force of vengeance, that in turn comes under scrutiny.

The film was said to have been Lang's favourite American film, which is understandable given it bares all his trademarks. The expressionistic touches, shadow play dalliances and supreme cross-cutting between tormentors and the tormented, for sure this is prime Lang, with no frame wasted. While it's no stretch of the imagination to think that Lang, having fled Nazi Germany, was pondering what he left behind as he moulded the picture together. Of the cast, Tracy is majestic as our main protagonist, while Sidney is brightly big eyed and hugely effective as the moral centre of Joe's universe.

Controversial at the time, the film has naturally lost some of that controversial power over the decades. However, as the film points out with the lynching statistics, there was once a time when inhumanity was able to rear its ugly head in the blink of an eye. Fury serves to remind two-fold that not only is it a potent social commentary, but also that it's a damn fine piece of skilled cinema. 9/10",9.0

It has a degree of violence to it, a physical and  intellectual torment that is well illustrated as the story unfolds slowly but distinctly and not in any way predictably either. This isn't a love story in any traditional guise; but there is affection and sentiment here and as we gradually learn a little of what makes ""Galoup"" tick, I felt a little immersed in his scenario.

Absolutely loved this, the 127 minute run time flew by real quick; thoroughly enjoyable. It portrays, with extra drama I'm sure, the events of Morris' real life baseball career in a fantastic way. There's great character development right from the get-go, by the conclusion I was utterly invested in Morris. He is played by Dennis Quaid, who is superb in the role. I felt every emotion of his character, best I've (currently) seen of Quaid so far.

The film does a great job at making you care for not only him, but even his high school team. Speaking of which, they did a terrific job with the casting of those guys - I felt like I was watching a bunch of real teammates; Chad Lindberg, of <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em>, is one of them. Even away from Quaid and Lindberg & Co., you still have Morris' family to feel for as well. There's many characters to get attached to, but I was very interested in all of them.

Fantastic stuff, I'd highly recommend you watch <em>'The Rookie'</em>.",9.0
14636,"Co-writer/director Scott Wiper overestimated how many people would pay to watch a webcast of ten convicts forced to fight each other to the death on a desert island, same as WWE overestimated how many people would pay to watch a movie about such a webcast. 

At least the webcast, even with its supposed 30-hour runtime, presumably doesn’t cut away from the action, such as it is, to secondary subplots and tertiary characters not on the island — it's as if Jurassic Park said, ""let's go see what's happening some place else where there are no dinosaurs.""

“Jack Conrad [Steve Austin] is awaiting the death penalty in a corrupt Central American [Salvadoran, to be exact] prison” (IMDb). So corrupt is this prison that Jack would be the first person executed in El Salvador since the early 70s. I don’t know about cruel, but that would certainly be unusual punishment.

Jack is spared this fate by Ian Breckel (Robert Mammone), a ""billionaire"" TV producer, and taken to a desolate island where he must fight to the death against nine other convicted murderers of multiple nationalities. Each has an ankle bracelet/time bomb, complete with the trusty old Red Digital Readout counting down the 30 hours mentioned above.

These bombs are the only thing that comes close to 'thinking outside the box', especially since they can be activated by removing a pin; however, the onscreen execution, as it were, leaves a lot to be desired, and even if it were done right, it would still grow old fast, considering that it's the most common method of killing (accounting for 30% of deaths among participants). 

Worst of all, Wiper unforgivably squanders the opportunity to have one of the characters amputate his own foot and use it as a makeshift grenade grenade (Nathan Jones is also in this movie, because one bald former pro wrestler apparently wasn’t enough).",1.0
14638,"When two hit men arrive in the diner of a small town, they announce their intention to the owner of killing one of his customers - former boxer ""the Swede"" (Burt Lancaster). He manages to convince them that he would not be coming in that night, and so they leave to track him down. His friend, who was tied up in the diner rushes to warn him, but he does nothing - he invites the fate that we see, right from the beginning of the film. Why though? Why didn't he run? It transpires that he had a modest life insurance policy and so investigator ""Reardon"" (Edmond O'Brien) tries to track down the beneficiary and piece together a story of robbery, betrayal and duplicity - to all of which the character of ""Kitty"" (Ava Gardner) proves central. This is a superior film noir, with Lancaster and O'Brien on great form as the flashbacks gradually fill in the gaps and with the help of ""Lt. Lubinsky"" (Sam Levene) they discovers what truly happened. Ava Gardner's character features quite sparingly, but potently when she is on screen - manipulating and twisting as she manoeuvres the men around her with consummate skill. The pace is measured, the story takes it's time to develop and that helps make this quite a compelling drama that puts a little more meat on the bones of the original Hemingway short story. The photography is intense, using the light and shade dramatically, and the score from the maestro Miklós Rósza adds a richness to the gritty look of the film too. Burt Lancaster's first major screen role, but it's O'Brien who does most of the heavy lifting here, and he does it well!",7.0

""Solstice"" (2008) was made by the creator of ""The Blair Witch Project"", Daniel Myrick, and is a more conventional horror flick. Like ""Blair,"" ""Solstice"" takes the subtle route with the creep factor and the typical trappings of slasher or quasi-slasher flicks; so stay away if you need serious gore, sex and nudity with your horror.

The film runs 90 minutes and the first hour plays out like myriad other monster/ghost movies -- a group of youths venture to some secluded area to party and tensions increase as the creep factor increases. What separates ""Solstice"" from, say, most of the Friday the 13th sequels, besides lack of gore, is the serious and realistic vibe of the proceedings. While this is welcomed by me, it also makes for a less entertaining viewing -- for the first hour, that is.

The third act is where everything comes together and there's almost a 'Wow' factor as you realize what's really going on and what happened, etc.

While the cast are all no-names, except Amanda Seyfried (who wasn't too well-known at the time), they're effective enough. They coulda done better with the women, but the main protagonist is decent, Elisabeth Harnois.

14664,"It was made in '81 and is actually a pretty solid police film. It's not great, it's not Chinatown, but it also is pretty far from horrible.

The dialogue is absolutely fantastic, and even in the throw away moments, there is a humor that seems very human. It's Hollywood sharp and witty to the point where it's almost too good to be realistic, it's just, human. There are a lot of little throw away conversations that seem like the kind of thing you'd hear in your everyday life.

And that adds a nice touch of realism to what is otherwise a cop film, and those are always pretty unrealistic.

The sound track is a little dated, a little 70s Adult film in places, but that was just a trope of the era and even great films like Three Days of the Condor had that 70s had that ""I expect John Holmes to walk in any minute now"" kind of music... but then it also had the cliche 80s sex scene instrumentals. So it feels like the merging of two eras and, audioly, it can't really decide if it wants to be 70s or 80s.

And then it has crooning that seems like it fits better in a Sean Connery era 007 film.

I guess what I'm saying is that, if there is a flaw, it's the sound track.

Essentially what it is though is a solid cop film that is bucking for 1970s gritty and realistic, but is still, ultimately, as over the top and unrealistic as most police thrillers. It's a very enjoyable film to watch.... despite the music.",10.0

14674,"Another Intelligent Western from Anthony Mann.

Link Jones is on his way to Fort Worth to hire a schoolteacher, having left his wife and children behind, Link appears to be the epitome of the simple honest man. However, the train he is on is robbed by outlaws, thus meaning that Link's past and his dubious family ties are all careering towards a day of reckoning.

This was Anthony Mann's second to last foray into the Western genre, and perhaps his most clinical as regards a structured tale of men as complicated as they are conflicted? I always find with Mann's Westerns that a sense of doom hangs heavy, there are very few directors in Western cinema history who have this knack of filling the viewer with such a pervading feeling of unease. Here we have Gary Cooper as Link, on the surface an amiable man, but the sequence of events see him thrust back into a life he thought had long since gone. The term that a leopard never changes its spots sits rather well, but here we find Mann fleshing out his lead character with an acknowledgement that a former life has passed, with Cooper perfectly transcending this well scripted arc.

The striking thing about it though, is that Mann's characters are not the quintessential good versus bad characters, these are just men with their own individual hang ups, they all are fallible human beings, which is something that surely we all can identity with. The acting across the board here is top notch, Cooper is excellent, replacing Mann's stock Western muse, James Stewart, he cements his earthy and identifiable worth wholesale. Lee J. Cobb actually is the glue that holds the film together, his portrayal of Dock Tobin perfectly plays alongside Cooper's emotive showing of Link Jones's confliction. Negatively though, we are asked to believe that Gary Cooper is Lee J. Cobb's nephew, with a difference of just ten years between the two men that has to be a casting error one feels.

Still, the film comes highly recommended, the intelligence and dark atmosphere of the piece marks it out for worthwhile emotional investment, whilst Cooper's two main fights (both different) are seriously great cinema. 8.5/10",8.0

His uncle ""Dock"" - Lee J. Cobb - is determined to lead him back down the path of violence. The psychological nature of this gives it a little more depth - sadly, though, neither Cobb, Cooper nor Julie London as ""Billie"" really gel together or engage convincingly, the dialogue is a bit stodgy and the ending, though quite violent, is poorly predictable. The photography is suitably grand and it's quite excitingly scored, but this is still not the best.",6.0

Lucy & Jerry Warriner strain their marriage by suspecting each other of cheating, so much so, a day in court leaves them with a 90 day prelude to a divorce. Sure enough, though, love never quite runs as expected, and can indeed be a truly complex thing, especially when the other parties involved are human, a cheeky cat, and a rather smart and astute canine!

The Awful Truth is tagged as part of the wonderful genre that encompasses the screwball comedy, and although to a degree that genre placement is true, I do believe that those not particularly fond of the high octane scattergun comedies from the genre, will certainly find this offering far more appealing with its pacing and lighthearted production values.

The Awful Truth began life as a stage play in the early 20s, and was then adapted to film twice previously in 1925 & 1929, but here for the 1937 version, director Leo McCarey (Academy Award winner Best Director) improves the story big time with sharp witty dialogue and an appreciative knack for letting his actors improvise at free will in the name of comedy. Taking the lead roles of the Warriner's is Cary Grant & Irene Dunne, and it's a great pairing as they positively bounce of each other with almost carefree abandon. Adding greatly to the frivolity is Ralph Bellamy as tone death country bumpkin love interest Daniel, Alex D'Arcy as the suave but naive Armand, and Cecil Cunningham as the wry Aunt Patsy. It's a seamless enjoyable romp containing many laugh out loud sequences, and as much as the outcome my never be in doubt, the ending is still a joy to behold. Even if the cat and the clock invariably steal the show!

This is the story of Lord John Morgan, an honest earthy person who is captured by the Sioux in 1825. Abused and treated as an animal he comes to adapt to his life in order to survive. Enduring torture and oppression he must earn their respect in order to be accepted as part of their tribe.

The white man as part of a Sioux tribe story was given a major shot in the arm with Kevin Costner's Oscar bagger, Dances With Wolves in 1990. This picture came out some twenty years before Costner's stylish picture but the two films couldn't be further apart in terms of story telling. Here in Elliot Silverstein's picture, the scenery and scope is certainly lush, but the niceties stop there for this is a harsh, at times painful, story with realism dripping from each frame. Silverstein wanted to get as close as he could to the facts of the Sioux way of life, even bringing in a Sioux historian to oversee the production.

The Sioux are painted on both sides of the canvas, on one side we are shown them to be violent, even sadistic, but Silverstein also portrays them as an intelligent race driven on by intense loyalty to their ways and culture. Richard Harris plays our main protagonist and has a clear license to act with immense verve and vigour, it's a memorable turn that lingers long after the credits roll. Hurting the film is a twee romance between Morgan and the Chiefs daughter (Judith Anderson) and Jean Gascon's fluctuating accents start to grate entering the film's last quarter. But really the plus points far outweigh the little irritants in the piece. The editing from Philip W. Anderson & Michael Kahn is like a whirling paean to hallucinations, and some scenes are from the top draw, most notably the Vow To The Sun ritual that literally is painful to watch. A Man Called Horse may well be of its time, but it's certainly a very interesting and highly intelligent film. 7/10",7.0

It was really enjoyable to watch Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn in this movie. Both were well suited for their roles and I have always liked them as actors. Maybe this is just some nostalgic connection I have though since I am sure that their performance would not wind them any Oscars today.

The story is as classical as the movie. The young brat of a wealthy cattle owner gets himself in big trouble and said cattle owner tries to prevent him, being the only son, getting what he deserves. Unfortunately the other side is not only as tough as the cattle owner but also happens to be the law. The story is well executed by John Sturges. It has the usual elements that you would expect from this kind of movie, two men posturing against each other, a bad guy who also ends up being a prisoner, a girlie torn between the two men, a few gun and fist fights and of course a grand finale.

Matt Morgan (Kirk Douglas) and Craig Belden (Anthony Quinn) are old friends who went on different career paths. Morgan is a law man, settled down with his Indian wife and had a son. Belden is a cattle baron and self appointed ruler of the town of Gun Hill. When Morgan's wife is raped and murdered, he follows the only clue available to him; one of Belden's saddles. At first he hopes that Belden's saddle had been stolen, but he quickly finds that the horrendous crime has been committed by Rick (Earl Holliman), Belden's son. But upon arresting Rick, Morgan finds that Belden, and the town under his control, except Belden's on off gal, Linda (Carolyn Jones), are not keen to let him leave on the Last Train From Gun Hill. 

Directed by John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven), Last Train From Gun Hill is adapted by James Poe (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) from a story written by Les Crutchfield. Photography is by Charles Lang and the score is provided by Dimitri Tiomkin. 

The first thing that springs to mind upon completing a viewing of this film; is that the tale has been dealt with far better in the Western genre before. Thus Sturges' film holds no surprises at all. Only two years prior we had had the infinitely superior Delmer Daves piece, 3:10 To Yuma. However, if a story has good thematics, then why not take another wander down a well trodden moody path? Indeed, and Sturges' film is nicely constructed pretty much across the board. With its blend of psychological undertones and action, helped by the mostly impressive cast, it ends up being an entertaining Oater. This in spite of not going a little darker when perhaps it should have. In fact, Sturges, a fine director for sure, is possibly too aware of keeping the film sprightly for a general wide appeal audience, something that can also be said about Tiomkin's score. It's a bit distracting when a tension mounting sequence is scored with funky uplift music! While Lang's photography is interesting, in a good way, using nice long shots in his scorched landscape exteriors.

But the rancher & his cronies mean to stop it, whatever the cost. Carolyn Jones is on hand.   

Directed by John Sturges, “Last Train from Gun Hill” (1959) is similar in tone to Sturges’ “Gun Fight at the O.K. Corral” mixed with elements of “3:10 to Yuma” (both from 1957), but it’s not as good as either. Quinn’s character is exasperatingly oafish in that he refuses to hold his grossly foolish son accountable for rape/murder. The fact that the woman was an AmerIndian is irrelevant.    

The showdown in the final act is also unrealistic. Not to mention there’s too much sitting around and the flick seems longer than it is. If you can get past these flaws, it’s an okay 50’s Western with two notable stars.

Although beautiful in its own unique way, the setting is too one-dimensional for my tastes, but the acting is convincing. Anyone interested in gritty realistic survival films should find something to appreciate. It features the mundaneness of ""Limbo"" (1999), but lacks the thrills of ""The Edge"" (1997).

Millionairess, Violet Venable is obsessed with her now dead son, Sebastian. Sebastian met his untimely end whilst on vacation with his cousin Catharine, an end that has sent Catharine almost to the edge of insanity. Violet, very concerned about Catharine and her hurtful ramblings, enlists brain surgeon Dr. Cukrowicz to see if he will perform a lobotomy on the poor girl, but as Cukrowicz digs deeper, motives and facts come crashing together to reveal something far more worrying.

As one expects from a Tennessee Williams adaptation, this picture is very talky, perhaps borderline annoyingly so? Yet it has to be said that for those willing to invest the time with it, the pay off is well worth the wait. Suddenly Last Summer is an odd mix of campy melodrama and Gothic horror leanings, a mix that personally doesn't quite hit all the intended spots. It could have been so different, though, for if Gore Vidal and Joseph Mankiewicz had been given free rein back in this day of code restrictions, well the picture would surely have been close to masterpiece status. This adaptation only gives us little snippets on which to feed, we are aware of the homosexuality of the departed Sebastian, and other hints that come our way include incest, sadism and dubious class issues, but ultimately such strong material is never fully formed.

Elizabeth Taylor owns the picture as Catharine, sultry with heaving bosom, she does an excellent line in borderline nut case, all woe is me martyrdom and her final scenes are what pays the viewer off for their patience. Katharine Hepburn plays Violet and manages to chew the scenery and spit it out, it's an elegant performance but you really want more than we actually get! Montgomery Clift is the good doctor, not one of his better performances because he isn't asked to expand the character, just say his lines right, look baleful from time to time and play off Taylor's lead, job done really.

14698,"Howard Hawks defined a good film as “three good scenes and no bad ones.” Suddenly, Last Summer has four very good scenes dominated by one of the two great great actresses who play the leads – or, in one instance, both.

These are long scenes but never boring, and we are at all times bolted to our seats, our eyes glued to the screen; Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor give different, even contrasting performances – the one as a crazy, rich, old lady who feigns sanity, the other as a traumatized yet sane young woman who is “classified as violent” –, but the result is in either case nothing short of magnetic : we can’t stop looking at Taylor, and we dare not look away from Hepburn (after all of her scenes had been shot, Hepburn reportedly spat in the faces of director Joseph L. Mankiewicz and producer Sam Spiegel).

We are drawn toward, and gravitate around, the two of them – not unlike the other characters (as few as one and as many as the rest of the main cast in any given scene), who are little more than bystanders, the actors who portray them VIP audience members fortunate enough to watch a pair of masters of the craft from up-close.

Actually, there is one other presence looming large over the proceedings – that of Sebastian Venable, Hepburn’s only son and Taylor’s cousin, whose implied homosexuality Hepburn hopes to cover up by having Taylor lobotomized by Montgomery Clift’s neurosurgeon.

As he died before the events of the film, Sebastian is oft-mentioned but never seen other than in glimpses while Taylor flashbacks to the titular last summer. This is not a bad scene, but a good scene with some bad in it; it’s not a full-on flashback with a voice-over narration as much as it is a monologue with visual aids that are unnecessary – for one thing, they are absent from Tennessee Williams’s stage play, and here they detract from the performance; the actress playing the role, whoever it may be, should be able – and Liz most certainly was – to create the imagery with her own language, both verbal and facial.

Moreover, there are a couple of background details in the flashbacks that don’t make any sense; for example, a skeleton that becomes an old woman in the next shot – something like this is meant to be a part the character’s recollection of past events, but she herself takes no notice of it, and the people listening to her have no possible way of knowing it’s there at all; the question, then, is why, indeed, is it there? Is Mankiewicz trying to tell us something about her subconscious mind? (and if so, what exactly?). Or was he the one subconsciously – and, thank God, unsuccessfully – trying to sabotage the film? I know I wouldn’t put it past a Mankiewicz.",6.0
14703,"_**Melodrama on the Mexican Coast with Burton, Gardner and Kerr**_

Released in 1964 and directed by John Huston based on Tennessee Williams' play, ""The Night of the Iguana"" stars Richard Burton as a defrocked Episcopal minister who resorts to a job leading bus tours on the Mexican west coast. As he guides a group of middle-aged Baptist women to Puerto Vallarta, he struggles with the attentions of a teen sexpot (Sue Lyon) and the antagonism of her curmudgeonly ward (Grayson Hall). The group ends up at a bed & breakfast where the effervescent proprietor (Ava Gardner) and a spiritual artist (Deborah Kerr) aid the ex-clergyman in coming to terms with the failures haunting him. Skip Ward plays the hunky bus tour assistant.

As much as I appreciate this drama, it's too bad it was shot in B&W as color would've really enhanced it, particularly considering the resort setting. (I'll never understand why filmmakers insist on shooting in B&W when color is readily available). The movie is also marred by some contrived melodrama with Burton guilty of chewing too much scenery. At the same time, it's interesting to go back in time with these old dramas and observe the artificialities of the (over)acting based on the contrivances of an inflexible script.

Despite my criticisms, there's a lot to savor here. The rich (and sometimes synthetic) dialogue is full of gems to mine. The film is an honest rumination on the human condition. The theme is to cease struggling and to ride out the hardships of life, whether they're the result of one's own folly or otherwise. The answer will come; just be on the look-out for the ""messenger"" or ""assistant"" and, of course, accept.

On other fronts, Sue Lyon is outstanding as the Lolita, probably because she literally played Lolita in her previous film, 1962's ""Lolita."" Thankfully, she's more womanly here. She was 17 during filming and thoroughly sumptuous, particularly in her short shorts. Gardner also looked great at 41, but her character is too boozy and it's a turn-off. She's well contrasted by the almost saintly Kerr.

Interestingly, there's a brief denouncement of lesbianism, which wouldn't work today. In our current upside down culture it would be hailed as the highest good, worthy of a call from the President (rolling my eyes).

The Westerner is directed by William Wyler and written by Niven Busch, Jo Swerling and Stuart N. Lake. It stars Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan, Fred Stone and Doris Davenport. Music is by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Gregg Toland. 

Story is a fictionalised account about Judge Roy Bean (Brennan), who here rules Vingaroon Town by his own law and punishment. When suspected horse thief Cole Harden (Cooper) comes under his judicial system, they become odd friends due to Harden claiming to know personally Lily Langtree - the object of Bean's worship. 

Lots of uncredited work was involved in the making of The Westerner, while Cooper famously sulked about not having the main character role, so much so his part was expanded and he performed under contract but under protest! Fact is is that it is as everyone has said before, Brennan steals the film regardless, winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in the process. Cooper needn't have worried, he's very good here, turning in a number of various strains to Harden's character, bouncing off of Brennan to the pics eternal benefit. 

At the core of the plot is a good old fashioned thread involving Homesteaders versus Cattlemen, with Bean throwing his weight around and Harden forced to reevaluate his standing in the town when he falls for Jane Ellen Mathews (Davenport). The Lily Langtree (Lilian Bond) strand gives the pic an offbeat sensibility, making this a sort of dramatic comedy oater, but it works really well. Toland's photography is superb, sharp black and white sequences are given ethereal qualities, hinting at the fact this at times fun picture might be leading to a darker path?

Some quick thinking, a few coins and a photo of actress Lily Langtree manage to save his bacon long enough for him to befriend the judge before he gets involved in a ruthless turf war between the local cattlemen against the homesteaders. Brennan is smashing. Evil, but his adoration of Langtree gives him a smidge of humanity too. Cooper is fine but very much in Brennan's Oscar winning shadow.

That brains/brawn reversal was extremely fun in the first film and unfortunately dialed back a little in the second. The dynamic worked, and it returns a bit with The Curse of the Judas Chalis.

14746,"Bombers, Blasters, Attackers and Streets of Fire.

Streets of Fire is directed by Walter Hill who also co-writes the screenplay with Larry Gross. It stars Michael Paré, Diane Lane, Rick Moranis, Amy Madigan and Willem Dafoe. Music is scored by Ry Cooder and cinematography is by Andrew Laszlo.

When the lead singer of Ellen Aim and the Attackers is kidnapped by biker gang The Bombers, her ex-soldier of fortune boyfriend is contacted and hired to go get her back...

There were a couple of movies released in 1984 by maverick directors that were frowned upon at the time, but are now significantly held in high regard and define the saying ""cult movie"". One was Alex Cox's Repo Man, the other was Walter Hill's Streets of Fire.

Streets of Fire is a bastard hybrid of ideas and influences. In part a rock opera set to the backdrop of blink blink blinkity blink neonvillle, an unnamed place that lives and breathes between 50s angst and 80s futurism, in others it's a straight forward road/mission movie headed up by an anti-hero taking notes from Snake Plissken whilst jostling for cool space with Kyle Reese. It's a film, that by Hill's own admission, is unashamedly a collage of things he finds cool in cinema. Yet this is not a detriment to the pic, the narrative is straightforward as can be and Hill throws everything he can into the mix, and it works.

In essence it's a live action comic book, it knows it's just a film and has no pretencions to seem remotely real life. The look is wonderfully flamboyant and campy, where the hero and villain wear braces and PVC overalls respectively. The girls are a mixture of a teenage diva babe and a beer swilling roughneck babe. The city itself is a vibrant mix of colours and carnage, beauty and beats, and where the streets literally are on fire. Hill weighs in with his adroit flair for action, always kinetic, while the soundtrack rocks and the dialogue bubbles with self aware glee. Cast are super, some sexy and tough, others weaselly and weak, but all pumping the pop culture blood through the veins of the movie.

With style and cool to burn, both only beaten out by the action quotient, Streets of Fire is an ode to live action fun. And watching it now you can see just how it has influenced many a film maker post its release. Streets of Fire, one bad ass bitch funky sex machine. 9/10",9.0
14746,"Streets of Fire is like a feature-length Jim Steinman music video (admittedly not that big of a stretch), which makes all the sense in the world considering the singer/songwriter's cinematic bent. Steinman penned the opening and closing songs (one of which is the anthem “Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young”), while the score is a Ry Cooder leftover from another movie (and you could certainly do a lot worse than that). To no one’s surprise, the music is by far the best thing about the film (making me wish it was a musical proper).

The film opens with Ellen Aim and the Attackers in concert performing “Nowhere Fast.” Never mind the unfortunate band name; Ellen looks and sounds great thanks to Diane Lane’s stage presence and Laurie Sargent’s and Holly Sherwood’s voices. The show comes to an untimely end when the Bombers, a motorcycle gang led by Raven Shaddock (Willem Dafoe), crash the party and kidnap Ellen.

Raven absconds with Ellen to the Battery, a part of town the police don't dare go to; thus, Billy Fish (Moranis), Ellen's boyfriend/manager, offers Tom Cody (Michael Paré) $10,000 to rescue her — Billy doesn't know it yet, but Tom is Ellen's ex. The two are joined by McCoy (Amy Madigan), a tough girl with little tolerance for assholes.

Once again, the action plays out like an MTV montage, but this is a deliberate aesthetic choice. The sets are elaborate and detailed but nonetheless clealy sets, and the actors’ look perfectly reflects the characters that have been assigned to them, which is very convenient because what we see is exactly what we get. 

Moranis, and this is also unsurprising, makes the most of his dialogue; he has to constantly look up to make eye contact with his interlocutors, but at the same time he invariably talks down to them. “I don't know what's more pathetic, the way you talk or the way you dress,” McCoy tells him — and since Billy is supposed to be pathetic, he also not only looks but also sounds exactly the way he's supposed to. As for Dafoe, with his leather fetish and Misfits hairdo, he endows Raven with a sort of teenage Count Orlok quality.

The only real disappointment is Paré, and by extension, the romance between Tom and Ellen. We don't know what they see in each other other than their both physically attractive (which means that her relationship with Billy is actually built on a potentially more lasting foundation), and we don't care whether or not they end up together.

Moreover, there linger some hard feelings between the two, but that doesn’t justify the movie’s one truly WTF moment. We’re all familiar with that cliché that sees the protagonist knock his sidekick out, ironically to prevent the latter from 'getting hurt' when all hell breaks loose; however, this is the only film I can think of wherein the supposed hero puts his fist through the face of the woman he supposedly loves. 

It’s true that Ellen behaves like a spoiled bitch when she finds out that her ex-boyfriend had the audacity to charge her current boyfriend for saving her life when even the police couldn’t be bothered to do something, but the whole thing is still uncalled for, and the fact that she, this essentially being  a live-action cartoon, looks no worse for wear once she regains consciousness, just makes it worse — as if violence against women were a victimless crime.

Joke’s on Billy, though; he’s the one left stuck with a famous girlfriend who sings longingly in public about the guy who toyed with her emotionally and assaulted her physically; on the other hand, as a manager he probably feels much less bad about collecting his 10%.",4.0

14784,"This is quite an enjoyable depiction of some multi-lingual Arabian Nights-style scenarios as we find ""Roy"" (Lee Pace) in an hospital in 1920s Los Angeles. He had previously been a movie stuntman but an accident has robbed him of the use of his legs and so with medical science being somewhat limited, he is pretty much bedridden. Also in the hospital is the young ""Alexandria"" (Catinca Untaru) who is recovering from breaking her arm and in need of some cheering up. With a vivid and varied imagination, he begins to regale his new friend with fantastic tales of bandits and slaves all trying to defeat the epitome of evil that is ""Odious"". Along the way, she becomes enthralled as the ""Black Bandit"" tries to avenge the killing of his ""Blue"" brother by working with the equally aggrieved ""Luigi"" (Robin Smith) who turns out to be quite nimble when it comes to getting things to blow up! Indeed, before too long we have quite a few folks determined to bring their nasty antagonist to book. There is method to his madness in telling these stories, though. She is charged with procuring some medicine for him that he can't get from the nurses. When we discover just what that is, then we begin to appreciate that ""Roy"" has a darker agenda of his own. The question might be, will his stories create a bond with the youngster that might divert him from that path? This is great fun, with loads of action packed into a two hours that really does fly by. The performance from Daniel Caltagirone as the baddie reminded me a little of the sergeant from the old ""Zorro"" television series - menacing but in an almost avuncular fashion, and with loads of swash and buckle, pyrotechnics and fantastic mystery it's just as easy for us to get sucked into his stories as it is for the young ""Alexandria"" - and that's a character that's played well by the young Miss Untaru - imbuing enthusiasm, a bit of awe, and latterly something altogether a little more poignant. The scoring is lively, the dialogue frequently quite funny and the portmanteau style of chaptered storytelling works well.

14794,"Released in 1968, directed by Lindsay Anderson with a screenplay by David Sherwin, <i>If....</i> is a story of three non-conformist schoolboys played by Malcolm McDowell, Richard Warwick and David Wood, who plot revenge. Organized as a series of tableaux separated by title cards, IF... spends its first half depicting the harsh rules that these boys live under at their elite public school, and the arbitrary punishments given out by senior boys, headed by the sinister Rowntree (Robert Swann) and the distant school officials. This is all in an environment of bizarre old rituals, Latin refrains, and hardly more intelligible English public school slang (and of course, it wouldn't be a classic story of British public school life without some innuendo about buggery.) In the second half of <i>If....</i>, as the storytelling takes on an increasingly surreal tone where we question what is real and what is fantasy, the boys and a girl from town get their hands on weapons and ultimately commit a massacre.

The 1960s was a time of war in Vietnam (and other violent conflicts brought to viewers globally by the media) and youth uprisings in the United States and France. Plus, these elite British school also featured compulsory military drill. In <i>If....</i>, the walls of these boys' dormitory is covered with magazine cutouts of war photographs, as if to say that in a violent world, it is no surprise if the young too made recourse to violence. In this respect it feels very much like a precursor to Aki Kaurismäki's <i>The Match Factory Girl</i>. <i>If....</i> also reflects the new sexual freedom of 1960s Britain, and the frustration kindled in these young men who see such open sexual expression in magazines and town streets but cannot have any of it. There are a number of films from this era that document the rise of a counterculture and more open attitudes, but few are as sympathetic to these young people as this film of Anderson and Sherwin.

The only serious flaw of <i>If....</i> is that the main actors are too old to convincingly play teenagers, being in their mid 20s at the time of shooting. Imagine how much more shocking the film would be if it were real sixth-formers acting, though I suppose the (few) sex scenes made this impossible. Still, <i>If....</i> is deservedly a classic.",8.0
14794,"At a posh private school there is an hierarchy that sees the housemaster exercise rather arbitrary authority through his three ""whips"". It's usually the younger pupils they like to terrorise, but at this school there are three older men who attract their attention. There's ""Mick"" (Malcolm McDowell), ""Johnny"" (David Wood) and ""Wallace"" (Richard Warwick) and led by the former, they have little interest in conforming with the expectations of the establishment. Amidst this culture of bully or be bullied, there is also some military training provided and it's this that sparks an idea of a more direct form of rebellion - and when better to implement their plan than at a high ceremonial with an HRH and an army general in attendance. McDowell is at his malevolently mischievous best here as he exudes a spirit of belligerent bloody-mindedness that shines quite a light on the toxic atmosphere at a place of learning where individuality was distinctly frowned upon. That's not just individuality of thought and mind, but there are also asides made to sexuality as ""Wallace"" has a lot less interest in their new friend from the tea bar (Christine Noonan) and she has quite a bit more enthusiasm for ""Mick"". Though the brutality of the daily behaviour isn't explicitly displayed, there's little left to our imagination and by the end it's quite clear that writer David Sherwin is taking a swipe not just at the privilege on display here, but about the broader societal attitudes to class rather than merit. There's a fairly solid array of supporting effort on display here, too, with many characterisations firmly propping up the out-dated notions of perpetuating the status quo and inherited entitlement that help this thought-provoking story stand out.",7.0

It's the early 1980s, it's Good Friday, and Harold Shand is waiting to entertain some powerful American muscle. He hopes to get them to help fund his dockside development, but someone is murdering his men, and although Harold has a good idea who is responsible, he isn't quite prepared for the events that follow.

Plot wise, The Long Good Friday is a lesson in under taxing the audience, simplicity in structure and forgoing thunder in the name of telling a solid story. The Long Good Friday is a British gangster picture that owes more to the Paul Muni and Edward G Robinson pictures from the golden age than something like ""The Godfather"". Where the characters are men of the street, working class villains who literally could be living around the corner from us, their respective antics giving them a reputation as infamous stars to be feared - and grudgingly admired.

What many modern day film lovers may not be aware of is that ""The Long Good Friday"" had its release delayed, held back a year as Margaret Thatcher and her merry men frothed at the mouth due to the film's portrayal of the Irish Rebublican Army. This was at a time when the Irish troubles were reaching new and terrifying heights, and here in this film, the government sensed a fall out that could have sent wrong message shock waves across the British Isles. This is one of the chief reasons that lifts the pic high above many of its contemporaries, it may be a simple story, but it's not merely about two gangs striving for power on one manor!.

Barrie Keeffe's script positively bristles with a hard bastard edge, some of the set pieces play out as true Brirtish greats, once viewed they are not to be forgotten. Some of the dialogue has an air of timeless bravado about it, delivered with cockney brashness from Bob Hoskins' Harold Shand. Hoskins is on fire, seemingly revelling in the role and fusing menace with a genuine sense of earthiness, one moment Harold is the bloke you want to have a pint of beer with, the next he's one step from rage induced retribution. Helen Mirren is fabulous as Harold's wife, Victoria, loyal and unerringly calm in the face of the madness unfolding, while the supporting cast are also highly effective, with a cameo from Pierce Brosnan that is icy cold in making a point.

Perhaps now it feels like it's only of its time, and it may well be that it's only British viewers of a certain age that can readily embrace the all encompassing thread of gangland London at risk from insurgents? But I will be damned should I ever choose to love this film less with each passing year, for to me it only just stops shy of being a British masterpiece, bristling with realism at a troubled time, and cheesing off Margaret Thatcher in the process, hell it works for me, always. 9/10",9.0

His best pal ""Colin"" (Paul Freeman) is killed after seeking a quickie in the local swimming baths and one of his pubs suffers from what they conveniently describe as a ""gas leak"". He knows that someone is trying to queer his pitch, and that probably points to an insider. Girlfriend ""Victoria"" (Helen Mirren)? Ambitious sidekick ""Jeff"" (Derek Thompson) or maybe enforcer ""Harris"" (Bryan Marshall)? Well ""Harold"" has to mobilise his entire organisation if he's to salvage what he's got already let alone do any kind of deal with his already sceptical potential business partners. I don't think you could ever describe Hoskins as a versatile actor, but here he carries off the role as the increasingly bewildered gangster with skill and director John Mackenzie keeps the pace moving along well as we all try to guess just who's trying to bring his empire crashing down. Mirren isn't really on screen often enough to make much difference, but eagle-eyed folks might spot Pierce Brosnan and Karl Howman making up the numbers as the Irish continent who appear to be more complicit in the shenanigans.

Set against a backdrop of religious intolerance, and ultimately a pogrom, this is a clever, engaging depiction of the harsh conditions endured by rural Russians in general and the Jewish community specifically. Norman Jewison contrives to reconcile sometimes quite brutal stories of religious prejudice with a defiantly gentle, joyful communal spirit in a thought-provoking and personable fashion.

However, lets not be swept up in it all to not notice it's a vastly inaccurate observation on US interventions.

It's all going to kick off in Arizona between the Bonnell brothers, U.S.Marshals, and Jessica Drummond - the tough no nonsense lady rancher who controls the territory.

So what do we have here then? Just another recycled Western plot that is basically the Earp's/Clanton's feud that culminated in the Gunfight At The O.K. Corral? Well no, not really, for this is Sam Fuller on devilishly twisty form.

Fuller gives this particular Western a film noir make over, both in look and dialogue innuendo. Pic is filled with outstanding sequences, be it shocking deaths, bravado pumped show downs or chiaroscuro framing of key characters, no frame is wasted in this piece - visually or aurally.

From a psychological stand point it's a right hornets nest, a meaty broth of cynical observations on love, power and that bastion of American cinema - the Western. The action construction on offer is electrifying, if Fuller isn't dallying with various camera techniques to keep the story on the hop, he's being kinetic with is action filming. All of which is in the Scope format, with the ace Biroc weaving some monochrome magic.

Probably now it has risen above being just a cult Western classic, Fuller's standing in the decades that would follow this release have ensured that to be the case. Yet it is noted that this holds no surprises in how story eventually pans out, which is disappointing given the noir pulse beats driving it forward.

The Hot Spot is directed by Dennis Hopper and adapted to screenplay from the Charles Williams novel, ""Hell Hath No Fury"", by Nona Tyson and Charles Williams. It stars Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen, Jennifer Connelly, Charles Martin Smith and William Sadler. Music is by Jack Nitzsche and cinematography by Ueli Steiger.

Dennis Hopper loves film noir, he has been in some bona fide classic neo-noirs, whilst also turning his hand to directing that style of film making. The Hot Spot may not be a total success as such, but it is a superb effort that lovers of all things noir can feast upon. Story pitches Johnson as drifter Harry Madox, who lands in a Southern state town, bluffs his way into a car salesman job, plots a robbery, and then finds that two local ladies - of very different qualities - are about to change his life forever...

I found my level and I'm living it.

Hopper turns in a honest and faithful tribute to the first wave of film noir, but armed with the fact this was his era of film making relaxations, he gets to sex things up. Blending noir with erotic thriller conventions allows Hopper to pile on plenty of sizzle, which comes in the form of Madsen, who as Dolly Harshaw gives neo-noir one of its finest femme fatales. Overtly sexual and on the surface a ditz, an easy lay, it's only when this part of noirville shows its hand - in true old school fashion - does the character become memorable still further.

On the flip side is Connelly's more straight laced Gloria Harper, who Madox coverts, yet there's baggage there as well (is she virginal?), baggage which adds more potency and trickery to this smouldering hot spot hot-pot. The girls are great, but so is Johnson, he broods and has a raw masculinity most fitting for this type of role. It's a shame he didn't do more neo-noir because he has the tools for the trade. Hopper brings sweat, sweaty close ups and noirville fans, while the photography and musical accompaniments are superbly compliant to the required atmosphere.

The editing is a let down, so many scenes needed to have the linger factor, but it's not enough to kill this fine slice of noir pie. A sexy guy in over his head, devious machinations from both sexes, robbery, arson, deaths, ignorance and stupidity, The Hot Spot is far from being boring!

14864,"**_An amoral drifter stuck between a naïve teen and an adulteress in Texas_** 

An unprincipled man in his mid-30s (Don Johnson) rolls into a small town in the greater Austin area wherein he uses his mojo to land a job as a used car salesman. The sultry wife of the owner (Virginia Madsen) shows interest while he has his eyes on a winsome lass at the dealership (Jennifer Connelly), not to mention a nearby bank. 

Directed by Dennis Hopper, ""The Hot Spot"" (1990) is Southern Gothic neo-noir based on Charles Williams’ 1953 book “Hell Hath No Fury” (aka “The Hot Spot”).  The original script handed out to the cast was by Mike Figgis, but Hopper changed it to Williams & Nona Tyson’s screenplay from 1962 three days before shooting started. I point this out because the entire first half of the flick lazily meanders.

Take the steamy Southern Gothic of Tennessee Williams, like “The Fugitive Kind” (1960), and mix it with the more modern approach of “Two Moon Junction” (1988) and that’s this movie. It has its points of interest, like the three stars, the sweltering heat of the Deep South, the Hamilton (natural) Pool and the defunct sawmill.

It’s like a Tarantino flick in the Deep South, just without the great dialogues. Meanwhile the blackmail subplot involving William Sadler is contrived and eye-rolling. Hopper originally wanted Mickey Rourke for the lead role and maybe that’s what got things off to a bad start. I should add that Johnson is certainly the king of cool here and I had zero problem with him in the role; Harry is just ignoble and therefore contemptible, although he has an impressive kick-axx side to him.

For something similar but superior, check out Michael Cimino’s underrated “Desperate Hours” (1990), which was released one week earlier.

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in the heart of Texas as follows: Taylor (bank robbery), which is northeast of Austin; Luling (old sawmill), which is south of Austin; and Dripping Springs (swimming scenes), which is west of Austin. The sand dune sequence in the opening was shot at Monahans Sandhills State Park, which is along I-20 midway between Pecos and Midway, about 25 miles from the border of New Mexico.

Immediately, you can tell there is a dip in the quality of animation.  To be fair, no only is this in that string of unnecessary sequels that Disney did, it is right after they switched from classic cell animation to digital cell animation, but it was 2 years after ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" and that looks amazing.

The other immediate problem (even on the cover) is that Mowgli is still wearing his mystery diaper (never established where it came from) instead of actual clothes.

As Mowgli struggles with being of two worlds (an arguably great point from the original movie), he extends his entitled behavior to returning to the Jungle, aggravating the village, as Sher Khan returns to hunting Mowgli, extending his obsession / pride (sort of a Moby Dick thing).

Lacking some creativity, they return to some of the old songs (3 that I can think of, ""Bear Necessities"" and ""Jungle Rhythm"" being over used, and ""I Wanna Be Like You"" at the credits of all places) instead of using original material.

As the adventures continue it's reveal that Mowgli had no natural connection to the animals, it's just that EVERYTHING speaks English, the other human characters don't bat an eye or lose a beat.  It completely ruins the movie.  At least in Tarzan it was clear he would ""ooh ooh"" to the Guerillas.  What little charm they were able to drag from the previous movie to this one is just destroyed by that.

The dramatization of Mowgli's endangerment also has a lesser impact this time, as he's survived before, and this time around we also have 2 other hapless children running about the Jungle who must have been blessed with invincibility to survive all that they do.

14877,"_**A story that had to be told and needs to be known**_

""September Dawn"" (2007) is a powerful and unforgettable film. It details the long covered-up massacre at Mountain Meadows, Utah, on September 7-11, 1857, where a group of Mormons murdered well over a hundred settlers traveling from Arkansas to California. The settlers stopped in southwest Utah to rest and resupply and the Mormons who lived there graciously allowed it. Unfortunately, in the ensuing days the decision was made to slaughter the settlers, likely due to paranoia over the brief ""Utah War"" that was going on at the time (between the Feds and the Mormon settlers in Utah) and also because of the Mormons' severe persecutions back East in the 1830s-40s, which provoked them to seek sanctuary in Utah in 1847.

Brigham Young was the president of the LDS denomination at the time and the governor of Utah. Was he involved in the decision to slaughter the innocent settlers? Although Mormon leaders deny this to this day it's possible for two reasons: (1.) As the LDS president and Utah governor it's unlikely that something of this magnitude would have been carried out without Young's authorization; and (2.) the leader of the slaughter, John D. Lee – the only man convicted and shot for the massacre – was the adopted son of Brigham Young. The film theorizes that the murderers took an oath of silence and that's why the massacre has been covered-up by LDS officials to this day, although Lee admitted to being the scapegoat before his execution. Chew on that.

The vibe of the film is very realistic, sort of like ""Dances With Wolves,"" although not as compelling. For instance, the Paiute natives -- whom the Mormons hoodwinked into participating in the initial assault -- are very well done. The acting is convincing across the board with only one dubious part. In this regard ""September Dawn"" stands head & shoulders above roll-your-eyes Westerns of yesteryear.

Perhaps the film has such an authentic vibe because it's based on the historical facts and is fair with them. For one, the film utilizes Juanita Brooks' book and others as sources, and they happen to be devout Mormons. Secondly, the film reveals the valid reasons for the Mormon's paranoia – due to the Feds' harassment presently and also previous persecutions back East, _severe_ persecutions. Thirdly, the film details a peculiar doctrine the Mormons adhered to – ""blood atonement"" – that gave them the mentality that they were doing the settlers a favor by killing them (that is, the settlers would die to this temporal world but they'd be eternally blessed, or something to this effect).

Some have criticized the film for adding a romantic subplot concerning a Mormon youth and a settler girl, but this is a typical Hollywood technique, e.g. ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Red Baron"" and ""Titanic."" Others object to a Mormon youth cracking up after the massacre – another fictional addition – but it makes sense that an unhardened youth would lose his marbles, so to speak, after such a horrific undertaking and, again, it's portrayed in a convincing manner. Besides, who's to say something like these two subplots didn't happen? It's very possible something similar to them did.

Although the story takes place in Southwest Utah they couldn't shoot there for obvious reasons. So they shot it in central Alberta, near Calgary. Although these locations are an acceptable substitute they lack the more arid look of SW Utah.

Bottom Line: The harsh criticism that has been dished out on this film is ridiculous and not even remotely accurate. Although it's sometimes a hard film to watch for obvious reasons, ""September Dawn"" is a worthy modern Western that dares to sneer at political correctness and tell the truth, at least as far as can be done by the documented facts. Sure there's some speculation and fictionalization, but all movies based on historical events do this to some extent and, like I said above, these fictionalizations are based on likely possibilities. I guarantee you that ""September Dawn"" is far more historically accurate than heralded films like ""Braveheart."" 

Since the film is so well done I can only chalk up the ridiculous criticism to intolerant liberal ideology. After all, the film dares to show Christians in a positive light being led to the slaughter literally by wacko religious fanatics. Not that all Mormons back then or today are wacko religious fanatics, not at all, but that group that murdered the innocent settlers definitely were and, more specifically, those who authorized it and led the (otherwise good) men involved to carry it out.

14881,"Well the deer didn't know where he was, and I wasn't sure either.

There's a certain school of thought with Eastwood purists that Joe Kidd is far more meaningful than its reputation would suggest. In fact, that it most certainly is not in the lower tier of Eastwood Westerns that ratings across internet forums say otherwise. Truth is, is that with Eastwood starring, Robert Duval and John Saxon supporting, John Sturges directing and Elmore Leonard writing, well this really should have turned out far better than it did.

In short order it has Eastwood as gunslinger/bounty hunter Joe Kidd who somehow finds himself helping a wealthy landowner and his henchmen to track down a Mexican revolutionary leader - it's a land issue we think.... But once on the trail as part of the posse, Kidd comes to find a conflict of interest and soon enough taking sides is just one of the issues to hand.

Sadly I myself can't join with the band of loyal fans who put forward this as a misunderstood piece of work. It plods along as it works its way through a muddled screenplay, which really is very thin from a narrative standpoint, and ultimately it doesn't pay off for character crescendo value come the finale. Add in that Duval's character is poorly under written and Saxon is miscast and you got a few problems to be annoyed about.

However, the script does have some nifty dialogue, Bruce Surtees' location photography is outstanding, while Eastwood is yet again a magnetic presence that draws you in to stay the course. Action is well enough handled, including a brilliant finale involving a train as a weapon of mass destruction, and there's some weapons of interest to be interested in!. But you feel that there should have been a bit more complexity on show here, and that the running time of just an hour and twenty minutes does suggest, there's half an hour of film that really should have been added here. 6/10",6.0

14881,"**_Eastwood’s “lost” Western with Duvall and Saxon_**

In the Southwest in 1902 a land-grabbing tycoon (Robert Duvall) hires an ex-bounty hunter (Clint Eastwood) in order to track down a Mexican leader who objects to injustice (John Saxon) and is hiding out in the high country with his people. Don Stroud is on hand as one of the pompous gringo’s heavies.

""Joe Kidd"" (1972) is generally viewed as one of Eastwood’s lesser Westerns when it’s more entertaining than Sergio Leone’s overrated trilogy from 1964-1966, at least in my opinion. It has a notable cast, a superb score and great locations, not to mention being directed by John Sturges, known for great (or near-great) films like “The Law and Jake Wade” (1958), “Chino” (1973) and “The Eagle Has Landed” (1977).

True, Sturges was reportedly struggling with alcoholism during shooting and the story starts to meander in the high country during the second act, but the flick works as a whole and everything ties-together for the climax. Originally, Saxon’s ‘bandit,’ Chama, was supposed to be more heroic, but this was changed when Clint was hired on and Joe Kidd became the amusingly fearless hero, the intermediary between two opposing forces.

Very little is predictable, from the interesting costumes & weaponry to the bizarre plot twists to the amusing ways the protagonist gets himself into and out of trouble, like the ladder/trapdoor sequence, the swinging water jug scene, the sniper vs. sniper sequence and the whacky train ride.

Stella Garcia (Helen) and Lynne Marta (Elma) are featured in the feminine department.

Anyone who favors Eastwood’s other Westerns will find a lot to like here.

Two Petty Officers in Norfolk, Virginia (Jack Nicholson and Otis Young), are assigned a shore patrol detail to escort a naïve 18-year-old Seaman (Randy Quaid) to Portsmouth Naval Prison just across the coastal border of Maine. They decide to give the ‘kid’ a good time in several misadventures along the way. 

“The Last Detail” (1973) is a road movie in the Northeast during the transition from late Fall to early Winter (shot in November-January). While a realistic drama, it’s also a dark comedy with interesting and amusing commentaries on life, the American military, corruption, injustice, friendship, recreation, folly, sexual relations and so on. To be expected with young characters in the military, the talk and shenanigans are often R-rated.

Nicholson’s friend, Dennis Hopper, took the template of this film to make the similar ""Chasers"" two decades later (1994). While it’s way more obscure, “Chasers” is the more entertaining film. This one is too mundane on occasion, like when the guys drink & blather in their underwear in the hotel room. Another similar flick is ""The Lucky Ones"" (2007). While I feel “The Last Detail” is the least of the three, it’s definitely worth checking out.

The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot on location, taking the same journey as the trio, except for Toronto doubling as Norfolk in the first act, as well as a later scene involving the fictitious Calvin Coolidge Junior High. The rest of the film was shot in coastal Virginia, DC, New York City, Massachusetts and New Hampshire/Maine.

Charged with getting him to the jail are two veteran chancers ""Buddusky"" (Jack Nicholson) and ""Mule"" (Otis Young). These two think this is all just a bit of a lark that will get them away from the grind, but they haven't bargained on their prisoner. He comes across as little more than a timid child. Nervous and vulnerable. Why not make sure his last day of freedom is a bit more enjoyable? A few drinks won't hurt. Then, maybe, an hooker to pop his cherry (and make him even more aware of what he's going miss for the next eight years!). As you'd expect, as the young man starts to come out of his shell a little, this trio start to bond and they also begin to question their own attitudes and priorities as they get ever closer to the end of their task. Nicholson is in his element here: slightly loud, completely flaky and over the top. His characterisation of the decent but flawed ""Buddusky"" is powerfully presented here and is foiled equally well by the more understated Young who has a slightly more stoic, reserved, reaction to a life that perhaps his colour has drummed into him over the years. It's Quaid, though, that stole this for me. He plays the part like he's a flower waiting to blossom - and a prickly and thorny one, at that. It's all about masculinity but it's also about picking holes in that façade as these men deal with their own humanity all whilst they all make sure there are some darkly comedic enterprises along the way, too - just ask Carol Kane. Perhaps the USN won't have liked the portrayal of it's elite, here?

RELEASED IN 2003 and directed by Boaz Yakin, ""Uptown Girls"" is a dramedy with a little romance about Molly (Brittany Murphy), a fun-loving 22 year-old who suddenly loses her inherited riches and is forced to become a nanny to a stoical neat-freak girl, Ray (Dakota Fanning). Heather Locklear plays Ray’s distant mother who’s an exec in the music biz while Jesse Spencer plays a hunky musician who gets signed. Marley Shelton and Donald Faison are on hand as friends of Molly. 

The first act didn’t do much for me, but at the halfway point something made me bust out laughing and I busted out four more times before it was over. More importantly, the movie is rich with quality mind/spirit food. Both Molly and Ray are broken people who handle their grief in opposite ways. And each has what the other needs to heal and escape their disorder.

“Uptown Girls” boldly reveals that “meds” (drugs) cannot heal or deliver a person; the best they can do is help a person cope.

Sadly, six years after the release of the film Murphy ironically died of cardiac arrest due to inadvertent overdoses of a mixture of over-the-counter & prescription drugs taken (they presume) for a respiratory infection. She was only 32.

Ex-con Frederick Frenger Jr. (Baldwin) lands in Miami and quickly continues his criminal ways. Hooking up with gullible prostitute Susie Waggoner (Leigh), Frenger, by now under suspicion for the killing of a Hare Krishna man at Miami airport, steals the identity of the policeman investigating him and ups his crime spree...

This is all about the characterisations, for the story is simple and played as a darkly comic hard boiled cop picture. We are in a stripped back Miami, no gloss here, wherever the psychotic Frenger goes, there is crime that he is only too willing to enhance. Quite often with violent but humorous results. His union with Susie is a matter of convenience, as she, the gullible tart with the heart, dreams of a white picket fence house - marriage - babies, he dreams only of her cash and the comfort of cover she affords his criminal doings. Then there is Sgt. Hoke Moseley (Ward), straight out of noirville, world weary, grizzled, incapable of genuine affection, tatty and someone who soaks his false teeth in a glass of brandy! It's a wonderful character brought vividly to life by Ward, especially when Frenger steals said set of teeth! And with Leigh and Baldwin also making good on the characters as written, this is very much worth a look for the acting performances.

It's not under seen or under valued, the respective ratings on internet sites and critical appraisals are about right. There's some value in the dark comedy born out of the crime sequences, where we are dared not to smile, and the violence is impacting without hitting us over the head for the sake of it.

14976,"Rachel Getting Married left me feeling quite ambivalent. On the one hand I was really impressed with the acting (most notably from Anne Hathaway), on the other I just couldn't get myself to care. But that's really the director's doing; after all, it's his job to get me involved and to make me care about the story he's telling, and unfortunately, Jonathan Demme failed to do so with this film.

Something that throws you off right from the start is the incredibly shaky hand-held camera. There isn't a steady shot throughout the entire film. It actually gave me a headache during the first five minutes. This, in combination with the lack of proper story- and character build-up makes you feel like you're watching a home video of some stranger's wedding. And it's not particularly interesting… Strangely enough, during some parts of the film I felt like I was watching a Louis Theroux documentary, because that's exactly the way it was filmed. I expected a gangly Englishman with dark glasses to walk in at any moment and start asking questions. Actually, that might have done this film a world of good… Scenes go on way too long without there being a clear point to it, and I just have to wonder why Demme decided to go this way. I mean, he has made some really good films in the past, and I was strangely surprised to see he directed this. It looks and feels more a graduation project from some film student, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is when your name is Jonathan Demme. I even fast-forwarded some parts because the scenes were really dragging and I got bored. I actually felt like turning it off a few times, and that doesn't happen to me lot.

In the end though, I'm glad I stuck with it, because the second half of the film picks up the pace and finally introduces some real character drama.

Simply put, this film is about a drug addict who gets leave from rehab for a few days to attend her sister's wedding and pretty much ruins the whole thing. Anne Hathaway is very impressive as Kym, a self-centred, reckless addict, and she plays her role convincingly. So much so even, that she manages to make you feel NOT sympathetic towards her character at all. She is completely self-absorbed and unlikable, and even steals her sister Rachel's thunder when she (Rachel) announces to her family that she is pregnant, and Kym immediately turns the conversation around and makes it all about her again, and does so on many more occasions. I know that many people who are related to drug addicts will be able to relate to these typical symptoms, so in that sense, it was all very real. On her part, Rosemarie DeWitt, who plays Rachel, was equally impressive as she firmly stood her ground as the loyalty-torn older sister who only asks to be in the spotlight for one day of her life, without her troubled sister claiming all the attention. However, the part that mostly struck a nerve with me was that of their dad, played by Bill Irwin, who is, more than anyone, caught in loyalty limbo, not wanting to have to choose sides between his two daughters. He doesn't overact his inner conflict in any way, yet he garners more sympathy than anyone, because he makes his pain so understandable.

In fact, everything about Rachel getting married is all very human and relatable. The story (written by Jenny Lumet, daughter of Sidney!) is not one any of us have never heard before, but that's alright. We don't always need super complicated psycho-analysis with characters talking like they all studied Freud for the past twenty years. Sometimes, simple stories about human troubles are enough to carry a film. It may be somewhat predictable, with a quasi-happy ending, but it's still credible enough to leave you satisfied.

And yet, I don't feel this film deserves much more than a 6, maybe a 7. And the fault of this lies entirely with the direction. The shaky home video style I mentioned earlier might work for The Blair Witch project, but not for a slow-paced character drama. And the pacing was just horrible. Some scenes were completely unnecessary and could have easily been cut down or even left out completely and nobody would have noticed. In fact, that would have helped a lot. It's really a shame, because the story is decent and the acting is great, but this is not a great film and it never will be. I do think it's worth the watch, especially if you want to see Anne Hathaway in what is probably a career-defining role. But from the man who made Philadelphia, this is a bitter disappointment.

It's a strong biblical story this - you might recall Joan Collins did a version in 1960 with Richard Egan - but this is all style over substance with way too much emphasis on the grand look of the film and nowhere near enough effort on the shocking casting of Luke Goss (Xerxes) and the underwhelming Tiffany Dupont as the girl destined to secure the future of her people. Perhaps Omar Sharif was taking a break from the poker table, but there can be little excuse for the hammy effort of an over-the-top John Rhys-Davies nor the one-gear only John Noble as this story develops, completely devoid of passion or pace. The screenplay seems determined to use an adaptation from a children's book of (verbose) bible stories and in the end it all just fails to deliver. It ends with a power balled ""...One night with a king... changes everything..."" Even Bros didn't stoop to rhymes quite that complicated. Enough said!",5.0

Exploitation cinema in all its glory, or not, depending on your own personal peccadilloes! Directed, written and produced by Bo Arne Vibenius, Thriller - en grym film (AKA: They Call Her One Eye) is an infamous picture for a number of reasons, reasons that would take a whole page to write about. So use your mouse and google it because this review isn't interested in dabbling in such fare.

Plot sees a young Madeline raped by a paedophile and rendered mute by the experience. Into early adulthood and Madeline (played superbly by soft core porn starlet Christinia Lindberg) unwisely takes up the offer of a lift from the odious Tony (Heinz Hopf). Pretty soon she's addicted to heroin and working as a prostitute. However, Madeline is biding her time, for she has plans, plans that spell doom for all her abusers.

Does this film have artistic merit? Absolutely! In fact if you take out the inserted pornographic close-ups, which are pointless since we already know what Madeline is going through (a supposed marketing tool of the era apparently...) then this is a kick-ass film. It's a two parter, where the first half shows all of Madeline's misery, with sexual disturbance and body horror, then we switch to Madeline's fight back, where we get one of the coolest anti-heroines of 70s exploitation. She's sporting an eye patch, a glorious black trench coat, and weapons, oh yes! There are weapons, hands, guns and cars, oh my! It's here where Vibenius asks the question about justifiable revenge, whilst the super slow-mo approach to the violence will either be viewed as indulgent or classy (I'm with the latter camp).

It is what it is, grungy and grimy, operating in a specialist niche of cinema, but worthy in that it didn't conform, and it has proved influential. It's just not a date movie or something to watch with you mom! Right, I'm off for a bath. 7/10",7.0
15018,Okay rape-revenge thriller has a fine performance from Christina Lindberg even though she has zero lines and there are scenes tough to watch.

The cast isn't bad by far, but, for this, they could have been quite better to really sell the effects and create a better atmosphere for the story.

The story itself is good, it makes a lot of sense, the character interaction is pretty good, and it actually structures a compelling narrative.

Bodies have started turning up with W∆Z carved into their skin, cops Eddie Argo (Stellan Skarsgård) and Helen Westcott (Melissa George) investigate and find something truly disturbing is afoot.

It's cut from the same cloth as Saw, Seven and to a degree Hostel, in that it's torture pornish in narrative essence, and aesthetically grim with its neo-noir greens and browns.

15070,"A very good movie could be made with Wesley Snipes, Ving Rhames, Michael Rooker, Wes Studi and Peter Falk; Undisputed is not that movie, and the fault lies not in its stars, but in writer/producer/director Walter Hill. 

This is unfortunate because the film initially appears to be smarter than the average prison movie. Instead of the usual Force Prized Fights/Involuntary Battles to the Death wherein a Condemned Contestant goes through a Tournament Arc in order to Win His Freedom, we get a state-sanctioned, inter-prison boxing program.

Sadly, Undisputed manages to avoid all the above-mentioned clichés only to succumb to the The Thunderdome. In lieu of a ring with ropes, the bouts take place in a big-ass, roofless cage with barbed wire atop its walls — but why? Why go to the trouble of establishing the lawfulness of the premise only to make the actual thing look like a Texas Death Match?

Anyway, disgraced heavyweight champion George 'The Iceman' Chambers (Rhames) is convicted of rape, sentenced to 6-8 years, and sent to Sweetwater maximum security prison in California. Chambers asks his cellmate Mingo (Studi) why he’s there. Mingo replies that «it's not considered polite to ask why we're here. Kinda violation of the ethics. You know, the code?»

No, I don’t know. What code? I’d seriously like to know, because it would mean that every prison movie where a character asks another character what he’s in there for (i.e., all of them) is in breach of some sort of tacit etiquette system.

Mingo’s right, though; no need to ask when Hill helpfully includes captions detailing the lives and crimes of every single characters — even those who only appear in a couple of scenes. Why exactly do we need to know that the announcer/commentator is a con artist convicted of larceny in 1995 named Marvin?

Mendy Ripstein (Falk), an elderly mobster/boxing fan, becomes dead set on booking a fight between Chambers and Sweetwater’s own state champion Monroe Hutchens (Snipes), so that he can (according to All Movie) ""pull in a million dollars in bets from guards and inmates"" (the movie actually speaks of multiple millions of dollars; either way, that’s a lot of cigarettes). 

Chuy (Jon Seda), Ripstein's caretaker or something, says “I talked to the head guard [Rooker]. He’s OK agrees. But the warden [Dennis Arndt] is a problem.” The nature of this problem seems to be that the warden can’t make up his goddamn mind; first he allows the fight, as long as it happens while he’s on vacation. 

He then backtracks and cancels it. Finally, he backpedals yet again and agrees to it. He’s not the only indecisive one, however; at first Ripstein wants a bare knuckle fight, but then someone complains, Ripstein thinks it over for about five seconds, and decides that it’s better with gloves — so why bring it up at all. 

I understand why they cast Falk in this role, but they needn’t have bothered him for something that Burt Young could have easily handled. As for Rooker and Studi, Hill forgot to write parts for them to play — which is odd considering that Rooker as a sadistic, racist guard C.O and Studi a mystical mentor are parts that pretty much write themselves (and even such clichés, that both actors are more than able to elevate beyond the commonplace, would be better than nothing).

That leaves Snipes, who does with his Zen Warrior what he can (not much, since he spends a good chunk of the movie in solitary confinement), and Rhames, who has the juiciest character and makes the most of it, as a man torn between the need to be a ""model prisoner"" if he wants to regain his freedom and resume his career before it’s too late, and his pathological desire to be respected and feared at all costs, something he only knows to achieve through physical violence. 

Unfortunately, the ugly business of rape remains unaccountably ambiguous. Chambers is unequivocally the antagonist, and Rhames is so good at being bad that it's hard to believe his claims of innocence. 

Therefore, either Chambers is innocent in that particular respect but a horrible human being in general, or he's guilty and ultimately gets away with it, since in exchange for fighting Monroe, Ripstein uses his clout to get Chambers out ""in special parole” (one has to wonder why Ripstein, who can get someone paroled without having served the minimum time required, doesn't use his obviously vast influence to his own advantage). 

We are supposed to believe that the humiliation of being beaten by Monroe is punishment enough; Chuy narrates at the end that “The Iceman and his manager denied that the fight with Monroe ever happened and the story that he lost was just a big rumour” — and why wouldn’t they? It is, after all,  their word against that of 700 witnesses between inmates and prison staff, not to mention, as Marvin points out, “our friends from Las Vegas, here to witness this competition and report to various cities across our great country. A lot of bookmakers want to know what's coming."" D'oh!",2.0

15081,"Cracking little film.

<em>'The Three Lives of Thomasina'</em> is very cute and surprisingly existential. It's well shot and paced, with a terrific adult cast - the child members do cheapen things a little, but not to point where it affects enjoyment.

Patrick McGoohan (Dr. MacDhui) and Susan Hampshire (Lori) are both excellent, they suit their respective roles perfectly. Laurence Naismith, who I enjoyed in 1961's <em>'Greyfriars Bobby: The True Story of a Dog'</em>, appears in a somewhat minor role but still makes it memorable. Elspeth March does a fine job voicing Thomasina, too.

It sends a positive message and actually delves relatively deep into the human/animal side. Not saying it's a masterpiece in that regard or anything, I just didn't expect it would have that sorta spirit.

This was technically released in 1963 ('properly' in 1964), a year that I didn't enjoy in terms of Disney live-action films so this is easily the best in relative to that. If you love cats you'll enjoy this, you should give it a watch regardless.",8.0

20 Million Miles to Earth is written by Bob Williams and Christopher Knopf from an original treatment by Charlott Knight. The film was produced by Charles H. Schneer's Morningside Productions for Columbia Pictures and directed by Nathan H. Juran. It stars William Hopper, Joan Taylor, Frank Puglia and a Ymir, a creation by stop-motion maestro Ray Harryhausen.

The plot sees an American rocket ship on its return from a mission to Venus, crash land in the Mediterranean Sea near the Sicilian village of Gerra. Some fishermen aid the stricken ship and manage to pull free two survivors, Colonel Bob Calder and Dr. Sharman. Once Calder recovers it becomes known that an important canister brought from Venus has not been found after the crash. However, Pepe, a young fisher-boy who was present at the rescue, found the container and sold its rubbery contents to his Zoologist friend Dr. Leonardo. Whilst in the hands of Dr. Leonardo the gelatin like substance gives birth to a tiny Venusian bipedal creature called a Ymir, but it doesn't stay tiny for very long...

As the work of Dynamation legend Harryhausen got more accomplished and praised, it became a standing joke that his creatures were better actors than most of their adult co-stars. That's never more truer than with 20 Million Miles to Earth, where one of his best creations takes centre stage and acts the actors off the screen. It's also true that some, not all, of Harryhausen influenced movies are just thin clothes lines to hang his work upon. Thankfully that isn't the case here, for although it's homage a go go to King Kong, where Harryhausen hero Willis O'Brien pioneered the stop-motion process, Juran's movie has intelligence within its on the surface monster on the rampage plot.

There's nothing totally new in this genre piece about mans pursuit of more via technological advancement, the unremitting pursuit of science as a tool or plaything. So where Jeff Goldblum mused in Jurassic Park many years later, about that nobody stopped to ask if they should be tampering with science and nature, so it be here. Where the Ymir creature is whipped from its home planet, starts off harmless, afraid, puzzled and very much a stranger in a strange land, yet is provoked into an aggressive state. This even after we are told that the Ymir only attacks if being attacked first, cue next scene as man who said it starts poking confused creature with a big pole! You would laugh if it were it not so adroitly cunning.

Not only does the big question of ""why?"" loom large as things spiral out of control here in Italy, but animal rights are also given a poke, as is a nice thread as regards guns. It's just too cute not to mean something as Pepe, quite the capitalist indeed, wants to be an American cowboy. Buying himself a Texas hat he happily starts clicking away with his toy guns like some Western cowboy of the silver screen. You just know what is around the corner, soon enough the mighty army are throwing everything at poor Ymir, guns, tanks, bazookas, flame throwers, you name it and the mighty military are using it. America flexes its weaponry muscles on foreign soil, indeed. Against something that they are responsible for being here in the first place! You would laugh if it wee not so cunning...

Of course the trump card here is the creature itself because it shows a number of basic emotions. Harryhausen works his magic as Ymir goes through the various stages of its sad stay on Earth. From its brilliant birthing sequence where it rubs its eyes and shies away from the light, to the rousing finale at the Colosseum where rage and anger has fully taken over as the creature fights for its life; on a planet it doesn't know or wanted to be on anyway. This ""thing"" may eat Sulphur, but it has one hell of a personality thanks to Ray, who sat at his table for days on end creating these wonderful sequences for us to enjoy. Letting the creature breath, flick its tale and wrestle other animals. Quite a character indeed.

No personalities with the human cast though, Hopper (son of actress and gossip columnist, Hedda) is lantern jawed adequate enough for the role, and Taylor is pretty but playing a totally perfunctory character. While the Italian characters are as stereotypical as they come. But just like King Kong, 20 Million Miles to Earth has many fans who just adore it. More so now as advancements in DVD technology have seen remastered releases (even with a colour choice that's not bad at all) reach a new and interested audience.

15120,"RELEASED IN 1983 and directed by Dick Lowry, ""Smokey and the Bandit Part 3” is a car chase comedy about Big Enos and Little Enos (Pat McCormick & Paul Williams) betting Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) that he can’t drive from Miami to the Enos ranch in Texas in a short period of time. The Sheriff is joined by his dimwitted hunk of a son (Mike Henry). Meanwhile Cledus ""Snowman"" Snow (Jerry Reed) takes the place of The Bandit, teaming up with a woman who just quit her job at a used car lot (Colleen Camp).

Burt Reynolds and Sally Field are absent in this third entry of the Good Ol’ Boy series, except for Burt having a glorified cameo at the end. Gleason takes the lead with Mike Henry’s support. The latter is so effective in his inane role that you completely forget that he played a serious Tarzan in three movies from 1966-1968, not to mention the formidable corrupt Sheriff in “Rio Lobo” (1970). At 46 during shooting, you’ll observe that he certainly kept in shape.

Car chase comedies like this are meant for leaving your brain at the door and having fun, but this inferior sequel makes me want to up my rating for the original “Smokey and the Bandit” (1977). There’s an amateurish vibe, particularly with the writing and editing, which prevents it from attaining even the low level of ""Cannonball Run 2"" (1984). Still, it’s the most action-packed (and goofy) entry in the series and it has its points of silly amusement.

Colleen Camp is serviceable essentially replacing Field on the female front, although not enough is done with her. If you’re not familiar with Colleen, she played the Indian playmate in “Apocalypse Now” (1979) and the hot French maid in “Clue” (1985). Anyway, this segment arguably features the best women in the periphery. Faith Minton is on hand as a 6’1” Amazonian who takes a liking to the Sheriff.

What can one say about a film that now, as it gears towards its next anniversary of a 50th birthday, is loved and adored by so many? It feels, to me at least, kind of redundant trying to even write a review of it now. So really I just want to say that as a mid-forties cinema loving man I revisited the film recently for the first time in about 15 years and found it still had a magical kind of hold over me. Yes I still think it's too long, but ask me what I would cut out of the film and I'm at a bit of a loss to answer.

Over the last thirty years or so it has become something of a focal point for parody, somewhat diminishing the actual film's first time appeal. Then there are the charges of it being hackneyed, but they are misplaced and very unfair for The Sound Of Music is an ode to life and music, nothing remotely hackneyed there me thinks. Bookended by stunning Salzburg scenery {seriously the opening helicopter sequence is breath taking}, the rest in between is a series of brilliant set pieces and some unforgettable Rodgers & Hammerstein tunes. Led by Julie Andrews & Christoher Plummer, the cast delight throughout. Yes, not everyone is note perfect, but it's a moot point really.

I've said it before, but musicals aren't my favourite genre - I don't dislike them at all, but if I were to rank my favourite genres they would probably be down low. Therefore, I always feel uncertain before watching them, knowing they could go either way.

<em>'The Sound of Music'</em>, though, is a delight. As alluded to, I have obviously heard countless positive things about this film down the years so I'm glad it didn't disappoint. Despite a potentially damaging 175 minute run time, it absolutely flew by - superb pacing. I will say the last 30-40 minutes do feel like a possibly unnecessary add-on, but it all still makes for entertaining viewing.

How about that soundtrack? So many songs that have seriously passed the test of time in terms of relevance, I had practically heard of them all before despite never setting eyes of the film until now. ""My Favorite Things"" is the standout in my opinion, but all the music is excellent.

Julie Andrews is terrific in the role of Maria, I will say early on I thought she might've been annoying given how excitable she is, but she quickly becomes great to watch throughout. Christopher Plummer is impressive, also. Those two are the clear stars of this, but all the other cast members do worthy jobs too.

15121,"The opening scene from this film has been parodied umpteen times, and I think that just goes to show just how impactful Robert Wise's adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein story has been on cinema. The idea that one could have seven children is, frankly, quite terrifying (I have none) so I can readily empathise with poor old Julie Andrews ""Maria"" as she is despatched from the safety of her nunnery to be the governess to this extended brood in the home of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). After an initially hostile reception from both father and youngsters alike, ""Maria"" soon ingratiates herself with all concerned - except, perhaps, for the Captain's beau Eleanor Parker who is wonderfully elegant and aloof as the ""Baroness"" - and romance gradually takes firm hold. The anschluss injects some seriousness into the fluffiness of the plot - the family must adjust to their new Nazi ""protectors"", but when the Captain is invited to take up a commission in the Navy they realise that they must act. Though a little cheesy at times, Andrews and Plummer are terrific, the songs are the stuff of musical legend, and I suspect one of the things that makes this more enduring is the fact that it is based on truth. The happiness tinged with the peril of the enveloping ruthlessness of the Nazis gives this an authenticity that would have been felt by many in Europe as Hitler was in the ascendancy and Wise manages to capture a little of that feeling. It's got some classy supporting performances from Peggy Wood (the Mother Abbess), a super Richard Haydn as the charming, if slightly opportunistic ""Uncle Max"" and even the ordinarily upstanding nuns get in on the act. There is definitely a chemistry between the two stars as their love story enfolds with the help of the children, a rather lavish puppet show - and a bit of Strauss!

Released a year after Pretty In Pink, writer John Hughes further cemented his status as the king of teenage angst with this funny, charming and entertaining picture. Following a similar formula to that used in Pretty In Pink, Some Kind Of Wonderful deals not only in young love thematics, but also in opposites breaking down barriers, bullies and the spectre of parental pressure. Keith (Eric Stoltz) is from humble working class stock, the idea of dating the more affluent Amanda (Lea Thompson) would seem idiotic at best. The characters may move in different circles, but Hughes, as is his want, thrusts the issue to the front whilst dangling little strands in the background. Time is given to the father (an impressive John Ashton) and son axis, where career pressure is raised. And the delightful old chestnut of fitting in at school, or not as the case may be as regards Watts (a tremendous and sensual Mary Stuart Masterton) is also putting in an appearance.

It's often forgotten in Hughes ""angsty"" films, that they aren't merely love stories for the young and restless. They are all encompassing pieces that hold up better than ever on revisits today. Yes there is pandering to certain expectations, and yes the endings never veer away from a tried and trusted method. But Hughes knew what worked for him and his audience. That he never attempted to insult us (them) with sledgehammer tactics, or trick of the twist dallying, is really rather refreshing when viewing them today. Some Kind Of Wonderful is quite simply a wonderful film, with great comedy (check out the fabulous Elias Koteas) and a banging soundtrack, it ranks as one of the finest efforts crafted from the pen of a very fine writer. 9/10",9.0

Keith (Eric Stoltz) is a high school senior in Los Angeles wherein he fights with his little sister (Maddie Corman) and is pestered by his dad about going to college. He works at a gas station and his best friend is a tomboy, Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), but he has his eyes set on a dream girl, Amanda (Lea Thompson). Craig Sheffer plays the rich stud nemesis, Hardy.  

Writer John Hughes was known for those mid-80’s high school films, like “Sixteen Candles,” “The Breakfast Club,” “Pretty in Pink” and “Ferris Bueller's Day Off.” Unsuccessful when it was released in 1987, “Some Kind of Wonderful” ended his foray in the genre and he would go on to popular comedies with John Candy and Chevy Chase. 

This movie is interesting in that it includes elements of “Pretty in Pink” (1986) and, indeed, features the ending that was intended for that movie, which the studio forced him to alter. Hughes even wanted Molly Ringwald for the role of Amanda, but she refused and Hughes took it personally, which ended their working relationship.

It’s about on par with “Pretty in Pink,” but I prefer the cast in this one, plus it’s more heartwarming. I’d watch it any day over the overrated “Breakfast Club,” yet it has its issues. For instance, some scenes have the same sense of unreality that marred “Pink” and Stoltz strikes me as too confident, charismatic and good-looking for the role of a guy that is rudely ignored by the popular girls. This would’ve never happened at my school, working class or not.

Eric Stoltz was great with both Thompson and Masterson.

Also had some fun subversion of expectations, particularly with Elias Koteas' punk character turning out to be an okay guy, plus John Ashton as the father was nice that he just wasn't the stereotypical jackass they tend to be in these teen movies.

The film begins with a teenager who stands out for his artistic ability – he draws well and also paints – and his love of automobile mechanics. He is not rich and is jealous of his wealthier schoolmates. Is it a problem of lack of self-esteem? Maybe, but things get worse when he falls in love with a beautiful, rich girl with a handsome, rich, stupid boyfriend. From then on, he will use the money his parents saved to pay for college in an attempt to humiliate his rival and impress his beloved, with the help of a friend, a drummer and rocker, who is secretly in love with him.

Firstly, the film is very moving due to its main message around love, and the way we should value and love those who truly value and love us. This is the main message of the film and what has made it work so well for decades. However, I recognize that teenage rebellion is unpleasant, especially if we are adults and tend to identify with the position of parents, who want the best for their child and know that having higher education, no matter how little it is worth, still helps to open up doors in the job market. The issue is the focal point of the relationship between the main character and her parents, but it goes unnoticed in this film, focused on rose-colored romance.

If the film does not strictly stand out for its technical qualities (absolutely the standard of films of this time), it is in the acting and cast that the film bets most safely, casting Eric Stoltz in the main role. He's young enough for the role, but mature enough to give a solid performance. Mary Stuart Masterson also does an excellent job. Much less interesting, because one-dimensional, Lea Thompson and Craig Sheffer do what they can in characters without much juice, while Elias Koteas takes advantage of every opportunity in a supporting role.",8.0

Not only that but she has the hots for school hunk Jake Ryan who, apparently doesn't know she even exists. Her existence, however, is noted by freshman Ted ""The Geek"" who lusts after her at every opportunity. Being 16 really isn't all it's cracked up to be, maybe?

John Hughes directs his first feature film and sets out his marker for the career that was to come for the astute observer of teen angst and coming of age drama.

Featuring Hughes faves Molly Ringwald (Sam0 & Anthony Michael Hall (Ted), Sixteen Candles is frothy on the outside but not without cunning substance on the inside. It's the sort of film that is easy to forgive its obviousness on account of its understanding of its characters, something that Hughes was a master of. Even as we run through the staple requirements of the teen comedy movie (dance, party, making out etc ) Hughes manages to avoid the cliché pitfalls of such sequences by fuelling them with believable patois. 

His cast, with the exception of the dull Michael Schoeffling (Jake), are sparky and engaging throughout. With the Cusack siblings, John & Joan also showing up in the strong supporting cast. There's an Asian exchange student thread that some have tried to paint as stereotypically offencive, but that is nonsense! Gedde Watanabe ensures the role is the fun and harmless one it's meant to be.

The soundtrack is kicking and very at one with the story (another knack of Hughes), it features the likes of The Specials, The Revillos, Billy Idol, The Stray Cats and The Thompson Twins. And the Evanston, Illinois location work really fleshes out the feeling of the piece.

15152,"This was a solid debut for Hazanavicius and a very fun film. There's uneven pacing, but I was very pleased with this, which seemed an interesting hybrid between the James Bond and Pink Panther film series. I loved the scoring and cinematography as well. Dujardin's character was a bit strange and the pacing was a tad uneven, but those are small flaws. This is the first of Hazanavicius' films I have seen, though I have 'The Artist' on blu. I've heard that in the sequel, he jumps a decade to the 60's--it would be interesting, if they decide to eventually continue the series, if each film could be of following decades, straight through to the present day. It was clever of the writers, through parallelism, to subconsciously suggest a linkage of the Nazis to radical Arab terrorists, so soon after 9/11, and, six years before 'Skyfall', what anyone knowing anything about espionage and counterintelligence would undoubtedly know--that all agents would probably be bisexual. I look forward to checking out Hazanavicius' other films, and hope there are eventually more in this series, for I have loved all kinds of spy films and spoofs of them, in the history of cinema.",9.0
15157,"""A Cinderella Story"" has become an iconic franchise, with the version starring Hilary Duff standing out as a standout favorite. While Duff's portrayal alongside Chad Michael Murray brought a modern twist to the classic tale of Cinderella, subsequent installments in the franchise have failed to live up to the same standard.

The franchise seems to be struggling to recapture the magic of the original film, instead resorting to unnecessary side stories and deviations from the core Cinderella narrative. It appears that attempts to replicate the success of the Walt Disney and Roger and Hammerstein versions have fallen short, leading to a sense of fatigue and irrelevance surrounding the franchise.

Despite the star power of Selena Gomez in ""Another Cinderella Story,"" the film failed to reach the heights set by Hilary Duff's portrayal. Similarly, Lucy Hale's ""A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song"" was criticized for its lackluster execution and departure from the essence of the Cinderella story.

""Sofia Carson's ""A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits"" attempted to capitalize on dance elements reminiscent of ""Grease,"" but ultimately fell flat, marking a low point in the franchise. Laura Marano's ""A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish"" was deemed the weakest link in the series, solidifying the downward trend in quality.

As the franchise continues with new installments, the lackluster reception of recent films has dampened enthusiasm for further entries in the series. Viewers may find it challenging to engage with future releases given the disappointing trajectory of the franchise.",2.0
15159,"**Frankly worse than its predecessor, despite an all-star cast that does everything they can to save the movie from complete disaster.**

After a good commercial success, the production of a second film ""Pink Panther"" was foreseeable, in an eventual attempt to resurrect the franchise that was successful thirty years ago, thanks to the talent of Peter Sellers. Despite the chorus of negative reviews, the film went ahead, but was unable to learn from the predecessor's weaknesses and weaknesses. All the salvific qualities that I observed in the previous film are still very present here, but the problems and the less positive points became even more evident.

Steve Martin continues, for me, to be one of the strengths of the film. It may displease a lot of people, but I think the actor was competent and did what was asked of him well. However, it seems to me undeniable that the material he was given to work with was weak, and the jokes designed for the character are not very interesting and do not deviate from the usual clichés of cheap and easy-going American comedies. Jean Reno and Emily Mortimer are still here, and both actors received more attention, more screen time and more relevance in this film. The two, each in their own way, play key roles in the plot and continue to do so to the best of their ability. The addition of John Cleese was really a bonus, as I felt several times that there was good working chemistry between him and Martin. The film also has good performances by Alfred Molina, Lily Tomlin, a decent (although not so good) performance by Andy Garcia, a cameo by Jeremy Irons and an unknown but sexy Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who was chosen, I think, precisely because she's beautiful.

If the level of the cast has improved, and almost everyone seems to give a reasonably decent performance, the same cannot be said for the script, a ream of paper that has not been able to give them something truly good to shine. In fact, the script is the biggest problem with the film itself: the story told is too unrealistic, too far-fetched to be logical. Starting with the simple idea of a ""dream team"" of international detectives, full of egos and vanities, but condemned to work together to solve a series of crimes, different from each other, although apparently committed by the same man! It doesn't make sense, just like stolen items, precious pieces of art or history, but impossible to generate real interest in a thief (unless the idea was to ask for a ransom on the return of the stolen object). And then there are some details that are simply not acceptable: the fact that Clouseau doesn't seem to have the slightest idea who the Pope is, for example...

Technically, the film is very similar to its predecessor: the cinematography and film work reasonably well, and Paris is a beautiful, cinematic city. Again, the opening credits are very well executed, and Mancini's melody is well-used. However, the film has almost no soundtrack beyond that, and what it does have isn't particularly good or well-used. The editing seems clumsy and the pacing of the film is awkward, inharmonious, wasting time on silly things and rushing into scenes that deserved a few more minutes. The effects aren't great, and the movie, as a whole, looks cheaper and less professional than its immediate predecessor.",4.0

It possibly doesn't help that much of the drama is set in a wet and gloomy 19th century England but Ioan Gruffudd as the pioneering abolitionist William Wilberforce comes across as weedy and lacklustre. The same can be said for Benedict Cumberbatch's Prime Minister William Pitt and for the most part this felt like a chronological history lesson instead of a drama that enthused me with the controversial issues of a debate that took all but a decade to reach a meaningful parliamentary vote. There is little of substance to what debate there was and whilst the film makes no bones about the position it takes, it does not flesh out the arguments out using rigorous discussion or characterisation to help illustrate just why it all took so long; just why the populace were indifferent to these atrocities. I found that this just overly relied on our own repugnance for the subject matter to bother developing the themes interestingly and provocatively - and I found myself struggling with it as it neared the two hour mark. A serious biopic of this visionary and dedicated man and of his friends and of his opponents would certainly make for compelling viewing - sadly, though, this isn't that!",6.0

15196,"**_An amusing take on “And Then There Were None” and “Murder by Death”_**

RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Jonathan Lynn, ""Clue"" is a comedic murder mystery based on the board game featuring an “all-star” cast (Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Eileen Brennan, Lesley Ann Warren, etc.).

This is a good movie if you’re in the mood for an amusing mystery that takes place during the McCarthy era (1954) almost entirely within a vast gothic mansion on a stormy night. It combines movies like “Ten Little Indians” (1965) and “The Beast Must Die” (1974) with the goofiness of “The Private Eyes” (1980).

I was skeptical at how Lynn & the cast could pull off the challenge of making such a confined story entertaining, but I have to admit that I busted out laughing several times (e.g. the scenes of making out with corpses). And the cast is a pleasure to behold with Colleen Camp a highlight as the stereotypical (hot) French maid. The climax with its several murder scenarios is kinda tedious, however.

15196,"Cluedo Chaos.

Clue is directed by Jonathan Lynn and he co-writes with John Landis and Anthony E. Pratt. It stars Eileen Brennan, Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, Madeline Kahn, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, Lesley Ann Warren, Colleen Camp and Lee Ving. Music is by John Morris and cinematography by Victor J. Kemper.

Based on the board game Cluedo, plot finds six guests anonymously invited to a large mansion for dinner. All of them have something in common and when their host is killed, they must work with the household staff to identify the murderer because the bodies are starting to pile up. 

A sort of madcap ""And Then There Were None"", Clue has ebullience in spades and a cast revelling in the nutty play. The mystery element is actually secondary to the interactions of this splendid array of characters, where physical and vocal humour is the twin driving force. The shifts between pure mania and deadpannery ensure the pace, even during close quarter chattings in the group, never sags. 

It's on the surface silly but taking a closer look it's rejoicing in its own humility, the class distinctions shredded for comedic worth. It's definitely a mood piece, I mean you have to be in a good move to go with its flow. For to be down and blue it's more likely to irritate than to cheer one up. The makers are on form, in front of and behind the camera, while Morris' musical score is proper perky. 

A flop on release, and mauled in serious critic circles, Clue has garnered a cult fanbase over the decades. So much so it sits with a healthy rating on the main movie data base. It's hard to recommend with great confidence, for it is an acquired taste. But it's a one of a kind from the 1980s, a pic that you should try just in case you do become a fan for life. 7/10",7.0

The former is butler ""Wadsworth"" who is to welcome a select gathering of guests to his employer's stately pile for a dinner with a difference. Once assembled, we discover that these ostensibly upstanding folks are all really miscreants and that they were all being blackmailed! Unbeknown to them, their nemesis is in their midst - but not for long, and what now ensues is a cleverly written and staged murder mystery that pits each of them against the other in an entertaining and funny ninety minutes complete with a rope and some lead piping. There are loads of quips in the pithily delivered script - some more subtle than others, and as the deductive element of the plot heats up, the characters - especially Brennan's ""Mrs. Peacock"" and Christopher Lloyd's eccentric, slightly sleazy, ""Prof Plum"" - each start to exude their own sense of chaotic, slapstick, mini-menace. By the end I wasn't quite sure who was dead, if anyone was dead, should anyone have been dead, should they all have been dead, should I have been dead? It races along just like it does on the stage, and as screen adaptations from that medium go - well, it's amongst the best.

Of course, though, those drugs trigger in ""Miranda"" (Helena Mattsson) her far more visceral instincts and with carnage ensuing it's a race against time to arrest the violent mating season. The whole thing is poor: the writing, the visual effects and the story could all have be cobbled together by some drama students after a day on the weed and the tequila.

He has been arrested by the Nazis on charges of spying and bombing, and is imprisoned without trial. His prognosis is not very good, but he is determined not to succumb to the fear and intimidation of his oppressors. One night in his cell, he observes that the door that holds him is made of oak and other, softer wood - can he find a way to escape before he faces the inevitable firing squad? It's the meticulous pace of this that is really effective. Leterrier is super as we, the audience, feel like we are sharing his daily risks. Day to day, never knowing whether he will survive. Surrounded by fellow inmates who may (or may not) be trustworthy. When he is unexpectedly saddled with a room-mate his choices and options become limited and imperative - and right to the very end, we are never quite certain as to what the denouement may bring. Mozart could never have imagined that his ""Kyrie"" and his ""Agnus Dei"" pieces could ever have been used to such chilling effects and the whole film just reeks of peril and authenticity right from the start. If you get a chance to see it on a big screen, then I'd heartily recommend you take it - it's only 100 minutes, but they are intense and compelling.",7.0
15247,"A scientist disappears from a train, a man dies. Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) is one of many investigators on the case, looking for a man named Grantby. He follows a lead to a library where he gets the feeling that something big is at stake here. After a fight with one of Grantby's goons, he returns to his captain with the bad news that he has been unsuccessful. The captain is for obvious reasons, not pleased.

In an abandoned warehouse, Palmer finds a small piece of tape with the name IPCRESS on, but at this point in the movie, has no idea what it means, if anything. Later on, though, he learns that it is an abbreviation of ""Induction of Psychoneuroses by Conditioned Reflex Under Stress"". When a scientist suddenly appears, with a strange memory loss, all the dots are about to get connected.

The Ipcress File is an old movie, but not so old that you are bored by the plot, dialogue or even images. It starts out with a mysterious disappearance from a train and a murder. Who did this and for what reasons? Then we meet a young Michael Caine, this time playing an agent called Harry Palmer, who is taken from his job on a stakeout, to investigating the murder and disappearance. He is no James Bond, and thank you very much for that. In Harry Palmer we meet a real person with real routines, real emotions and who can speak like a real person without a single one-liner. For these very reasons, this is a very satisfying movie.

I quite liked this movie, and while the colors are a bit faded and the dialogue a bit stiff, it actually felt contemporary, and the plot itself is as relevant today as it was back in 1965. The drama is not big car chases or rivers of blood, it is the drama between people, people that feel real and with real relationships. Also, the Harry Palmer character is not without humor, especially in the scenes with the young Jean (Sue Lloyd) who has been asked by her superior to learn more about Palmer.

Anyway, as his investigation progresses he starts to smell quite a large rat in his organisation and realises that neither his old nor his new boss entirely trust one another! Can he stay alive long enough to solve the puzzle? This is quite a compelling adaptation of Len Deighton's novel with Caine on top form as the almost recalcitrant man determined to discover who's the cat and who's the mouse. Nigel Green also delivers well here and once the template has been set out, this proves to be an engaging political thriller offering more than a decent indication at just how human torture can work - overtly and subliminally.

15255,"Undisputed 2: Last Man Standing is a rather ironic sequel, but I'm afraid the irony is entirely accidental. The fights here are definitely illegal, but they happen in an actual ring — as opposed to Undisputed’s Cage of Death. 

George Chambers returns to prison, convicted of a crime he didn’t commit (unlike the rape charge from the original film). After defending his cellmate, Chambers declares that ""I don't like to see people being bullied"", and although he adds ""unless I am the one doing the bullying"", it’s still a 180 degree personality change. People can and do change, of course, but seldom do they go from Ving Rhames to Michael Jai White.

In Russia to shoot a vodka commercial (if only this Isaac Florentine-directed movie had been about a down-and-out boxer à la Apollo Creed), the rejuvenated Chambers is arrested for possession of cocaine (planted in his hotel room) and summarily sentenced to Chornya Cholmi maximum security prison. Chornya Cholmi translates to Black Hills, although the hills, if any, would be more likely to be white with snow; I guess it's just a name, like 'Monster Island' (which is actually a peninsula).

This is one of those Russian prisons, like the one in Black Widow, where everyone — warden, guards and inmates alike — speaks proficient English (continuing the unintentional irony, Chambers is one of the few characters to say anything in Russian, in the aforementioned commercial), including the undisputed prison champion, Yuri Boyka (Scott Adkins). 

A far cry from the boxing of Undisputed, the name of the game here is mixed martial arts choreographed like wrestling (complete with ref bumps, which I guess is the only reason why clandestine, anything-goes prison fights would have a referee to begin with); in that sense, Adkins's gravity-defying moves are the best thing about the film, though not quite what one would expect under the circumstances (a gritty Fight Club aesthetic would be more pertinent).

Chambers starts out as a boxer, so his first matchup with Boyka is fought under a ""fists only"" stipulation. In the film’s one instance of Truth in Television, Chambers easily overpowers Boyka; the problem, however, is that White and Adkins are both consummate martial artists, so this first encounter is as underwhelming as one-legged only ass-kicking contest — that is, until Boyka stops giving a crap and starts throwing kicks and knees at Chambers, who on top of everything has been drugged by his cornerman.

All things considered, White's casting is a misfire. Rhames can't do half the things White does, but he didn't need to either; his Chambers was the irresistible force as well as the immovable object. White, through no fault of his own, has to pretend he doesn't know zilch about martial arts and then pretend that Chambers learns everything White knows about MMA in an impossibly short period of time.",1.0

Joy Division, the mercurial Manchester based masters of dark post punk sounds, who in Ian Curtis had one of the eras most tortured souls.

Directed by Grant Gee and written by Jon Savage, this documentary actually brings nothing new to the table for hardened fans of the band, of which I am unashamedly amongst that number. There is a tendency with musical documentaries to be over praised by fans simply because, well, they just love to see their idols/heroes/inspirations up there on the screen. Grant Gee's film has strong merits as an introduction for those new to the band, for the curious and to those hypnotised by tunes so hauntingly poetic they can reduce you to tears, but again for those who have followed Joy Division and their subsequent brotherhood band, New Order, there is nothing to be learned here.

The absence of Deborah Curtis (Ian's widow) from the doc is annoying, where we are only given printed quotes from her. One can only guess that she refused to be sharing screen space with her love rival, and fellow tormentor of Ian Curtis' psyche, Annik Honoré, the latter of which who is more than happy to fuel the documentary fire. At times this feels like a copy of Anton Corbijn's superb film, Control, only with the real life band members and entourage commenting from the edges of the frame. But then there is of course the live excerpts of the band, which lifts this up to the high levels set by Control and Deborah Curtis' excellent book, Touching from a Distance.

In that, there is the crux, Joy Division the film is essential for fans, to see that performance of Shadowplay and etc etc, it's these moments that make us forgive the narrative, which quite frankly, is a bit of a cash cow cash in. And I really do say that with heavy heart. 8/10",8.0

McLintock! is directed by Andrew V. McLaglen and written by James Edward Grant. It stars John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Yvonne De Carlo, Patrick Wayne and Stefanie Powers. Music is by Frank De Vol and cinematography by William H. Clothier. It's a Panavision/Technicolor production and locations used for the shoot were Nogales, Old Tucson and San Rafael Ranch State Park, Arizona, USA. A loose reworking of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, plot finds Duke Wayne as cattle baron George Washington McLintock, whose estranged wife Katherine (O'Hara) returns with daughter Becky (Powers) to the family town after a two year absence. Having left George originally on suspicion of him committing adultery, she now wants a divorce and with it full custody of Becky. George isn't keen on the idea and Katherine's arrival in town also signals the arrival of chaos.

Produced out of John Wayne's own Batjac Productions company, McLintock! became one of Wayne's most successful and popular movies of the 60's. Played for laughs, film sees Wayne surrounded by family and friends and this shines thru in the final product. It looks, and was, a fun production, its values may be dated a great deal now, but it's easy to see why the paying public warmed to it. Wayne is in his element as the tough, hard drinking and no nonsense title character, and those playing off of him are in tune with what's needed to make the comedy work. The action is well staged by McLaglen, especially a free for all punch up at a mud pit, and Clothier's photography beautifully brings the Arizona locales out from the screen. A touch too long at just over two hours, it still manages to last the course to deliver the goods for the western/comedy seeker. 7/10",8.0

Ranch hand Rocklin (Wayne) arrives in town to start his new job but finds his employer has been murdered and the locals are all a bit too shifty for comfort...

Hee, the title is rather appropriate given Duke Wayne's stature, and yet it's a title that doesn't really do justice to the pic as a whole. The plot has some nifty complexities, where simmering passions blend with a murder mystery and crooked shenanigans. 

Marin directs at a clip, never once letting the narrative sink into tedium. The action is fruity, where in spite of some crude era back projection work, fist fights, gun play and chases keep things on the boil. 

Raines is socko sexy (how nice she's not token fodder either), which acts as a counter point with Long's homely beauty, while Wayne does his thang with iconic rewards.

It's like a pet that follows and comes when called, they even play hide and seek, his schoolmates try to catch it, it even gets him into a bit of trouble with the church, it meets a blue balloon - it's even balloon-napped and they get separated which leads to an inevitable and quite sad conclusion. Or does it? It's really clever the way the balloon is manipulated - like it is remote controlled! There's also something engaging and joyous about the simplicity of this short feature.

No, it's not amazing and no the story is not an emotional journey that makes you both laugh and cry... but.

It's a video-game adaption, and you really can't go in to them thinking they are gonna blow your socks off because really, most of them aren't that great.

The 1994 Jean Claude Van Damme adaption was genuinely awful and that was pretty true to the (no) plot of the video-game so of course they had to do something different here, which I am glad they did, not just fighting all the time but an actual story.

Now of course the story does have a bunch of plot holes (but honestly what video-game adaption that doesn't?) and Chris Klein's acting in particular is pretty dodgy, he plays a tough guy cop which he tried to do again in CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE (2012) but he fails every time.

I like him fine usually but yeah he's not at all believable as a 'bad ass'.

And most of the fight-scenes are pretty well orchestrated (except perhaps the dance-club scene) and the cinematography is good and keeps at a good pace plus a pretty good soundtrack as well.

Two stars might be generous for this one, but I had a fun theater experience laughing with my friends at how unabashedly awful this movie was. Movies like this are why video game adaptations have such a bad reputation. Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li tried to make a gritty, more realistic version of the games while simultaneously using every cheesy cliche they could imagine. I can go down the list from there on how bad the acting, stunts, fighting, and costumes were. This movie felt like a bad straight-to-TV movie directed by the B-team at the CW. The crazy thing is that Capcom was heavily involved in this film and still let this disaster see the light of day.

I've noted before that musicals aren't my favourite (the more I watch, the more they grow on me to be honest), but I had a fun time viewing <em>'Newsies'</em>. It manages to maintain the entertainment whilst keeping strong focus on both the music and storyline, a lot of the musicals that I've seen tend to focus on the tunes first and almost forget about the plot, this doesn't. I thoroughly liked seeing the premise unfold.

Talking of song and dance, I rate the musical numbers. I wouldn't say I'll remember or revisit any of the songs but that's not really important, the fact that it all suits the onscreen stuff is what matters most. I do like ""Santa Fe"" by Christian Bale, who is excellent by the way. Best actor on display, though David Moscow (David), Bill Pullman (Bryan) and Robert Duvall (Pulitzer) are good too.

There are characters that seem to stick to the skin of the actor who plays them, and that's what happened with Ace Ventura. He stuck with Jim Carrey. Conceiving a film with this character without the actor who brought him to life in two consecutive films would always be a bad idea, but that's precisely what they decided to do. And how did they do it? How did the studios get around the problem? Making a movie about Ace's son rather than the father, who is conveniently killed.

The film was the target of a veritable hate campaign. People who didn't like the Carrey movies obviously had nothing to like here, and people who liked those movies might have been disappointed by his absence. I'm not going to go into campaigns or vilify the film just because. I'm going to be honest and say what I think, no matter who it hurts (that's what I always do). And I think that the film is not as bad as they say it is, and it is frankly better than “Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls”, which was for me the worst film in this trilogy. It's not a good movie, but it's not a piece of garbage either.

The secret to trying to understand this film is to peacefully accept Carrey's absence and understand that this is not a dishonest job: it doesn't seem to me that the production has tried to take advantage of the success of previous films to make money off of it. The character Ace Jr. is very similar to his father, but we also cannot assume that he will behave and act in the same way (even if this is rehearsed and the similarities are noticed). And the humor is much more familiar and friendly than before, with no embarrassing moments or situations for parents who decide to see this with their children, and that's always something I value in comedies of this type.

The film's problem turns out to be the script, very weak and incapable of detaching itself from what we've already seen in Carrey's films. Animals mysteriously disappear, stolen by malevolent minds, and Ventura will have to go find them and return them to their home. It would have been much better to have a film with something new, trying to think outside the box. Filmed in 2009, when there was already so much talk about endangered species, environmental problems and human damage to fauna, why weren't these hot topics used for a different script, more airy, different from what we've already seen?

Justin Flitter did a satisfying job in the lead role. The boy has charisma, he has sympathy, he manages to model the character, but he is obviously too young. His partner Emma Lockhart, who has stopped doing work as an actress, is limited to being a friendly face and a possible romantic partner. Ann Cusack can't do much, but she has the necessary presence, and Ralph Waite only appears because the script needed him in some very concrete moments.",4.0

It's a classic case of a family film keeping everything simple for maximum results. A big hit upon release, as was the book written by Joy Adamson, the beautiful landscapes and emotionally swirling musical score marry up perfectly with the story being told. There's some liberties taken with the facts, both with humans and lions, but we aren't in to this pic for any sort of misery or grimy drama.

I thought I dreamt about these lions when I was a kid, but when I came to know about this film that made me realise I actually saw this film when I was a very young to remember anything. It was a few images remained in memory, that's how I tracked it. So while watching this now brought back those scary moments. Yep, I was scared like hell, like the character Kendall from it was. Childhood is like a dream, until we re-encounter those things we held, met, seen, which wakes up our memory after a long time and becoming adults.

I really enjoyed watching it, because I love animals. But what I did not like was harming the animals. I don't think animals were harmed while making this film, and they even smartly censored story/scene that consists harming/killing them. Actually the film was inspired by the real story, in that, the animals were killed and that is what this film depicted, yet disappoints from that perspective. The time has changed, now it is different, we learnt our lesson, so I hope we focus on protecting this magnificent animal to be born free and to be wild.

The Africa was very beautifully portrayed. One of the best films on the wild animal theme I've ever seen. It was a documentary style narration with a little story from the human couple. Hats off to the real Joy and George Adamson. It won a couple of Oscars in the category of music and song. But I think it deserved more than that. I can't believe it is rated PG, but I scared watching it as a kid and I believe the young children with the awareness of the true nature of the lions would do the same. But still highly recommended for all ages. We have now 'Duma', 'Two Brothers' and many more, but this film is something special and you will know it after a watch.

RELEASED TO TV IN EARLY 1972 and directed by John Llewellyn Moxey, ""The Night Stalker"" chronicles events in Las Vegas when the bodies of several young women are found drained of blood. Intrepid reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) increasingly suspects that something supernatural is at foot, which his bellowing boss finds incredulous (Simon Oakland), as well as city authorities (Ralph Meeker, Claude Akins & Kent Smith). Elisha Cook Jr is on hand as an informant while Barry Atwater plays Janos Skorzeny. 

“The Night Stalker” was a hugely successful TV movie, which naturally led to a sequel, “The Night Strangler” (1973), and a series that ran for one season from 1974-1975 (20 episodes), not to mention numerous Kolchak books. This original movie was the best of the batch with “The Night Strangler” almost as good and even better in some ways. Both movies established the template (formula) for all that followed. 

What makes this movie “the best of the batch”? Answer: The streamlined story is full of intrigue, action, ravishing women, horror and suspense; and the jazzy score doesn’t hurt. As far as the women go, lovely Carol Lynley is on hand as Kolchak’s babe, but not enough is done with her. Nevertheless, there are 3-4 peripheral beauties. The sequel flick and the first episode “The Ripper” followed this pilot’s lead in the female department, but the rest of the series was rather weak on this front. 

Since this is a TV flick from the early 70s don’t expect a much gore.

There are a couple of short but good action sequences where the Night Stalker evades police cars, motorcycles, even gun fire. Kolchak manages to handle the Night Stalker a bit too easily when compared to the army of police and their failings, but that is all part of the movie's charm. Darrin McGavin as Kolchak was one of my favorite characters as a youth and I absolutely loved the TV series that followed soon after.  Kolchak is different in this movie than he is in that TV series. He's mostly interested in getting the big story so he can get a job in New York again. He doesn't seem to be friends with his boss Tony Vincenzo in this. They seem very much at odds with one another. Kolchak greases a lot of palms and swings a few deals to get what he needs to score the scoop.

I'm surprised he doesn't wear the light blue suit here. He's got the trademark porkpie straw hat, though. He also has a love interest who seems much too young and beautiful for ol' hairy Carl.

Just your average poker players... or maybe not. This is a movie afterall, so of course the characters needs to be... quirky. Also, this is clearly a comedy (and not an actual documentary, but I think you had guessed that). I kinda like these characters, flaws, weirdness and all. Oh, and there are other players as well.

The movie is not filmed entirely as a documentary, but goes back and forth between the genres. Most of the time, the camera is handheld, making for very lively images, but there are also interviews with our six main characters, where they tell their stories. In theory, it is a good idea, but in reality, it seems more like a gimmick than anything else.

As the 1980s boom for martial artists becoming filmic action stars gathered apace, Chuck Norris carved his own spot upon the testosterone fuelled wave. Much like a lot of films of its ilk, Missing in Action is of course daft, violent, jingoistic but also crucially it's a whole bunch of fun. This naturally comes down to expectation levels for a production of this type, park the brain and enjoy the cheese and carnage. It's a bit disappointing to find that we don't get to see much of Norris' martial artistry, it' s more a case of gun play and standard fists and kicks taking the lead in this one.

Thinking that his night of passion with Evelyn is purely a one off, he starts to become concerned as Evelyn refuses to leave him alone, and things are about to get very out of hand and become very disturbing for all involved.

This was Clint Eastwood's first stab (hrr hrr) at directing and it proved to be a very commendable effort as he directs himself in the picture, polishes the production across the board, and then wrapped the film on time and under budget, quite an achievement and it's no surprise that he went on to be a big hitter from behind the camera right up to this present day.

Play Misty For Me is a truly tight and engrossing picture, and certainly more of a character study than its slasher shell would suggest. Eastwood (playing against type) plays Garver perfectly weasel like, and it's because of his selfish sexual proclivities, and all round disdain for his actions, that the maelstrom that comes his way is kind of like the reckoning. The picture firmly belongs to Jessica Walter, though, her turn as the irrational psychotic in waiting, Evelyn, is truly magic, lacing sympathetic sadness with outright moments of terror, believable to the point of forcing the audience into an uneasy understanding. It's a mystery (and a crying shame) that Walter didn't go on to be a big star because the marker for major talent was right here.

It surprised the studio executives, even had them sweating about the release, but the adventures of Philo Beddoe (Eastwood) and his pet Orangutan proved to be a smash hit at the box office.

Beddoe is a trucker who also happens to make money by bare knuckle fighting, and he's very good at it. Clyde the orangutan is a full on personality himself, and between them they wind up being trailed by vengeful coppers and a very incompetent motorcycle gang. Philo's brother Orville (Lewis) is along for the ride and polar opposite love interests come into play via Lynn Halsey-Taylor (Locke) and Echo (D'Angelo). 

Plot is very thin on the ground, we are in fact viewing a series of events that are mined for comedy purpose - which totally work. Action comes by way of the punch ups Philo gets into, with Eastwood as always proving to be one of the better punch throwing actors of his generation, while Lewis shines bright as the best friend and voice of reason to Philo.

The love story sub-plot involving Lynn and Philo - and its subsequent revelations - feels a touch out of place, since this is such a chilled and relaxed comedy picture. Which is the key, the makers know what they are doing, they are having fun and ask the audience to do the same. The public lapped it up and ensured that a sequel of similar tropes would follow.

What Henry hadn't bargained for was that Becket takes the role very serious indeed and serves God to the full, so where once there was great friendship between the two men, there is now an uneasy feud.

Based on the Jean Anouilh play, Becket is as near a technically perfect film as you could wish to see, with the acting on show coming right out of the top draw. Nominated for 12 Academy Awards, it won only one for Best Adapted Screenplay (Edward Analt), but on another given year it could quite easily have cleaned up. Peter O'Toole & Richard Burton play Henry II & Thomas Becket respectively, both men feeding of each others commitment to the project to bring peerless results, witness one scene in particular as they exchange views on horseback on a British beach, wonderful stuff. The costumes, the cinematography from Geoffrey Unsworth (now booming from the screen with the DVD restoration work), the sound, and the brilliant sets all come together to make a top of the range Historical drama.

But all these would not stand out if the story wasn't any good, but Becket's triumph is in the story itself, a tale about the separation of great friends, and the separation of the state from the church, it really is an intriguing and beguiling way to spend your evening.

Thing is, he'd only gone and left the getaway car - and her - in a no parking zone and attracted the attentions of a police man (Andreas Lust) whom they leave spreadeagled on the ground as they drive away. He can still aim, though - and a tragedy strikes that sets the tone for the remainder of the drama as he vacillates on thoughts of revenge. That opportunity emerges from a most unlikely source as it transpires that his dad is pals with the cop's wife ""Susanne"" (Ursala Strauss). You can sort of guess the rest as ""Alex"" turns his initial thoughts of vengeance into something altogether more romantically complex with plenty of sex thrown in for good measure. Though it's a violent story, there's precious little actual violence in the film - it's more a roller-coaster of emotions as the man deals with an unexpectedly profound grief and regret amidst a seedy and drug-riddled environment. There isn't a great deal of dialogue which adds quite a bit to the intensely characterised and visualised roles of ""Alex"" and ""Susanne"", and we have a few welcome interventions from Johannes Thanheiser's ""Hausner"" whose estranged relationship with his son (""Alex"") also evolves quite poignantly. What you do notice after about half an hour is the music. There's isn't any. It's all natural sound, and that also gives the film some extra focus and puts way more emphasis on the quality of photography and the acting. It is too long - once you've seen a man chop a log, etc. - and could lose twenty minutes I reckon without impacting on the pace or the plot, but it's still a thriller with a difference, and is worth a watch.",7.0

Of course, the Lisbeth character is the real hero here. A rough childhood and beyond have molded her into a tough lady indeed, mentally, physically and emotionally.

A young no-class couple from central Texas (Gil Bellows & Renee Zellweger) flee from loan sharks and a maniac ex-partner (Rory Cochrane), seeking a shotgun wedding and to escape to Mexico.

""Love and a .45"" (1994) is a satirical black comedy crime flick inspired by the Charles Starkweather killing spree of January, 1958, who was accompanied by his 14 year-old girlfriend. Similar films were inspired by the same real-life episode: “Badlands” (1973), “Kalifornia” (1993) and “Natural Born Killers” (1994). Seventeen months after Starkweather’s spree he was wiped off the face of the earth via electric chair. Needless to say, we were wiser then.

While “Badlands” and “Kalifornia” were realistic, “Love and a .45” takes the satirical route à la “Natural Born Killers,” but it tries too hard to be an oddball cult flick about dirtbags, not to mention it’s shallow. By contrast, the contemporaneous “Pulp Fiction” didn’t have to try hard; it just was (the real deal; and not shallow at all). But there are enough highlights in “Love and a .45” if you don’t mind movies about white trash crazies: Zellweger never looked better, not even in “Empire Records” (1995); Cochrane gives it his all; and Bellows works as a likable anti-hero.    

The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot in the heart of Texas (Bastrop & Austin).

The execution though, well I found that really quite messy. There's three siblings.

She meets ""Tony"" (Anthony Ray) and falls completely for his charms. When he meets her brothers, however, there's an immediate sense of hostility. Not a violent one, especially, just one with pretty clear racial undertones that sets the scene for a drama to unfold in a meandering yet at times quite potent fashion. ""Leila"" finds herself caught up between her family and her lover and as the temperature gradually rises and the jazz accompaniment - trumpets particularly - gets more frenzied, this all encourages the dynamic of the story to become more turbulent and unsettling. So far, so good. It's just the acting. It's not very good nor is it very natural. There's a constant fluidity to the scenario that doesn't tally when ""Leila"" becomes smitten. It's never a plausible definite in this story of transience and movement, and way too much of the atmosphere here comes from the soundtrack - performances are almost incidental save for a few brawling scenes that seem to suggest that's mankind's solution to everything. It is innovative, I'd give it that, but John Cassavetes fails to invest his characters with any qualities that made me want to care, one way or the other, so i just didn't.",6.0

It's yet another sports drama from the studio, one of many still to come too, but it's a cut above their previous live-actions releases in this subgenre; even beating 2002's <em>'The Rookie'</em>, which I like tremendously.

I love every detail of <em>'The Greatest Game Ever Played'</em>, which is about a true story. The score is splendid, the cinematography is excellent and the premise is riveting - even to someone like me who isn't a follower of golf. There are a few scenes that use effects, namely with Vardon, which look neat.

Vardon is portrayed by Stephen Dillane, who is terrific in the role. Stephen Marcus plays Ted Ray, he's another top performer as is Josh Flitter (Eddie) - the latter brings some amusing humour to events.

The film's star, however, is Shia LaBeouf. He does a grand job as Ouimet, he produces the goods in all of his scenes. I'm already a fan of LaBeouf's, so I'm glad I can add another one of his characters to my memory.

Twelve O'Clock High features one of Gregory Peck's best performances as Brigadier General Frank Savage, a tough no nonsense martinet brought in to shake up a World War II Bomber Squadron. The men are shattered emotionally and after it's deemed that their previous commander (Gary Merrill) has been soft with them, there is no chance of that happening with Savage - but is he himself taking too much on?

Split into two parts, the first half of pic deals with how a group of men in war time can reach their lowest ebb. Fear of the jinx, fear of cracking under the strain, these men are by definition demoralised. Things are further compounded by the appointment of Savage, who drags the group further down the battered emotional scale. Second half softens things for a short while as Savage's methods begin take a hold, then there's the missions, which in turn builds to the film's revelation, which as it happens lets Peck become a revelation as well.

Director Henry King is on form, showcasing the skill of directing an ensemble cast, which sees Dean Jagger add mighty heft to the work of Peck, Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, Paul Stewart and Millard Mitchell. The flying sequences are expertly photographed (Leon Shamroy), with the real footage splicing very effective, while the writing allows the piece to exude a realism factor, which then offers up a more humane war film that is delving into psychological stings. 8/10",8.0

Captain Sindbad and his crew land on the island Colossa and come under attack from a Cyclops. Aided by the magician Sokurah and his magic lamp, they manage to escape back on board with their lives intact. However, the lamp which contains a helpful genie, is left behind in the Cyclops' hands. Once back in Bagdad, Sokurah sets about getting a crew together to reclaim the lamp off of Colossa, but the chiefs of Bagdad refuse to sanction such action. After failing to impress all with his magic tricks, Sokurah shrinks the princess of Bagdad to the size of a hand, then craftily offers to restore the princess to normal the next day. Only trouble being that the ingredients needed for the cure are of course on Colossa. So Sinbad and his men, and the dastardly magician, set sail for an adventure that is fraught with danger... 

Stop-motion maestro Ray Harryhausen, for his first film in colour, delves into the mythical legend of Sinbad The Sailor. Thus, along with director Nathan Juran, putting life into the Sinbad legacy that had been viewed as a no go area after less than favourable responses to prior attempts at the legend. Though not adhering to the Persian fable source, the 7th Voyage was nothing like this one and The Rocs for instance actually appear in the 5th voyage fable, Juran and Harryhausen turn the merchant seaman of the origin into a dashing hero figure. Someone that children and adults of both sexes can easily get on side with. 

Visually it's a treat, admire as Sinbad (in the form of a handsome sword swashing Kerwin Matthews) does battle with Cyclops', Rocs and a Harryhausen calling card, the Skeleton. Throw in a fire breathing Dragon, a genie of the lamp, a pretty princess (Kathryn Grant) and a devilishly creepy magician villain (the always great value Torin Thatcher) and the result is unadulterated joy. Some churlish folk will point to being able to see the lines between the real footage and Harryhausen's marvellous creatures, but quite frankly those people should be rounded up and sent to live on Colossa with all the other monsters. For to not appreciate the craft and genius on offer here is as sad as it is foolish. And with master composer Bernard Herrmann laying a brisk mystical flecked score over proceedings, it's a treat for the ears as well. 

When you consider the budget afforded this production, it's high quality film making, and it's now, along with the two sequels that followed it, still being enjoyed by those of us who remember before computers controlled such magical things. 8/10",8.0
15515,"I really enjoyed this film as a kid - and that's because, like in so many of these Sinbad films, the visual effects from Ray Harryhausen are great and here Torin Thatcher's efforts as the malevolent and scheming ""Sokurah"" work really well too. Kerwin Matthews does fine as the hero, hoping to be married to the princess ""Parisa"" (Kathryn Grant) until they run into the aforementioned magician whom they rescue from an island. Thing is, he really wants to get back there armed with a mighty crossbow. ""Sinbad"" is, however, completely loved up and has no intention of returning once they reach Baghdad, so the evil one conjures up a spell that turns the princess into something a little more diminutive. You help me get back to my island and I'll restore ""Parisa"" from bite size. With caliphs and their armies ready to start a war over their predicament, ""Sinbad"" is left with no choice than to trust the plotting sorcerer - and yep, betrayal looms large. What's all the fuss about? Why does he want to get back so urgently? Well - that's down to the kindly but all-powerful genie (Richard Eyer) who must obey the person who says the magic words. Can our intrepid sailor fend off his foe, restore his love and make it back against giant rocks (birds), a cyclops and a great big dragon? Well no, jeopardy isn't really the point here - but the hand-crafted, stop-motion, animation shows off well what a creative man Harryhausen was and with Nathan Juran keeping the pace rollicking along we can easily overlook the rather wooden efforts of the couple and the unremarkable writing. I love this genre of cinema, swash and buckle and action all the way - and this is a good example, well worth ninety minutes.",7.0
15516,"While a lot of people seem to praise this film as a horror gem, I myself consider it more like a drama… a mildly gruesome drama, but certainly not horror. I can enjoy horror films that don't contain some of the expected traits, like: jumps, creepy music, lots of screaming or tons of gore… but there has to be something to remind us that this is, in fact, a horror movie after all. To be honest though, there is a little bit of gore, that's true… but if the atmosphere isn't reminiscent of a horror film, the gore itself ends up being out of place. I was expecting something good, as I consider Wes Craven to be a very talented horror director, but I guess he simply wasn't in his prime back then. 

On 'Last House on the Left', the story revolves around a group of criminals, three guys and a trashy girl, who have recently escaped from prison. Two girls on her way to a concert, decide to stop by a house, looking for marijuana. The girls are kidnapped by these ex convicts, who torture them, rape them and eventually murder them in a brutal way. After butchering the two friends, the gang seeks refuge with the parents of one of the victims, who are completely unaware of everything. However, when the man of the house finds out about what happened to his daughter and who were responsible for what happened to her, he teams up with his wife to execute a gruesome revenge against his four guests.

The idea of two vindictive parents trying to avenge their dead daughter sounded promising and original for a horror film. It gives hopes for something tragic, dramatic and gruesome, but in the end, ""Last House on the Left"" ends up being more like a drama full of missed opportunities. One would expect a movie like this to reach its high point in the scene where the parents are finally able to avenge their daughter, but to my disappointment, this confrontation takes place only during the very last minutes of the film and it is shown in a very bland way. I can understand that minimalism works in certain films, and I don't expect all movies to offer some kind of gruesome shock value. The problem is that simplicity is not exactly something that one would expect from a film like this, where a certain amount of gruesomeness is almost mandatory. When the father finds out about what happened to his daughter, he looks completely numb. We never really get to see any signs of devastation, which would have added a well-placed share of drama to the story and would have made the last minutes much more powerful and tragic. My main problem with this film, however, is the fact that there are a few moments of pointless slapstick comedy. I mean, how can this be explained. It's supposed to be a horror film, but instead it is a horrible drama… with a few comedy moments? We see a girl getting stabbed and right after that, we see two dumb cops doing funny things for the audience to laugh. Honestly, I don't get it. I also find the banjo music to be inappropriate, as it works as a some kind comedy relief and it really doesn't make any sense in a movie like this. I am aware that sometimes, joyful music in horror movies is a way to create some kind of strong contrasting atmosphere, but in 'Last House on the Left', it simply sounded out of place. 

Most people seem to be impressed about the 'appalling gore' and impressive scenes, but I was mostly surprised by the lack of them. True, there are a few scenes that looked pretty brutal, but the gore is not striking enough to save the entire movie. I don't really understand what's the deal with the lame tag line that says 'To avoid fainting, keep repeating ""It's only a movie...It's only a movie...""'. I didn't find any parts to be that horrifying, to be honest. Even though I don't focus on the gore very much, I must admit that there are certain horror movies that make up for the weak plot, with a nice amount of carnage... unfortunately, this film is not one of those.

I give this movie 5 stars because even though I don't agree with the overhype, I still think it's a watchable drama with a few horror and comedy elements scattered around.",5.0
15543,"After reading and analyzing some negative reviews concerning this film, my wild guess is that ""Penny Dreadful"" turned out to be a disappointment to those who were looking forward to a movie that would desperately try to follow the ""twists in the end"" trend. It appears that many people are somehow disappointed by the fact that this film had an ending that wasn't complex or 'surprising' enough. In my case, however, as the film was coming to an end, I was hoping for a simple ending without an unnecessary twist. To my pleasant surprise, I got exactly what I wanted and the ending wasn't far-fetched and insulting like most horror films that are being released these days.

In ""Penny Dreadful"", the story is about a young girl named Penny, who has a severe fear of cars, as a result of a traumatic accident. Willing to overcome her phobia, Penny goes on a road trip with Orianna, her psychologist, as a way of overcoming her fear. During an argument, Orianna accidentally hits a hitchhiker who was walking in the middle of the road and decides to stop to help him out. When she realizes that the traveler is actually in perfect conditions, Orianna decides to give him a ride as a modest way of apologizing. Unfortunately, the hitchhiker turns out to be a raging murderer who will turn the therapeutic experience into Hell on Earth. Given the circumstances, the thing that Penny fears the most, ends up becoming her only saving shelter from the psychopath who lurks outside.

Like I stated before, one of the things that I praise the most about ""Penny Dreadful"", is the fact that there were several ways to turn the whole thing upside down towards the end and ""shock"" the audience with an ending that would make a villain out of the least expected character. ""Penny Dreadful"" is a very simple and yet compelling little film with an uncomplicated ending that despite of its simplicity, it still contains a small surprise that doesn't ruin the entire thing. I won't say it, of course... but there is one little surprise regarding the killer. I enjoyed this movie a lot, regardless of a few little things that I didn't quite get. For instance, I would have to point out the meaningless background story about a young folk having extramarital sex with a married woman and the old man who is aware of this act of adultery. It doesn't have any kind of connection to the story of Penny and Orianna. Perhaps the only reason why these three secondary characters appear, it's because otherwise, it would be ultimately uninteresting to see the hitchhiker and Penny throughout the entire film. Regarding the characters, I was glad to actually felt compelled to root for the good guys. These days, a lot of horror movies are released where the 'villains' are more empathetic, which leads to lack of interest for the main characters. Even though there were moments in which I felt like jumping into the screen and punch both Penny and Orianna for being so stupid, I felt empathy for the heroine of the story the whole time. I can't deny that she was a very irritating, but at the same time, I could empathize with her and I wanted her to survive, through a gruesome type of redemption.

If you're in the mood for an enjoyable film that doesn't desperately try to shock the audience with a ""wonderful twist"", give ""Penny Dreadful"" a chance. But most of all....brace yourself, put on your seat-belt and don't forget your breathing exercises, because this is going to be one hell of a ride!",6.0

For a festive flick, it's a little too mean-spirited.

The Cowboys is directed by Mark Rydell and adapted from the novel written by William Dale Jennings; who co-writes the screenplay with Irving Ravetch & Harriet Frank Jr. It stars John Wayne, Roscoe Lee Browne, Bruce Dern and Colleen Dewhurst. John Williams scores the music and Robert Surtees is the cinematographer. Plot sees Wayne as tough cattleman Wil Andersen, who after finding all his cowhands have fled to find their fortune elsewhere, is forced to use a bunch of green teenagers to get his beef to market. It's a journey of some distinction, for Wil, the boys and the villains who lurk on the edges of the frame.

If ever there was a John Wayne picture that was in need of serious critical reevaluation, both as a measure of his acting ability-and quality in film narrative, then The Cowboys is the one. It's a film that has been known to upset the liberal minded, where the ideology at its core has been lambasted as being objectionable in the least. Yet looking at it closely, away from the humour that does exist within, it finds the Duke at his most vulnerable, therefore believable, and at its centre it's a coming of age tale told with cynical coldness. During this cattle drive innocence will be lost, Andersen is tough and a disciplinarian, yet he's always a benevolent father figure. Wil himself hit the cattle drive trail at 13, he knows the pains and perils of such a task. He also knows that boys need to become men, especially out here in the wilderness. I'd be disappointed in a piece of Western genre cinema if it glossed over this fact. And The Cowboys doesn't, it has a sting in its tail, the trick is that the boys are not judged by how Wil taught them, but defined by a turn of events that calls on them to ""man"" up. The actions of another being the catalyst for childhood's ending.

Robert Surtees' photography paints a beautiful picture, it's pastoral, broad and appealing, but crucially it doesn't make it poetic. These young lads are entering the unknown, each section of God's great land is beautiful to us, but dangerous to them. It's an overlooked point that critics of the film ignore, that of Wil Andersen not leading these boys on a romantic trip thru the colourful terrain. It's not romantic, it's dangerous, and it's credit to Surtees that he achieves both sides of the coin; beauty and peril in the same frame. The young actors are, expectedly, a mixed bunch, but there's nothing here to be overtly negative about. Roscoe Lee Browne is terrific, his shift from wry observationalist to ""Mother Hen"" is handled with great skill, and Bruce Dern is memorable in more ways than one. The complaints come from not enough screen time for Colleen Dewhurst, who playing a bordello madame positively threatens to send the film's rating thru the roof (and the male viewers temperature's), while the running time is simply too long-too episodic-and quite frankly, unnecessary.

None of those lads are much over fifteen and few have any experience wrangling, so it’s going to be a tough challenge. Fortunately the veteran “Nightlinger” (Roscoe Lee Brown) happens by and agrees to bring along his wagon to help play nursemaid - and off they go. What they don’t appreciate, though, is that a group of would-be rustlers are in pursuit of their cows and when they discover the team doing the work are barely out of diapers, they become emboldened and set about stealing the cattle. The question is: can this motley and inexperienced team fend off the maniacal “Long Hair” (Bruce Dern) and his mercenaries? On the face of it, this could have been a disaster - but the chemistry between Wayne and Browne is a little reminiscent of his with Walter Brennan and helps steer this along quite entertainingly with decent efforts too from the lads doing the work. Interestingly, there is no sign of a Mitchum or a Wayne Jr amidst the cast of youngsters, but Nicolas Beauvy does well as do the rest as their trail turns from one of profit to one of revenge. It’s sentiment-free action film with a message of self-reliance  and independence underpinned by a tough-love style of humanity that Wayne delivers well as “Anderson” faces one of his more menacingly played foes from an on-form Dern.

Bubbly Mayim Bialik appears as the 11 year-old version of CC in the opening act while likable John Heard has a fairly notable part.

15592,"There's something quite uncanny about the resemblance between the young ""CC"" (Mayim Mialik) and Bette Midler who plays her adult self in this quite touching story of lifelong friendship. That all starts when this ordinary youngster meets the well-heeled ""Hillary"" (Marcie Leeds then Barbara Hershey) and despite being from opposite sides of the tracks, they begin to bond. The former has a love of all things showbiz but isn't exactly getting her name up in lights as she gets older. Her friend had a much better starting position and builds up a successful legal career as well as having a daughter with a man that they are both rather keen on! Things take a much more serious turn for the couple, though, when some bad news puts all of their lives in a perspective that requires both women to readjust for what's now inevitable. It's one of those stories that shows quite effectively how difficult lifelong friendships can be to maintain. They write to each other, they meet now and again, but it's never a straightforward momentum that keeps them aligned nor one that prepares them for what life throws at them. The characterisation of ""CC"" allows for Midler to belt out a few memorable numbers along the way - ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" and ""Under the Boardwalk"" maybe being the two best suited for her powerful vocals and it stays just the right side of sentiment allowing the pair to portray quite distinctly powerful characters emotionally, sometimes comically, and engagingly.",7.0

In _Alfie_, Caine plays the eponymous character, a womanising lad-about-town who cares more about with who he'll be sleeping with than where he'll be sleeping that evening.

When watched through a contemporary lens, there is something both creepy and despicable about Alfie - if any modern man behaved the way that Alfie does, he would rightly be lambasted by the #MeToo movement. But then, this is both the sexually liberating 1960's and Alfie never claims to want to be admired or looked up to.

It would be easy to say that he treats all the women badly, but there is an argument that it is the men who usually come off worse, whether he is charming another man's wife into bed, or demanding so much attention that a perfectly respectable man is barely noticed.

In fact, there are moments when Alfie's moral side appears to shine through as he suddenly become repentant of his actions, and it is impossible not to feel sorry for him. With Caine often breaking the fourth wall and delivering Alfie's inner monologues, you quickly realise that you - the viewer - are also being cleverly manipulated.

Through clever writing and Caine's irresistible roguish charm, _Alfie_ is a multi-layered comedy with an exceptionally important moral message.",8.0
15598,"Michael Caine is a bit too convincing as the sleazy, London man-about-town who only cares about having a beautiful girl on his arm (and in his bed). It isn't so much that he's a misogynist, more that sees women in only one linear fashion and as he has no use for them - or anyone else, for that matter, unless it is for his own immediate gratification. The narrative of the film takes us on his slow journey of self-realisation; he starts to comprehend the shallowness of his existence and embarks on his own yellow brick road to maturity. There are some great supporting contributions from Shelley Winters and Denholm Elliott and a cast of glamorous 1960s British models to lend credence to his hedonistic lifestyle.

15648,"A good film... I know, I'm more surprised than anybody!

For large periods of <em>'The Perfect Man'</em> I was questioning myself as to whether I was enjoying it and, evidently, I think I just about did. The acting isn't that great at all, but the humour and, most so, hearty narratives actually hit nicely - which I didn't expect.

One of my main worries throughout was how were they going to connect the plot, I liked how they were piecing it together but didn't have faith that they'd stick the landing. Unfortunately, I was probably correct as the conclusion isn't the best. However, there is still a heartwarming story sandwiched inbetween the averageness.

As mentioned, the talent onscreen isn't anything to shout about. Hilary Duff (Holly) and Heather Locklear (Jean) are the most noteworthy, as they lead an alright supporting cast. Usually these films are cast over plot, this is actually the other way around.

It most certainly scrapes into the rating I'm giving it, but I can't deny the fact that I did connect with the story between Holly and Jean which elevates it upwards.",7.0

15660,"_**Surprisingly good, sometimes great, and more balanced than its reputation**_

The life of Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) is detailed from 1939, when her career was on a downswing, to her death in 1977, focusing on her rivalrous relationship with her adopted daughter Christina (Mara Hobel & Diana Scarwid).  

“Mommie Dearest” (1981) is a ‘controversial’ drama because it dares to reveal the hidden truth about a member of Hollywood royalty, at least according to her first two adopted kids, Christina and Christopher, who have stuck to their guns in the decades since. Sure, the younger twin sisters, Cindy & Cathy, dispute the claims of gross abuse (while admitting Joan was strict), but they were only 3 years-old when Christina was 11 and so weren’t present or were simply too young to know what went down with Christina & Christopher. Another thing to consider is that Joan learned a few lessons on parenting in raising the two older kids and therefore was wiser with her treatment of Cindy & Cathy.  

The movie is neither campy nor an “unintentional comedy.” This is a dramatic biopic of the final 38 years of Joan’s life with concentration on the 40s-50s. It’s a great behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood of that period. The viewer becomes privy to Joan’s struggles with romance, maintaining success in a challenging career, aging, finances, male chauvinism and… childrearing. 

While Gene Siskel gave the movie a fair 2.5/4 rating, both he and Ebert complained that the picture was too depressing, but that is a one-dimensional perspective. Yes, the abusive episodes aren’t fun, but there are only two really bad ones, the wire hanger and the choking sequences. In other words, there’s WAY more to this movie than Joan being an abusive monster.

Speaking of which, the flick is surprisingly evenhanded with the ""Queen of the Movies.” It shows the good, the bad and the ugly, NOT just the ugly. Near the end of the story it’s clear that there was some genuine warmth and care in Christina’s relationship with Joan. The ending, however, put the final nail in the coffin (which I’m not going to reveal, even though it’s historically documented). Yet the film makes it clear that Joan believed in self-made success because she felt it created character as opposed to everything being handed to the individual. So perhaps in her mind she believed she was doing both Christina & Christopher a favor because she believed they had the talent & aptitude to make it in life just fine without any further help from her.

Some critics, including Siskel & Ebert, claimed that the movie didn’t explain Joan’s abusive tendencies with Christina (and Christopher), but it does for anyone who opens their eyes. She was a control-freak and perfectionist, not to mention she clearly developed a spirit of competition with Christina, as observed in the pool scene and, later, the soap opera episode.

Faye blamed the director for not reining her in during the two extreme scenes of mistreatment but, while these may or may not be slightly overdone, ALL biopics exaggerate things for dramatic purposes. For instance, do you think for a second that, in “Braveheart” (1995), William Wallace really trotted into a Baron’s bedchambers on a freakin’ horse for a confrontation and was easily able to escape on the horse? That said, I found those two maniacal scenes thoroughly believable. In fact, from my experience these kinds of hysterical incidents happen in practically EVERY family on occasion, hopefully very infrequently (just like in the film). For instance, I’ve had a few shameful meltdowns over the years that I wouldn’t care to elaborate on, how much more so a passionate actress juggling the demands of a Hollywood career and everything that goes with it?

Speaking of Dunaway’s performance, she was perfect for the role and shouldn’t be embarrassed by this movie in the least. Critic Pauline Kael rightly emphasized that she gave ""a startling, ferocious performance."" Furthermore, the movie was a deserved financial hit at the box office and continues to make money decades later as a cult phenomenon. Unfortunately for Faye, it was considered blasphemous to honestly criticize such an icon as Joan Crawford. Evidently people can’t handle the truth.  

The film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot entirely in the Greater Los Angeles area.

Released to TV in spring 1996, “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” was the pilot movie for the series that ran for seven years from 1996-2003. The plot revolves around Sabrina (Melissa Joan Hart) having to move from Massachusetts to live with her two eccentric aunts in Rockland County, New York, where she starts attending Riverdale High, becomes besties with Marnie (Michelle Beaudoin) and contends with requisite mean girl, Katy Lemore (Lalainia Lindbjerg). After her 16th birthday, Sabrina learns she’s a witch and grapples with the morality of having powers other mortals don’t.

The tone of the production is decidedly pedestrian in a mid-90’s TV manner, but the cast brightens things up with their energy and a decent script. (It was amusing to learn why Salem can talk and other cats can’t). I’ve probably watched a dozen episodes of the subsequent series and the main draw was always Melissa’s winsomeness. She was 19 years-old when this pilot was shot and just got more beautiful over the course of the series. For those interested, Ryan Reynolds has a significant role; he was 18-19 during filming.

15696,"This is a curious film to describe. In the best traditions of Chaucer, from whom the title is borrowed - it is a bit of an English whimsy. Not whimsical, not in any light and fluffy sense, but a story that though rooted in characterisations has something more intangible about it. This tale centres around three strangers who meet at railway station near Canterbury. ""Alison"" (Sheila Sim) is a naive, but determined land girl, ""Peter"" (Dennis Price) a British solider on a few days leave and ""Bob"" (John Sweet) - a young GI who accidentally gets off at the wrong stop. On their way to report to the town hall, the young lass is attacked by the local peril that is the ""glue man"", a mysterious individual who tips glue over the heads of women out with soldiers late at night. When they arrive, the locals try to help and they are introduced to the rather imperious magistrate Eric Portman ""(Mr. Colpeper) who pretty much runs the town. In the brief time that they have together, the three seek out this miscreant and the search turns into a modern day pilgrimage of their own as they are exposed, by degree, to the chequered history of their locale.. Each has their own journey to make, and they take us along for the enjoyable interesting ride. As we have come to expect from Messrs. Powell and Pressburger, the story has a richness to it. It interweaves their task with an evaluation of ""Britishness"" - a bucolic idyll that had largely bumbled along for centuries with little by way of profound development or intervention. Horse drawn carts, respect for the landed gentry - and the clergy - and for traditions that had long outlived their usefulness, but in which the population still had a certain faith. It's celebratory, not detracting of this society, no WWII jingoism or propaganda, just a delicately poised degree of introspection that isn't self indulgent, more evocative... The photography is superb, the acting - particularly from Sweet who epitomises the visiting forces with a mischief, a charm that is engaging and respectful; and from Price who really only wants to get back to his cinema organ. Eric Portman could be a difficult actor to appreciate - his demeanour and style frequently emotionless and staccato. Here that works, it gives him a solid base from which to evolve as his relationship with ""Alison"", herself charmingly and determinedly played by Sim - grows. It sort of has a narrative to it, but that's not really so important. Don't expect this to follow any established pattern - it's unique and a grand film to watch.",7.0
15697,"""That ain't tactics honey, it's just the beast in me.""

Elvis Presley plays ""Vince Everett"" who goes to jail after accidentally killing a man in a bar fight. While in the big house he is paired in his cell with Hunk Houghton (Mickey Shaughnessy), an ageing country singer whose best days are behind him. The pair strike up a friendship and Houghton teaches Everett to play the guitar, however, it's apparent that Everett is all about the voice. Recognising this fact, Houghton is quick to strike up a contract with Everett so that once both are on the outside they can make some money in the music industry. Paroled well early into his stretch, Everett meets Peggy Van Alden (Judy Tyler), a record company talent scout, who eventually gets won around by Everett and they record a song. Although there are initial problems with the industry, the song takes off after the pair set up their own record company. But with fame comes internal conflict and Houghton is now released and wanting to call in on his and Everett's prison contract. 

Chances are that if you asked a group of film lovers to name an Elvis Presley motion picture, the majority would say Jailhouse Rock. Now that's not to say that is because it's the best film from The King because that would be King Creole or Flaming Star. Or that it's the most fun film of the 31 pictures he made, because that would be Viva Las Vegas. Its standing probably has more to do with the title song than the actual film itself. Which is actually a shame because although Jailhouse Rock is a weak film in many ways, it's also a film where Presley got to play a moody, rebel like character. The like of which we would not see again. This was Presley's third feature length film, and the first for MGM. Shot in black & white by Robert J. Bronner, it's directed by Richard Thorpe and penned by Guy Trosper out of a story by Nedrick Young. 

The problems exist within the weak plot that has holes the size of Leavenworth Prison. Characters come and go without any purpose or meaning and Thorp uses shortcuts to keep the film's running time as trim as Presley's waist line was here. Yet to me these are forgivable issues as Presley embraces his rebel with a heart and gives it the full tilt lip snarling treatment. His Vince Everett is the guy that girls want to bed (lots of Elvis bare torso here girls) and the guy that guys want to be. And of course there is also a great set of songs and the choreography to lap up at every other turn. Along with the famous and quite brilliant title song we also get ""Treat Me Nice,"" ""Baby, I Don't Care,"" ""I Want To Be Free,"" ""Don't Leave Me Now"" and the sublimely tender ""Young & Beautiful"". The latter of which stops this particular viewer in his tracks and instils a warmth that normally only Judy Garland gives me when warbling over the rainbow. Yes I love this film in spite of its obvious failings. 

The sad footnote to the film concerns co-star Judy Tyler who along with her then husband, Greg Lafayette, was killed in an automobile accident a couple of weeks after filming had finished. Thus never even getting to see the film released. Elvis was shattered and is said to have never watched the film as it would have been too painful. So as Elvis sings ""Young & Beautiful"" it becomes, one feels, a fitting tribute to a young actress cut down in her prime. In 2007 a Deluxe edition of the film was released on DVD, remastered in sound and picture, it's a triumphant release that really does the film justice. For now, Elvis, Judy and those wonderful songs, have never looked or sounded so great as they do now. 8/10",8.0

A young construction worker (Presley) is sentenced to a year in the state penitentiary for manslaughter, but wisely takes advantage of his time learning to play guitar better from an inmate who was formerly a county & western performer (Mickey Shaughnessy). After meeting a promoter when he gets out (Judy Tyler) and facing several challenges, he’s a hit.      

“Jailhouse Rock” (1957) was Elvis' third movie of the 31 he did, but it was his second starring role. This one has a similar plot to the previous “Loving You,” released earlier the same year, except for the ex-con angle. Despite the flat B&W photography, it’s superior due to the iconic title song performance and the fact that the last act is more compelling. 

I’d put it up there with Elvis’ better early flicks, like “Wild in the Country” (1961), ""Blue Hawaii"" (1961), ""Kid Galahad"" (1962) and “Roustabout” (1964). It best conveys the charisma that attracted fans by the millions in the 50s-early 60s.  

While Judy Tyler and 2-3 other women are certainly lovely, they don’t beat the top females to costar in Presley movies, such as Anne Helm in ""Follow That Dream"" (1962), Ann-Margret in ""Viva Las Vegas"" (1964) and Michele Carey in ""Live a Little, Love a Little"" (1968). I’d cite the ‘banana dancer’ in “King Creole” (1958), but it was only a bit part.

The buddy buddy action/comedy cop formula has proved to be a most viable filmic commodity over the years. It gathered apace in the 1980s and right at the forefront is this often forgotten fun little treasure.

Plot has Hines and Crystal as Chicago cops, tough and full of wise cracks, they are tasked with trying to bring down high profile drug dealer Julio Gonzales (Smits). The timing is unfortunate because after a holiday in Key West the boys decide they have had enough of police work and want to retire there. Can they bring down Julio Gonzales? Can they stay alive in the process? Questions to be answered in an entertaining hour and forty five minutes.

The chemistry between Hines and Crystal is set in stone, they are a great pairing and very quickly you warm to them. As per genre requirements some of their character's methods are unconventional. the gags are thick and fast, and crucially very funny - while the support slots are nicely filled (Pantoliano a joy).

In the mix as the two cops ponder retirement is the looming presence of two younger cops ready to step into their shoes, which of course makes for sparky rivalry. There's the emotional beat of ""the ex-wife"" as a critical plot development, though amazingly Fluegel is under written and hardly in the piece! And Smits never fully convinces as the chief villain, but he also is weirdly under written.

One, the movie doesn't necessarily hold up well (in terms of writing, acting, pacing, story, etc.) but in many ways that doesn't matter in terms of whether it's worth watching. It's probably a more important film than it gets credit for. It's hard to understate how groundbreaking this film was for the time, offering  onscreen representation and voice to several underrepresented segments and experiences in society. By today's standards, the romance feels a little Hallmark and Lifetime movie-esque, but in the moment, it was unheard of for a movie like this to have the reach it did with the message it had.

I found that to be quite an useful introduction to this film version of Gilbert and Sullivan's 1870s operetta; it made it clear that this was going to be a stage version on film, rather than any attempt to recreate the story for the cinema. Expectations suitably set - it goes off on a pretty enjoyable romp through this (mixed with one or two other of their works) story of the young ""Frederic"" (Rex Smith) who has been doing a sort of youth opportunities scheme with a band of ruthless pirates led by Kevin Kline. To stave off this imminent destruction, and the capture of his daughters - the ""Maj. General"" (George Rose) appeals to their sense of pity by declaring that he is an orphan, and that they wouldn't want to leave an old man lonely and bereft in his latter years. Their evil hearts melt, and his daughters (and the town) are spared. ""Frederic"" has an encounter on the beach with the beautiful ""Mabel"" (Linda Ronstadt) - one of the daughters of the old solider and they both fall head over heels in love and all looks set fair. Snag? Well the poor soul was born on the last day of February in a leap year, and has had actually only had five (not twenty one) birthdays - so the terms of his indenture mean he must serve another 60-odd years with the pirates! Luckily for him, ""Mabel"" agrees to wait for him and what ensues now are a series of gently comedic escapades as their love story develops, and the ""Maj. General"" and ""Pirate King"" come to a perilous reckoning before the very timely intervention of Queen Victoria. Accomplished theatre actress Angela Lansbury features, importantly but sparingly, as the deaf old nurse ""Ruth"" and Tony Azito is quite entertaining as the ""sergeant"" too. G&S purists might not appreciate the slightly hybrid nature of this effort, but I rather enjoyed the wobbly sets, the scenery clearly made of polystyrene and papier-mâché and the tightly shot photography - it is offering us a variety of theatre seats to watch it from, but we are never in doubt that this is essentially still a stage production. Kline and Smith are on fine form, the latter really takes the part by the scruff of the neck and even though his voice is not quite what it might be, he gives it everything he can and his enjoyment, his daft love scenes and songs with the Golden Globe nominated Ronstadt, along with a soupçon of swash and buckle and plenty of camp humour all keep the momentum moving along nicely. The song of the film is ""Model of a Modern Major General"" but the patter song works really well too.

15720,"At a relatively modest 106 minutes The Man from Elysian Fields is still a little too long – and yet I can see why director George Hickenlooper would hesitate to edit out the scenes where Mick Jagger shares screen time with Anjelica Huston. 

These scenes add nothing and lead nowhere, but darn it, they have Mick Jagger and Anjelica Huston in them. The problem is that the Jagger character is little more than a narrator, and should exist only to introduce Andy García into the world of male escorting; whatever he does in his spare time, and with whom he does it, has no bearing whatsoever on the plot and is therefore of zero interest to the audience.

Anyway, luckily for Andy, though rather unbelievably in general, his experience as a glorified gigolo involves one single solitary customer who, as expected, is rich and lonely, but also very beautiful and about his same age, and to cap it all, married to his hero, played by James Coburn, who not only is quite at peace with his wife procuring herself a sexual surrogate, but also willing to let García help him rewrite his next novel. Uh huh.

Improbabilities aside, the whole triangle business is the best part of the movie (with Coburn effortlessly evoking a rugged, Hemingway-esque manliness), and its potential for both dramatic and comedic material renders García’s previously established domestic life disposable were it not that the script needs it to provide the sappy happy ending (and that Hickenlooper couldn’t bear to part even with Julianna Margulies goes a long way in explaining his attachment to Jagger and Huston).

The time devoted to either sub-plot would have been better spent monitoring Garcia's progress as a writer. No doubt his bittersweet experiences with Coburn and the latter's wife would provide him with much better material (not to mention a solid tree to lean against, in terms of professional learning) than his previous novel, a sub-Ira Levin thriller called Hitler's Child; however, the characters are authors only nominally, and the extent of their literary collaboration is reduced to substituting one ""microcosm"" for another (migrant workers instead of Roman slaves).",4.0

It was the second of his three flicks shot in Hawaii, the other two being ""Blue Hawaii"" (1961) and “Paradise, Hawaiian Style” (1966). While it’s a serviceable Presley flick and has its points of interest, it’s the least of the three IMHO with “Blue Hawaii” being easily the best.

The serious drama is situated amongst the Hawaiian boating/fishing industry wherein Presley performs a song every 7-12 minutes with “Return to Sender” being a highlight. 

Stevens' role is rather small so the focus is on the protagonist's romance with the secretly rich girl. Speaking of whom, two years later Goodwin played Yeoman Colt on the original (rejected) pilot episode of Star Trek, which was reworked into the two-part episode ""The Menagerie,"" premiering in November, 1966. While Stevens and Goodwin are a’right, the female cast in “Paradise, Hawaiian Style” is superior.

There’s an interesting scene near the end where Elvis’s character is rescuing the girl and a sailboat runs into their smaller craft. The (presumable) stunt people in the motorboat get hit by the sailboat and somewhat pushed under.

The movie runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Hawaii.

15741,"""Dorothy Mills"" is one of those films that may not fit into the horror category, but it still contains enough elements to get the attention of horror lovers who want more than gore and a nice variety of scares. I admit that I also like those kinds of horror films, but I can also acknowledge and praise something a little bit more complex, less violent and more 'psychological', which is the case of this film. 'Dorothy Mills' certainly went beyond my expectations and I honestly don't understand why some people are complaining about the movie being 'too slow'. For the contrary, this film successfully manages to capture the attention during the first minutes, which is a crucial thing to do when you're telling a story. If you shock the audience enough during the first minutes and develop a well narrative line that gets more and more complex throughout the end, you're all set, and personally, I think Agnès Merlet and Juliette Sales achieved this perfectly.

I don't know anything about Jenn Murray, the young actress who portrayed Dorothy Mills. I am not acquainted with her earlier work, but I don't need any information to state that she is definitely one of the most gifted actresses I have seen in a long time. The first time we see Jenn on screen, her character is doing something extremely violent, which provokes repulsion and hate towards her. However, only a few minutes later, Dorothy suddenly appears as a poor innocent child, which causes more sympathy than fear or rejection. Jenn Murray is obviously gifted enough to elaborate a complex character, who never ceases to amaze the audience with a variety of types of behavior through the entire film. Dorothy is a flawless character, not only thanks to Jenn Murray, obviously, but also because the writers did a marvelous job creating her. Judding this film by the cover, one would be inclined to assume that 'Dorothy Mills' is another movie about a bad little girl who kills people and gets away with it because nobody ever suspects of young innocent little girls. Well... this is really not the case. The cover is misleading and it makes it makes it look campy, when in reality, Dorothy is a much more complex character with a lot of things to express. Again, I have a special love for campy films as well, but I'm just stating a difference, in this case.

I highly recommend this fine psychological thriller, with one of the most complex 'villains' I have seen in a while. If you're in the mood for a good thriller with some well done twists, give this movie a chance.",7.0
15762,"What is this? A homicide, or a bad B-movie?

Not exactly what you would call an unknown horror comedy, but there is the distinct feeling that it should be better known. As its cult fan base will attest, this is blast of a movie, a homage to the ""B"" schlockers of lore. Directed by Fred Dekker, the premise sees some alien beings eject a flask of alien slugs down to earth, which lands at a fraternity campus, something which cause mayhem some years later when a frozen body is disturbed at the medical lab and the slugs are unleashed. Cue infestation that turns people into zombies!

The pic plays up to the clichés of fraternity based movies, with nerds and nudity on tap, all smothered in a gooey horror comedy sauce. One-liners are ripe, the characterisations also, the latter of which fronted by a glorious Tom Atkins as a hard drinking hard - boiled detective with issues and quips ready to be poured out. It's not genius film making, but given the low budget it deserves its cult status, because it never pauses for breath and it's very aware of what it wants to be - and crucially who its target audience is. 7/10",7.0

During a frat initiation, two buds at a SoCal university (Jason Lively and Steve Marshall) inadvertently unleash something creepy that results in the walking dead. Tom Atkins plays the detective on the case while Jill Whitlow draws the attention of one of the boys. 
  
“Night of the Creeps” (1986) is sci-fi/horror with a wink of amusement that features bits from previous movies, like “The Blob” and zombie flicks, to forge its own unique concoction. The writing is creative, the characters are fleshed-out and the director has a good eye for women in a few quick spots (not talking ’bout nudity or sleaze). The detective especially is an interesting character while Whitlow’s voice is to die for.   

This would obviously influence “Slither,” which came out two decades later, but “Creeps” is the superior film, by far (there’s something distasteful & ugly about “Slither,” but that’s just me).

The movie runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot entirely in Los Angeles.

15764,"Not long after the end of WWII, we meet ""Stingo"" (Peter MacNicol) who isn't exactly impressed when he encounters his new upstairs neighbours. ""Nathan"" (Kevin Kline) seems to be a bit of an noisy and brutish oaf towards his girlfriend ""Sophie"" (Meryl Streep). Luckily, next morning peace has broken out and they climb in his window to invite him on a seaside picnic. He's a budding writer, and what he clocks quite early is the volatility of ""Nathan"", a Jewish man who seems to have a great deal of emotional baggage. She, on the other hand, is much more considered and sedate - and that's the shield that he is determined to penetrate. Once he does and she begins to open up to him, we discover that she is an holocaust survivor and has had to make some horrendous decisions in her life just to stay alive. It's this latter, intimate and frightening, stage of the film that really showcases Streep's abilities to convey a palpable sense of fear. Sure, the accent isn't maybe the best but the scenes in the camp, the terrors and the anachronism of the commandant's relatively luxury home and happy family - where she ends up working in domestic service - being only yards from the scene of such brutality is also well, subtly, presented. Every now and again we come up for air - to their present day - to recalibrate the story and advance the more contemporaneous storyline before we dive deeper for some more of just what happened in Europe in the 1940s. It's another of those films where the victims of this villainy are the ones who want/need/have to forget whist others are fascinated by their experiences and want to know more. From that perspective, MacNicol plays his part - increasingly treading on the psychological eggshells - well, especially as the dynamic between them begins to shift. Kline doesn't disappoint, either. His annoyingly neurotic character isn't always the most likeable, but as a vital piece of this powerfully scripted jigsaw he adds a potent dimension to sentiments of guilt, grief, anger and regret that prevail as the story builds up an head of steam. It's a stylish, Gatsby-esque, looking production and brims with humanity, humility and some very dark humour on occasion, too. Not an easy watch, but stories like this never grow old.",7.0
15765,"**A discreet biographical film, that seems to me to fulfill its role.**

Even those who don't like her, I think, have the honesty to recognize the impact and relevance of Tina Turner's music. She doesn't please everyone (nobody pleases everyone) but it is still a reference in 20th century music. Owner of a record that is hard to match, she has several awards, several Grammys and two stars on the Walk of Fame, among other honors. The film we have here, heavily based on the singer's autobiography, shows us a little of her personal life, how she became famous and her difficult marriage to Ike Turner.

I never read the original book, but I believe the movie omits a lot of information and data to try to focus on the main thing. Brian Gibson ensures an efficient direction and the script is quite good, mainly because of the way it sticks to the story and facts, avoiding melodramas and cloying sentimentality. Of course, not everything goes smoothly: the film is quite predictable, and its pace, although pleasant, goes through several bumps that are basically musical pauses.

The most relevant point in favor of this film is the excellent choice of the cast and the impeccable way in which it acts. Lawrence Fishburne has the difficult task of bringing the truculent Ike to life (and there aren't many characters more disgusting than an abusive husband), but he put in such effort that he manages to capture our attention with magnificent charisma. Beside her, the great Angela Bassett never seemed so powerful and electrifying. Incidentally, the resemblance of the two actors to the real figures they embody is truly remarkable.

The film has excellent cinematography and good scenery. The costumes, props and even automobiles play an important role in building the atmosphere of the time in which things are happening (between the 50s and the beginning of the 80s). The soundtrack is also good and, predictably, it's basically based on songs by Tina Turner and Ike Turner.",5.0
15765,"Andrea Bassett provides quite a compelling interpretation of the early life of Tina Turner here and Laurence Fishburne is also on good form as the brutish Ike. Born Annie Mae Bullock, she grows up in a community where singing is important and where her voice helps her to stand out. Pretty swiftly she attracts the notice of local band leader Ike Turner who gives her a start fronting his music before she becomes his wife and a mother. Success begins to follow but as that happens he turns into a monster. She is beaten regularly and feels more and more intimidated and fearful within her own marriage. Her society just wasn't geared up for a woman to leave her husband, however violent, and so with their business and family lives so completely intertwined any chance to break free was always going to be dangerous for this woman. Peppered with some well staged performances of their songs, and concluding with the birth of a legend, this is one of the more honest biopics that spares us little of the detail of a relationship riddled with turmoil and little respect. Fishburne presents us with a man who is odious in the extreme, but also one who exudes a degree of vulnerability as he clearly takes to drink and drugs to compensate for her success and his perception on how that impacted on his manhood to some extent. Not to excuse the behaviour - it seems commonplace for many African American women to have been the victims of domestic violence, but it does humanise the man a little and that does help to illustrate both the boldness and determination of an hugely talented and strong woman to do what she had to to break free of his magnetically toxic influence. It's based on her own book, and that adds a considerable degree of authenticity and richness to a depiction that's tough to watch at times, but well worth it.",7.0

White Heat is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted by Ivan Goff & Ben Roberts from a story suggested by Virginia Kellogg. It stars James Cagney, Virginia Mayo, Edmond O'Brien, Steve Cochran & Margaret Wycherly. Music is by Max Steiner and photography by Sidney Hickox.

Cody Jarrett (Cagney) is the sadistic leader of a violent and ruthless gang of thieves. Unnervingly devoted to his mother (Wycherly) and afflicted by terrible headaches since childhood, Cody is one bad day away from being a full blown psychotic. That day is coming soon, and everyone in his way is sure to pay.

Around the time of White Heat being released, two things were evident as regards its star and its themes. One is that it had been a long time since a gangster, and a truly vicious one at that, had thrilled or frightened a cinema audience. The Production Code and a change in emotional value due to World War II had seen the genuine career gangster all but disappear. Second thing of note is that Cagney was stung by the disappointing performance of Cagney Productions. So after having left Warner Brothers in 1942, the diminutive star re-signed for the studio and returned to the genre he had almost made his own in the 30s. He of course had some say in proceedings, such as urging the makers to ensure a crime does not pay motif, but all told he needed a hit and the fit with Raoul Walsh and the psychotic Jarrett was perfect. It may not be his best acting performance, but it's certainly his most potent and arguably it's the cream of the gangster genre crop.

The inspiration for the film is mostly agreed to be the real life criminals: Ma Barker, Arthur ""Doc"" Barker and Francis Crowley. A point of worth being that they were all 30s criminals since White Heat very much looks and feels like a 30s movie. Cagney for sure is older (he was 50 at the time) and more rotund, but he and the film have the presence and vibrancy respectively to keep it suitably in period and in the process becoming the last of its kind. White Heat is that rare old beast that manages to have a conventional action story at its core, yet still be unique in structure and portrayal of the lead character. Neatly crafted by Walsh around four Cody Jarrett ""moments"" of importance, the Oedipal tones playing out between Cody and his Ma make for an uneasy experience, but even then Walsh and the team pull a rabbit out the hat by still garnering sympathy for the crazed protagonist. It sounds nutty, but it really is one of the big reasons why White Heat is the great film that it is. Another reason of course is ""those"" special scenes, two of which are folklore cinematic legends now. Note legend number 1 as Cody, incarcerated, receives bad news, the reaction is at once terrifying and pitiful (note the extras reaction here since they didn't know what was coming). Legend number 2 comes with ""that"" ending, forever quotable and as octane ignited finale's go it takes some beating. 

As brilliant and memorable as Cagney is, it's not, however, a one man show. He's superbly directed by Walsh, with the great director maintaining a pace and rhythm to match Cody Jarrett's state of mind. And with Steiner (Angels With Dirty Faces/Casablanca/Key Largo) scoring with eerie strands and strains, and Hickox (The Big Sleep/To Have and Have Not) adding noir flourishes for realism and atmosphere, it's technically a very smart picture. The supporting cast in the face of Cagney's barnstorming come up with sterling work. Wycherly is glorious as the tough and tetchy Ma Jarrett and O'Brien is needed to be spot on in the film's second most important role; a role that calls for him to not only be the first man Cody has ever trusted, but also as some sort of weird surrogate mother! Mayo isn't called on to do much, but she's gorgeous and sexy and fatalistic in sheen. While Cochran holds his end up well as the right hand man getting ideas above his station.

White Heat is as tough as they come, a gritty pulsating psycho drama that has many visual delights and scenes that are still as powerful and as shocking some 60 odd years since it first hit the silver screen. What is often forgotten, when yet another clip of the brilliant ending is shown on TV, is that it's also a weird and snarky piece of film. All told, it is blisteringly hot. 10/10",10.0

The Burrowers is written and directed by J.T. Petty. It stars William Mapother, Sean Patrick Thomas, Clancy Brown, Laura Leighton, Doug Hutchison, Karl Geary and Robert Richard. Music is by Joseph LoDuca and cinematography by Phil Parmet.

August the 11th 1879, the Dakota territories, and after a family of pioneers are abducted a posse is formed and go off in search of the culprits. It is believed they have fallen prey to hostile Native Americans, but once out in the wilds the truth hits home and the posse find themselves in a brutal and bloody fight for survival.

It's not like Tremors! That wonderful homage to the B movie creature features of the 1950s is played for laughs and action thrills. The Burrowers admittedly on plot synopsis' does lend one to think that a fun packed creature feature is in the offering, but as many unaware film fans have found out, this is far from being the case.

I would rather walk in the right direction than ride with my head up my ass.

The Burrowers takes itself seriously, and not insultingly so. J.T. Petty wanted to make a Horror/Western but not in the schlocky sense. He even infuses the narrative with some human concerns and statements, ecologically and racially so.

The pace is very, very deliberate, so potential first time viewers need to take that into consideration. Once the plot is kick started in the opening salvo, the posse go out into the wilds and interact, for better and worse, dialogue is sharp and pointed, intelligent even.

A number of great character based scenes are setting the tone for what is a downbeat picture, while when the action comes in tantalising spurts, it's well marshalled by Petty, and it's not just all about the creatures either.

The look is of a classical Western, which considering the modest budget is quite some achievement. From costuming and props, to the colour palette, the film convinces as the Old West of 1879. In this regard it would have been very interesting to have seen Petty make a standalone Oater.

Practical effects are very decent and CGI is wisely used sparingly, though the big showdown at pic's end is something of a let down. Elsewhere Sir Clancy of Brown and Doug The Thug Hutchison are sadly under written, though the face fuzz department scores high marks!

The Leroux source material has been adapted a number of times. This version sees Universal update their own 1925 silent version that starred Lon Chaney, and give it a Technicolor make over whilst practically making it a musical picture. Even making it a light comedy in parts! It is undeniably a gorgeous picture, both visually and aurally, for the sets and operatic tunes alone this could never be called a dull movie.

""The Bridge at Remagen"" (1969) is a WW2 film loosely based on real-life events similar to the later “A Bridge Too Far” (1977), but with a lesser cast, albeit more streamlined and colorful, like the contemporaneous “Castle Keep,” but less artsy and more straightforward. It may not be great like “Where Eagles Dare” (1968) or near-great like “Kelly’s Heroes” (1970), but it’s solid and fills the bill if you’re in the mood for WW2 movie from the European theater.

The film unit was amusingly accused by the Soviets & East German press of smuggling weapons into the country, supposedly being a cover-up for the CIA.

You hear the names John Ford and John Wayne and one automatically thinks of Westerns, sprawling landscapes and machismo in bunches. Odd then that their last collaboration should be a knock about comedy set on a paradise isle. Perhaps even odder is that it should turn out to be one of their most entertaining films. Donovan's Reef finds the two Johns in very relaxed mood, as is the rest of the cast I might add. A cast that includes Lee Marvin, Mike Mazurki, Jack Warden, Cesar Romero, Dorothy Lamour and the lovely Elizabeth Allen.

Speaking personally, I found the film far more rewarding by not knowing much about it before hand, I really only ventured into it out of loyalty to the Johns and the Marv. So in that, this isn't much of a review as such, because I would simply urge people to give it a go. Why you ask?, well because it's one of those films that can brighten your day when things have gone dark, you got The Duke and The Marv slugging each other at regular intervals, not in the normal way associated with these guys, but jocular-with this biff bang machismo comes laughs a plenty. We have Romero and his beard on prime slime mode, Allen as delicious as she is prim and proper and the Kaua'i location work gorgeously realised by William H. Clothier's photography. It's not just a comedy either. Under the mirth we find Ford dealing in thematics such as anti-racism, anti preconceptions and one of his pet leanings of brotherhood.

Donovan's Reef is a smashing film, it's far from perfect, something the principals were aware of. But in the end it's obvious that all involved just said to hell with it, lets enjoy it and hope the audience buys into that attitude as well. One can only hope that you do buy into it, and thus get as much fun from it as yours truly most assuredly did. 8/10",8.0

Well, it's certainly a bit like ""Conan"" and a bit like countless other films as we see the eponymous hero (Rick Hill - surely a porn name?) sent on a quest. He must retrieve a sword from a witch and then challenge the evil sorcerer ""Munkar"" (Bernhard Erhard) for possession of a chalice and an amulet that give him astonishing powers. Only when he has all three can he destroy them and bring peace to the Kingdom. What now ensues is actually quite fun. No, not good - not even nearly good, but he parades around in his leather trousers whilst director James Sbardellati waves scantily clad female warriors, dancers and mud wrestlers in his face. Needless to say his leather clothing has been super glued to his body, but the girls - well they might as well be wearing crepe paper. Anyway, there isn't the slightest degree of jeopardy here as our hero slowly, but surely, earns the right to win the ""Big Tournament"" (think Wimbledon with a mace and chain). ""Munkar"" belongs in a Hammer/""Carry-On"" film, exuding all the menace of a butterfly and the acting, well that is universally as bad as the writing.

15925,"Fall in for the blood pumping joy of De Havilland's Mosquitoes.  

A WW2 squadron of Mosquito bombers are training for a perilous mission to bomb a cliff face in Norway; with the aim to bring the cliff tumbling down on the German arms factory below it.

633 Squadron may not be a film for the War enthusiast purists? But the work done here to make this film a winner should never be understated. In this day and age it's often forgotten how these type of film's relied on good aerial photography, deft model work, and a stirring score. All of which this picture contains, thus making 633 Squadron more than a wet day crowd pleaser. Sure the intermittent scenes between the training sequences and the actual mission are mere filler, and the subplots obviously halt the flow of the movie (hello romance, hello sacrifice clichés); but what they do do is give a sort of added feel to the proceedings come the mission at the end. We do after all have to have some sort of affinity with the characters putting their lives at risk, and we get that here courtesy of a well written first half. Also boasting (in my opinion naturally) one of the greatest scores used in a War movie, courtesy of Ron Goodwin, the film triumphs because the ending is all that you hope for. In truth it's never in doubt given the build up we are given (and being the normality for many genre pieces), but with little dashes of poignancy and slivers of adrenalin rushes, the impact is akin to a jingoistic chest thudding.

George Chakiris (not too long after his success in ""West Side Story"") and Cliff Robertson take the lead in this quite stilted, but well made wartime drama.

15927,"**Although the film does justice to the colorful and rich Indian universe, it is a missed opportunity given the poor script construction.**

This film is the last of director David Lean's career, a filmmaker who gave us a series of good films, being “Lawrence of Arabia” and “Doctor Zhivago” the best of all, for me. Here, the filmmaker brings us an adaptation of a novel I've never read, but which must be quite good: set in India during the interwar period, the story begins with the arrival of two Englishwomen, one of whom, Miss Quested, is engaged to a local English judge. Over time, they befriend Aziz, a Muslim doctor. Quested already had the will to live something adventurous, to feel the taste of India, but was always disappointed by her compatriots, who labeled Indians and preferred to emulate, in that country, the habits and environments of British society, without any “dangerous” mixture with people of a ""darker race"" and more ""barbaric"" culture. Finally, Quested gets Aziz to prepare an exploration on some distant caves, but the trip goes wrong, something happens, and Quested goes to accuse Aziz of attempted rape.

I think that the film turns out to be a rather weak adaptation: dazzled by the oriental environments, Lean missed the most incisive themes of the plot: the ethnocentric relationship, full of prejudices and mutual mistrust, between the English and Indians; the political issue of Indian independence (which becomes relevant as the plot evolves); the mystery surrounding what really happened between Quested and Aziz, since the novel never clarifies whether her accusation is true. These themes are very poorly aligned by the script: in the film, it is obvious that Aziz is innocent, and Quested is turned into a frivolous, amorphous and unhappy woman, unsure of what she wants from her life and desirous of a strong emotion that social conventions don't allow her; secondly, the script never values the independence issue, turning it into a footnote, merely contextual; thirdly, despite the fact that the film deals quite well with British racist ethnocentrism, it almost does not address the way in which Indians saw the British, and the way in which they felt offended by their excesses. Everything is very relativized.

In addition to the script problems, the film is also excessively long. Everything is stretched to the maximum, and many minutes are lost in magnificent and well done scenes that add nothing to the story. A lot of time is lost, even, in rather frivolous dialogues, while the legal battle, the most interesting part of the film, is secondary. And instead of the film ending right after the final decision, with a few scenes that enclose the fate of the characters, the film still stretches for a barren half hour, until an anticlimactic and uninteresting ending.

The actors do what they can, and we have some good efforts here: Victor Banerjee is the most eminent actor, the most magnetic and charismatic figure, showing us the evolution of his character's ideas, whose opinion of the British gradually degrades with the events. Peggy Ashcroft also made a good effort, but the script sidelined her to the point of becoming an accessory. The same can be said of Sir Alec Guiness, wasted on a marginal work of no particular relevance. James Fox appears more or less in the middle and the plot suggests that the character will walk a certain path, but the ending is not quite as expected. Judy Davis, despite the hard work, has a terrible and extremely unpleasant character, so the actress's effort is not fruitful.

It is in the more technical details that Lean shows his worth, for the rich and elegant cinematography, magnificently colored, which is complemented by the excellent sets, costumes and the careful choice of filming locations, which emphasize the exotic and mysterious side of India. The crowded market scenes, or those erotic ruins, are clear examples of what I mean. We just missed the smells! The worst is even Maurice Jarre's soundtrack. It's perfectly inappropriate and gives the film an unpleasant comedic environment.",4.0
15927,"Sir David Lean has produced a spectacular piece of cinema in this lengthy adaptation of the E.M. Forster tale of the Raj. ""Mrs. Moore"" (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) is travelling to visit her son in India, accompanied by Judy Davis ""Adela"". They arrive to discover a society riddled with division and bigotry. After spending time at establishment events, they decide to experience a little of the traditional culture. With the help of ""Aziz"" (a superb Victor Banerjee) - a local doctor, they visit the legendary Marabar caves. There, something untoward happens - ""Adela"" rushes back to the city in a dishevelled state and ""Aziz"" finds himself in jail accused of an heinous crime. To be honest, the story isn't one of Forster's best but Lean has assembled a strong supporting cast including Sir Alec Guinness, James Fox with Nigel Havers and Richard Wilson epitomising the ignorance of the occupying power well. I found that the editing (again, done by Lean) missed the sharpness of someone like Anne V. Coates - a few too many scenic cutaways. That said, the major redeeming feature is the spectacular scale of the film; not just the scenery but the crowds and the score from Maurice Jarre. It isn't anywhere near as visceral as ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" nor the characters as good as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but it is still a stunning film well worth a watch.",7.0

A blonde teen from Gulf Coast Texas named Billie Jean and her little brother, Binx (Helen Slater and Christian Slater), become outlaw fugitives after a mishap. Two other girls go on the lam with them wherein Billie Jean cuts her hair and, unexpectedly, becomes a cultural sensation. Keith Gordon, Peter Coyote and Dean Stockwell have peripheral roles.

Being released in 1985, the movie screams mid-80’s on every front. The soundtrack, for instance, includes cuts like “Invincible” by Pat Benatar and “Rebel Yell” by Billy Idol. The first act is interesting enough but the movie somehow peters out. Helen is winsome as the protagonist, but not curvy enough to hold my interest whereas Christian, who was 15 years-old during shooting, plays his role well, but his character, Binx, is just an annoying loser who seems to always do the wrong thing. If someone just mercifully shot him at the beginning there would be no problem and no film.

While this one should be filed under subpar 80’s teen flicks, it has a few points of interest to make it worthwhile to certain viewers.

16022,"Nine lives, which isn't exactly true. There are definitely more than nine lives in this movie, but you could also choose to think of the title a bit differently. Like, they say a cat has nine lives, meaning that you can try and kill it, but its nearly impossible, it will just keep coming back. It is sorta the same thing with the nine women of this movie. They have all endured hardship in their lives, but they are impossible to kill (not that anyone is trying, except maybe one of the women themselves).

To break down the plot of this movie is not easily done. It is about people, it is about relationship, love, hatred, betrayal and so many other things, but ultimately, it is about life... and death. When the movie was done, it returned to the main screen of the dvd menu, and something caught my eyes. There were two animals in the picture, a white dove flying (a symbol of peace and live), and a black cat, going in the opposite direction of the dove (often a symbol of bad luck, but I guess, also a symbol of resilience). Those, I guess, are the central themes in this movie.

The movie itself is constructed as nine viginettes (small short films really), but where some of the characters are also part of the stories of others. It's not an original idea, but then again, it doesn't have to be, it just needs to be done well. I am not a huge fan of these types of movies, but these stories have enough on their mind to keep you involved. Also, the cast of this movie is great. Solid actors who doesn't steal the picture.

One last thing I'd like to point out, is the technique used in this movie. Every scene is a one long shot. I am not sure what, but this way of filming adds something to the movie, also, the music is not overly dominant in the movie, which is another thing I really appreciate.

16028,"You have probably seen the plot summary a hundred times before, and if you haven't, then you have seen scenes from this film in other films a hundred times before. Julia (Laura Regan) is a master's degree student in psychology. A troubled childhood friend, Billy (Jon Abrahams), contacts her, meets her, rambles incoherently to her, and then shoots himself in front of her. The viewer has already seen Billy, as a young boy, grabbed by monsters in the night, so he probably had some problems even Julia could not help him with. At Billy's funeral, Julia meets Billy's other friends Sam (Ethan Embry) and Terry (Dagmara Dominczyk). The friends have had night terrors as children, and they now bear strange markings on their bodies that seem to say ""hey, mysterious computer generated creatures, come and get me!"" Julia goes to former childhood psychiatrist Dr. Booth (Jay Brazeau), who does the shrink thing. Julia's boyfriend Paul (Marc Blucas) doesn't really get it all, either.

The basic flaw with ""They"" is the lousy execution of the premise. Childhood monsters coming back for adult victims is a good idea, but the script was given the go-ahead without any explanation as to where the creatures come from, why they mark certain victims, etc. This is huge in a film that is otherwise not very compelling. The cast is fine, acting scared at just the right moment. The instrumental score is terrible, it sounds like incidental music for ""The Music Man."" Director Harmon's talents are wasted on the screenplay. He needs a script that will not fail his eye. The screenplay borrows from tons of other films like ""Jacob's Ladder,"" ""Phantasm,"" the remake of ""The Blob,"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" to name a few, and thinks nothing of ripping off the pool scene from ""Cat People."" Sure, the DVD has the alternate ending, which is a ripoff of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" but that ending was better than the one that made the final cut. The special effect monsters are wisely kept out of view through most of the film, they look like giant bats. They do deliver a few scares, but in context with the mindless script, it is not enough.

16072,"***Way better than ""Gettysburg""***

Even though I love the Civil War I waited a full six and a half years before catching the prequel ""Gods and Generals"" (2003). Why? Because 1993's ""Gettysburg"" was so unimpressive. While ""Gettysburg"" has some worthwhile scenes it was merely okay on a whole, and sometimes downright tedious. How the filmmakers made the Civil War's biggest battle boring (generally speaking) is beyond me.

Gods and Generals"" is the prequel detailing the battles of First Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, which are largely viewed through the lens of Stonewall Jackson (Stephan Lang) on the Confederate side and the Chamberlain brothers (Jeff Daniels and C. Thomas Howell) of Maine on the Union side. Also on hand is, of course, Robert E. Lee, played by Robert Duvall, who does a more engaging portrayal than Martin Sheen in ""Gettysburg."" The film starts off slow and builds momentum. By contrast, ""Gettysburg"" started off slower and never became engaging with the exception of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge. 

Where ""Gods and Generals"" really pulled me in was the battle scenes of Fredericksburg and the aftermath. It showed how Civil War troops were required to march, shoot & reload in formation while rifles and friggin’ cannons are blasting their way. The Chamberlain brothers had to sleep on the battlefield that night. Imagine sleeping amongst all those dead bodies and dying, moaning soldiers! This was very well done.

There are quite a few other great scenes, like the Yankee and Reb soldiers meeting in the middle of the river to exchange coffee for tobacco; the execution of three deserters; and the ""perfect battle"" for the Confederates at Chancellorsville where General Lee, with a much smaller force, takes the risk of dividing his army and executing a surprise attack. Unfortunately for the Confederates they won at a huge cost as General Jackson loses his ""right arm"" to friendly fire.

The story ends on a slow, melancholy note.

I was impressed with the battle in the town scene. The town looked so authentic. Watching the documentary afterward I learned how they accomplished this: they filmed it at Harpers Ferry, WV.

Some have complained that the Southern viewpoint is shown in a more positive light than the Northern, but I disagree. While it seems more time is spent with Jackson & Lee's story, considerable time is certainly given to the North as well; the film does an excellent job of taking the middle road between the two positions.

The film was shot on location in Virginia, Maryland and Harpers Ferry, WV and runs 3 hours and 39 minutes. The Director's Cut (which I haven't seen) runs a full hour longer and features the bloody battle of Antietam and a subplot with John Wilkes Booth.

FINAL WORD: If you thought ""Gettysburg"" was boring don't let that prevent you from checking out ""Gods and Generals."" Yes, you have to be ready for a long movie and it does have some slow, dramatic parts but it builds momentum and it's one of best Civil War films in helping the viewer visualize the battles and many other aspects.

WARNING: Believe it or not, the film shows overt depictions of Bible reading, citation and prayer!! It also dares to show Christianity and marriage (between a man and woman) in a positive light!! Oh my God!!!

Piper Perabo plays his girlfriend, William Fichtner his friend at work and Shea Whigham a former best bud from childhood.

""First Snow"" (2006) is a gritty, desolate exploration of freewill and fate, not to mention the struggle with guilt, paranoia and doing the right thing. It has the bleak, reverent tone of movies like “The Woodsman” (2004), “The Mothman Prophecies” (2002),” “Dark Country” (2009), “The Dry Land” (2010), “Leo” (2002) and “The Cry of the Owl” (2009). Don’t expect any overt supernaturalism, but there are hints of mysterious forces beyond human decision or activity.

Pearce is very reminiscent of Brad Pitt in this particular role while Perabo is always a pleasure. Yet the film isn’t pleasurable in any conventional sense. It’s grey and film noir-ish with a sense of desperate inevitability. You have to be in the mood for slow-burn mundaneness to appreciate it.

It was interesting to see a young Jodie Foster...

While I appreciate this popularizing (I'm still not convinced it birthed) a trope of ""body swapping"", it seems very uninspired: as if they said, ""Wouldn't it be great if a kid and a parent swapped?"" and then just stopped coming up with ideas.  It was honestly very jarring on both swaps, the latter being honestly confusing (despite having addressed it directly).

The movie made me realize how difficult it would be to swap places and attempt to ""be"" that person without a shred of preparation.  I'm sure that's a bad sign as I should be more entertained by the novelty or adversity of the situation, but no.

It's not that its a bad movie, there's a lot going on, a lot of it decent, but it's very dated.  Even the action in it is a little awkward, but I certainly see why people in 1976 would have been impressed with this.

On the other hand, I don't imagine people were talking about it for very long.  There is a lot of thought narration that occurs, which isn't very engaging, and most of the engaging humor is cheap physical humor of ""what's going to go wrong this time"" so you're not engaged very long and the impression doesn't hold.

The part of the movie that is actually rather good is the substance of teaching everyone to appreciate everyone else in the family, but we really took ""walk a mile in his shoes"" to an extreme here.  There are more palatable ways to express the concept, and more movies that use this trope.

They only give you a snippet of Ellen (Harris) and Annabel (Foster) in their actual state, before switching it up, but it's more than enough to set up how the characters should act versus how they then act.

Carnival Of Souls has thankfully found a whole new audience in the new millennium, the advent of cheap triple pack DVDs and a lush Criterion release have brought it firmly to the attention of Horror/Ghost fans who were not aware that the film even existed. That said, there is no doubting that many big name directors were fully aware of it, tho, for Carnival Of Souls has influenced such luminary genre masters from Romero to Carpenter, and from Hooper to Shyamalan, be it the low budget DIY ethic, or its now genre staple twist ending, it's a film (along with it's director Herk Harvey) that is referenced as much as it is copied.

The tag often used for the film is that it's an elongated Twilight Zone episode, and sure enough I think that is a perfect fit. Its whole structure feels like a part of that wonderful and amazing Rod Serling show, and for sure this story owes a doff of the cap to An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge (an Ambrose Bierce short that was reworked and used on Serling's show), but to merely suggest a retread of a previously used idea would be very unfair. Carnival Of Souls is full of eerie sequences that are dream like in quality yet goose pimply in effect. Scored at frequent intervals by a jangling organ shrill, the ghostly phantoms that plague poor Mary actually bring a shiver to the spine; while a surrealistic dance of the carnival is a stunning eerie highlight. It's a wonderfully brought together story that has one pondering uneasily from the get go, managing to jolt your senses adroitly with a very special ending.

Besides the haunting ambiance, what I like best about it is the portrayal of two intersecting dimensions: Someone in the spiritual dimension can't be seen or (for the most part) heard in the physical realm. While it's overrated and predictable, it's still an interesting ghostly period piece.

The movie runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, and was shot in Lawrence, Kansas, and Magna, Great Salt Lake & Salt Lake City, Utah.

It's during the extensive search process (a man with a bit of string with a weight tied to it) that ""Mary"" (Candice Hilligoss) emerges from the river, the sole survivor. Gradually, though, things start to become ambiguous - she is obsessed with a run down carnival nearby, is soon seeing apparitions and after a short while we all start to wonder if she is actually real or not! The acting from Hilligoss and from Art Ellison as the savvy preacher is quite compelling to watch (the dialogue much less so) and as the plot thickens, the drama builds nicely into quite a tense little horror story with an effective organ-based score to help raise the tension too. Watch it on a dark, wintery, night and it is a remarkably effective B-feature.",7.0
16093,"**Even bad movies deserve to have a place in history.**

After seeing this movie, I'm left with the feeling that it's a bit overrated, even though it's undoubtedly a remarkable classic of psychological horror. It's more rudimentary than one would expect, and the lack of means and resources is evident. On a very tight budget, director Herk Harvey deserves praise for the way he made the most of what he had and made an authentic labor of love. After reading a little, I realized that this was the only feature film of him and actress Candace Hilligoss. Their careers took an unhappy course towards obscurity, largely because of the critical and box office failure of this film which, only years later, and at the expense of TV and VHS, would become worthy of some notoriety.

The film begins with a clash between two cars where one of them, with three girls, falls into a river. After three hours of searching, Mary Henry, one of the occupants of this car, appears miraculously alive. She is a musical performer and, after a while, moves to Salt Lake City to work as an organist in a small church. However, she is a person without faith, for whom it is just a job. Shortly after arriving, she begins to have frightening visions and trances involving a man and an abandoned building, on the shores of Salt Lake, where an amusement park once existed.

The film is happy at building a mysterious and intriguing environment, but it never crosses the border into genuine horror. The sound and an organ soundtrack contribute enormously to this atmosphere (the organ, a very erudite instrument, gradually became umbilically linked to horror). The cinematography is raw and disagreeable, and the most interesting set is the Saltair Pavilion, which still exists, very modified and different from what it was in this film. The film cleverly uses local extras and actors to save money. However, the amateurism, the bad dialogues, the poverty of the script and the lack of a capable director completely compromise the effort of the cast. Even Candace Hilligoss looks bad. As we watch the film, we understand well the reasons that dictated its failure. As a film, it's a mediocre job, it's not even disturbing. So why on earth has it become so prestigious nowadays?

I believe that the key to understanding this lies in the “cult” phenomenon itself. The essence of this cultural movement lies in the search and recapturing of original material, somewhat forgotten or poorly appreciated in its time. And this film, as it turns out, is precisely within the genre of stuff sought after by “cult” followers. It is because of their action that this film won over its audience after a long time.",4.0

Queen Latifah is another good addition but her character stops making sense when the Pajama party comes into the mix, she spends the first half talking about empowering black women just to in the end of it thinking that undressing black women for a party for the enjoyment of the males sounding like a good idea. And the whole aspect of the pajama party felt a bit forced, like they threw that in at last moment when they realised they needed a party in the film to sell it as a sequel to House Party.

He is eventually apprehended after robbing a bakery and sent to a reformatory where warden Michael Redgrave spots his abilities as a runner. Determined to help the boy from his path of self-destruction the two begin an uneasy relationship that continues after his release when he must race for his school against a neighbouring private school that has advantage and privilege. It is a superbly paced, considerately directed rite-of-passage story; a young man facing indifference from family and society who lucks out, to some extent, with an authority figure who actually gives a damn. At times bleak, it offers quite an interesting insight into the (lack of) opportunity for many in early sixties Britain.

16113,"Delta Damage!

The Delta Force is directed by Menahem Golam and Golam co-writes the screenplay with James Bruner. It stars Chuck Norris, Lee Marvin, Joey Bishop, Robert Forster, George Kennedy, Robert Vaughn and Shelley Winters. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by David Gurfinkel.

Film is a very loose working of the real life TWA Athens hijacking in 1985, done in a pure fantastical Hollywood style. It would prove to be the final movie of hard man actor Lee Marvin who would sadly pass away a year later, unfortunately this didn't prove to be a fitting swansong for him. All the elements were there, a star name cast fronted by one of the 1980s action movie stars and a hot topic story ripe for serious drama and thrills. Sadly the pic doesn't deliver on its promise of something substantial.

However, if you are an action movie fan who isn't the kind to get in a twist about political correctness, sloganeering and overt flag waving, then there's lots of fun to be had. Stripped back from the political aspects (rah rah rah) it's a Norris cartooner, while Marv gets one final decent pay day. The action is well put together, all bonkers, gloriously so, none more so than when Norris is at the forefront. Be it hand to hand butt kicking or indulging in motor cycle mayhem (rocket launchers, oh my!) , it's excessively joyous.

Yep! There's cheese aplenty, especially once the human drama of the first hour gives way to macho marauding, whilst Silvestri's musical score is irritating and irritatingly catchy - sounds more like it should have been in an 80s Brat Pack movie - and you can't help but be annoyed that pretty much all the big names in the supporting cast are badly wasted! Also sad to see a frail Marvin in this, ravaged by years of nicotine and alcohol this is not how we want to remember him and therefore we are duty bound not to.

16131,"***Haunting and surreal Southern Gothic is nigh post-apocalyptic***

Two boys living with their father (Dermot Mulroney) in rural Georgia near Savannah (where the film was shot) try to eke out a living off the land. Chris (Jamie Bell) is about 16 and Tim around 10; both manifest their grief over their dead mother and the challenges of their destitute isolation in different ways: Chris gets in trouble with the law while Tim strangely seems preoccupied with consuming non-edible items. Their father's brother (Josh Lucas) comes to visit and seems affable enough, but there's a wild, sinister glint in his eyes. No wonder, he's inwardly frothing with hostility and greed.

David Gordon Green's ""Undertow"" (2004) is a bit reminiscent of Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven"" (1978) in that both are realistic dramas focusing on youths in rural areas and both offer a dreamy viewing experience. Each tries hard to enchant with their movie magic. Unlike ""Days,"" however, ""Undertow"" is rooted in Southern Gothic. Of the two, I favor ""Undertow.""

After viewing the director’s awesome ""Snow Angels"" (2007), easily one of the greatest dramas ever filmed, I decided to give this one, his previous film, another chance. I'm glad I did because ""Undertow"" is the type of movie that improves on repeat viewings.

But these types of arty flicks aren't for everyone. Those bred on modern blockbusters will likely find ""Undertow"" dull, meandering and pointless. I myself wasn't all that impressed the first time I watched it. I didn't hate it; I just didn't ""get"" it. I'm glad I gave it a second (and third) chance, however, because ""Undertow"" succeeded in pulling me in under its spell. You just have to be in the right mode for a film of this ilk.

The ""dreamy"" quality noted above is facilitated by Philip Glass' mesmerizing score that plays during the opening and closing credits. It's simple and repetitive, but spellbinding. I've gone to the credits a few times just to enjoy this brilliant piece.

Being a Southern Gothic drama/thriller, ""Undertow"" has a cool Southern ambiance with focus on the rural underbelly. Other films that are successful in this regard come to mind: ""The General's Daughter,"" ""Ode to Billy Joe,"" ""I Walk the Line"" (with Gregory Peck, 1970), ""Mississippi Burning,"" ""Squirm,"" ""The Man in the Moon"" and ""The Skeleton Key."" If you have a taste for these types of films, including the aforementioned ""Days of Heaven,"" you'll likely appreciate ""Undertow."" The difference with “Undertow” is that it concentrates so exclusively on pastoral paucity that it cops a poetic post-apocalyptic ambiance.

16154,"_**Haunting mystery/horror on coastal Connecticut**_

Released in 1971, ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" chronicles events after the title character (Zohra Lampert) gets out of a mental institution and moves into an old house on coastal Connecticut with her husband (Barton Heyman) and a friend (Kevin O'Connor). There they discover a hippie-like squatter named Emily (Mariclare Costello) whom they eventually invite to stay because they all get along. Jessica starts to hear voices as they catch wind of rumors of a drowning victim from 90 years earlier who's now a ghost or maybe even a vampire. Are the increasingly crazy happenings real or all in Jessica's mind?

This is a realistic mystery/horror movie in the mold of 1967's ""The Shuttered Room"" and 1962's ""Carnival of Souls."" I mean 'realistic' in the sense that the tone is believable. It's a low-key, haunting slow-burner, so if you want over-the-top, cartoony horror, look elsewhere.

Zohra Lampert is effective as the mentally unstable protagonist. The way the movie constantly looks into her thought-life and the uncertainties thereof is reminiscent of 1968's ""Rachel, Rachel."" The theme is the hypnotic power of a woman. Reflect on Jessica's situation at the end. If she dares to speak out, who would believe her story?

The drowning victim from the 19th century was named Abigail. I bet this was where KD got the name for his notable 1987 horror-metal concept album.

A mob hit-man (Mickey Rourke) teams-up with a young psycho (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and they go after a separated couple (Diane Lane & Thomas Jane) who witnessed a botched hit. Rosario Dawson is on hand as the twerp's girlfriend.

""Killshot"" (2008) is a thriller/drama by John Madden that supposedly had post-production problems, sat on a shelf, was reedited and whatever else. As such, some criticize that it doesn't flow well. Don't believe it. This is a very professionally-made film and I never got the sense that the story didn't flow, regardless of what they edited out, reedited or what have you. The story's easy to follow and makes sense.

Mickey Rourke is always a highlight even though he essentially plays the same character, which I guess most actors do. His character here is the same likable, brooding one seen in ""The Wrestler"" (2008) and ""Passion Play"" (2010) with the variation that he murders people for a living. Yes, that's a big difference and it does cause the viewer to disapprove of him but it's hard to hate him, unlike his two-bit partner. Somewhat likable or not, the Rourke character HAS to pay for his misdeeds (or should pay, at least).

Speaking of the twerp partner, Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines here as a scumbag with almost zero redeeming qualities. Something happens to him at the end and you just can't help saying ""THANK YOU.""

Thomas Jane is always a solid masculine protagonist as is Lane in the feminine department. The film is just as much about the potential reestablishment of their relationship as it is about the thugs trying to find them. But this is definitely a thriller/drama. You get a lot of quality drama interrupted by sudden and intense thrills.

The score's nice and atmospheric and there's a great song on the soundtrack (""Monkey"" by Low).

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Port Perry, Uxbridge and Toronto, Canada, as well as Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Detroit.

16167,"**_The wages of sin is..._**

**Death.**

That blurb makes perfect sense once you see the film.

""From Within"" (2008) tells the story of a Maryland town plagued by a series of apparent suicides. Those from the town's prominent church attribute the problem to witchcraft and zero-in on the Wiccan son of a witch who literally burned to death several years earlier (written off as an accident). A Christian girl, Lindsay, takes compassion on the Wiccan dude, Aiden, and tries to understand him and what's really going on. Meanwhile people keep dying. Is this somehow retribution by the Wiccans? A small group of the Christians pull out the guns, led by Dylan, the pastor's son and Lindsay's boyfriend.

If you're interested in seeing a typical slasher flick, ""From Within"" probably won't appeal to you, but if you're in the mood for a serious chiller with an original concept and thought-provoking material this is the film to see, particularly if you're interested in belief systems, psychology, spirituality and questions of morality.

Some might criticize the film as anti-Christian but this is a superficial and knee-jerk reaction. The story's main protagonist, Lindsay, is shown in a completely positive light and most of the other Christians reveal positive and negative qualities. Is this anti-Christian or simply the way it is? Besides, the film clearly shows the negative sides of the Wiccans as well.

The picture acknowledges the human need for belief systems to get through life and that people are still people regardless of what they believe. It doesn't tell the viewer what belief system to adhere to (or which one is 'right') but it does unveil the existence of dark spiritual power and the dangers of sin, so what's that tell ya? 

Some rightly point out that the influential mega-church in the film shows aspects of numerous Christian sects, which isn't realistic. I believe this was done intentionally by the writer (Brad Keene) so that the film's not picking on just one group. Hence, the mega-church is a microcosm of Christendom and represents all forms of Christianity. Such an approach yields a group that is not fully believable even while having many aspects of truth. Needless to say, don't look to this film for a accurate depiction of legitimate Christianity. It's a movie, not real life.

The way the death-curse works is interesting: The curse is spread socially via the first person exposed to the latest victim; in other words, it's contagious. Also, the victims die via an evil doppelganger (an obvious type of the flesh or sin nature) who kills them in a way that looks like suicide. This supports the idea that evil can only slay or ruin or limit a person through his/her own volition, i.e. 'from within'. You could put it this way: The way of darkness is the way of self-destruction.

I liked how the film shows members of both belief systems humbly admitting they made mistakes and willing to make things right, whatever the cost.

The story shows the domino effect of human failing. One person's moral failure leads to a deadly cover-up & slander which brings about retribution and numerous innocents' deaths. On and on and on. Evil begats evil.

As noted above, the film is thought-provoking. Lindsay sees her church's error and hypocrisy even while she experiences its positive aspects. She reaches out in compassion to the Wiccan dude, a purely loving gesture, but suspects that witchcraft is what released the death-curse. She's stuck between evil & error on both sides, what can she do? 

""From Within"" is a horror film in the truest sense. Although it reveals a lot of truth about the human condition, both good and bad, it's not ultimately life-affirming. This is horror.

One of the film's highlights is the song played during the opening credits ""This Voice"" by Ane Brun. It's from her 2006 album A TEMPORARY DIVE. You can hear the whole song on Youtube.

""From Within"" is amazing. It's original, absorbing, fascinating and provocative; a horror masterpiece.

It runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot in Havre de Grace & Perryville, Maryland (it's nice to see a movie shot somewhere other than friggin' Vancouver & British Columbia).

16174,"***Uneven Hallmark fantasy notable as Bridget Fonda’s last film***

In the late 1800s the daughter (Chelsea Hobbs) of a hotel owner in a town in the Great Northwest becomes enamored with the bellboy, Kai (Jeremy Guilbaut). When an icy-but-beautiful woman known as the Snow Queen (Bridget Fonda) whisks him away, Gerda (Hobbs) seeks to find him & free him after she amazingly enters the parallel realm of the Snow Queen. But, first, she has to struggle through Spring, Summer and Autumn and the challenges thereof.

""Snow Queen"" (2002) is a Hallmark production that runs 12 minutes shy of 3 hours and was based on the original fairy tale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, which was first published in two parts in 1844-1845. Elements from another folktale about the four seasons were mixed into the brew.

This is an Americanized version of the fairy tale with the events taking place somewhere out West in the USA or Canada, both of which are (North) America. The film was shot in British Columbia and takes place there or anywhere in the Great Northwest in the late 1800s (or early 1900s). It definitely doesn’t take place in Denmark since (1) there are snowcapped mountains in the background and (2) everyone speaks English. I suppose someone could argue that it takes place in either Norway or Sweden, but that doesn't resolve the English-speaking issue (unless you simply imagine the characters speaking a Scandinavian language).

The long movie’s worth catching just to see Bridget in her last role before marrying notable composer Danny Elfman and starting a family. Hobbs doesn’t personally trip my trigger, but she’s a’right. Guilbaut is bland, but serviceable. The movie comes alive whenever Fonda is present.

Most of the first half is rooted in reality and is quite good for a TV production, but the mid-section focuses on Gerda’s misadventures journeying through Spring, Summer and Autumn while Kai is captive in the Snow Queen’s stronghold on top of a mountain guarded by a talking polar bear. The entire middle of the picture cuts back-and-forth between these two stories with a few sequences in reality thrown in for good measure, the latter involving the father at the hotel (Robert Wisden) and his cook, Minna (Wanda Cannon).

In Gerda’s quest the characters come-and-go like a rollercoaster ride. It’s reminiscent of the Neverland sequences in “Hook” (1991). If you like fairy tales like “Snow White and the Huntsman” (2012) or episodic fantasies like “The Odyssey” (1997), “Ulysses” (1954) and “The Lords of the Rings” trilogy (2001-2003) give this a look; just remember it was made on a TV budget and there’s not a lot of swashbuckling, as with those other productions.

The film runs 2 hour, 48 minutes and was shot entirely in British Columbia (Cranbrook, Fort Steele & Vancouver).

John, Tom, Matt and Bud, these are the Elder boys, who upon meeting up at the funeral of their recently deceased mother, find that their father may have been murdered over a card game. The boys must cast off sibling rivalries and find out just what has been happening in their childhood town of Clearwater, Texas.

Unfairly given harsh treatment upon its release by the critics and beset with behind the scenes problems, The Sons Of Katie Elder actually holds up rather well in this day and age. All the required traits are in the film to make it an oater of some worth, a splendid cast with as much macho beef as you can shake a stick at, a top Elmer Bernstein score, the wonderful use of the Casa Blanca location and a revenge driven plot of some note. So why is it hard to actually sell this picture to the staunch Western crowd? Well coming as it did in 1965 it certainly has something of a modern sheen to it, an uneasy bed fellow with the wild west theme of the picture. The casting of the brothers just about works, but Michael Anderson Jr (Bud) and Earl Holliman (Matt) do seem to be overawed by the presence of John Wayne (John) and Dean Martin (Tom), meaning as a foursome it never quite gets to being a tight acting unit. The length of the picture may also be an issue to some? Long periods of inaction work to me personally because the characters (family unit) are gaining much needed depth, but for those wanting guns a toting at frequent intervals are not exactly catered for.

Yet what action there is surely more than makes it worth the viewers patience? From the Duke swinging a nice piece of hickory to a wonderful riverside shootout, Henry Hathaway's Western is not found wanting for memorable sequences, in fact if you ask me then the mere sight of the Duke blasting away with a six shooter in each hand is a truly blood pumping joy, and don't get me started on a delightful Dean Martin scene as he raffles his glass eye!

16227,"Dark Passage, light journey.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Vincent Parry has been imprisoned in San Quentin for murdering his wife, he escapes at sets about clearing his name. After being picked up, and then hidden by Irene Jansen (who has followed his case closely), Parry gets a tip from a cab driver which leads him to an underground plastic surgeon. After being given a new face, Parry must keep away from the police and find out just who did in fact kill his wife?

OK, so the plot isn't much to write home about, but the star appeal of the leads and a quite simply brilliant supporting performance lifts this noirish thriller way above average. Humphrey Bogart is Vincent Parry and Lauren Bacall is Irene Jansen, so it's with a tinge of sadness that Dark Passage is considered the weakest film of the four collaborations from the special duo. And though in plot and screenplay that may well be true, I maintain that the sexual chemistry here is as electric as it is in The Big Sleep. Has to be said, though, that both Bacall & Bogart are playing second fiddle to a waspish turn from Agnes Moorehead as Madge Rapf, she ups the ante and grabs the attention span when the film drifts close to a stand still.

The clever camera technique of viewing the events from Vincent's eyes works well for the first third of the film (we never see Vincent's face), but heavy with Bogarts' narration, this loses impact once Vincent gets his new face. The mysterious element to the plot doesn't quite get the jolt that it should because sadly we know it's Bogart from the off, So when the reveal comes about it just falls a little flat. Still, the film works as a more than serviceable thriller, with great acting and a very tidy turn of events in the ending make Dark Passage recommended viewing for noirish thriller fans. 7/10",7.0
16227,"Humphrey Bogart spends at least half of Dark Passage heard but not seen. When the movie isn’t shot from his point of view – little more than a gimmick in any day and age, though I guess in 1947 it might have had the benefit of novelty; sort of like a first-person shooter long before first-person shooters –, Bogie’s face is either a shadowy silhouette or wrapped in bandages. The latter is the result of a back-alley plastic surgery, which is itself an oddity since this is an extreme that more often than not only true villains will go to – perhaps because only a truly guilty conscience could bear to part with the face in the mirror.

In this case, however, Vincent Parry (Bogart) is a the victim of a Miscarriage of Justice who sets out to Clear My Name. What happens if he does manage to prove his innocence? Will he then undergo further cosmetic surgery and go back to looking like whatever it was he looked like before? Or will he just go through the rest of his life with a surgically rearranged visage? Something tells me ol’ Vince did not think this through; on the other hand, he could have done a lot worse – like, for instance, Peter Lorre in The Face Behind the Mask.

Of course, for all the good his new face does him, he might as well have kept the old one and saved himself the money and the time – and one could say the same of writer/director Delmer Daves; I mean, what’s the point of getting Bogie (who had by then starred in, among others, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, To Have and Have Not, and The Big Sleep) only to have us play peek-a-boo with him for the first half of the film?",2.0

What ensues involves Oliver travelling to South America where he must thwart this deadly plan. Neither actor are at the top of their game, indeed for many of Olivier's scenes I half expected Neil Diamond to emerge singing ""Love on the Rocks"" (even if we are 18 months too early).

James Mason has a bit part as the Nazi henchman ""Siebert"", and Lilli Palmer is quite good as Olivier's daughter (""Esther"") and they add a little depth to this over-long, but decently paced mystery.

16250,"> 1. The story of Marty: The beginning of the Love saga.

This was the Hallmark's production, a television movie series called Love saga. This is the first one in the 11 episodes, a long movie series. The first 8 are based on the books by Janette Oke and remaining 3 are not. Each chapter in the each film that briefs different stages of lives in the different timeline and characters. Its the dramatised romance stories in the times of the cowboy culture in the United States, but in the realistic approach. So in the next few days and/or weeks, my reviews are going to be sequels and prequels to this one.

I haven't done this like since five years, after the 'Ernest' movies. I watched them one after another for weeks, that was a quite an experience apart from my likes and dislikes parts from that series. Watching all together in a short period of gap is better and gives an opportunity to follow the series easily than watching them one per year on the television. It is going to be a simple and short review, that's what I'm thinking to give. Okay then lets jump into the 'ocean of love' for a long swim.

As I said the first film in the eleven. Kicks off quite quickly with a tragic in the beginning. All about the present narrative, it does not let you know any past events except the characters talks about it in required parts which somehow allows the viewers to get it. I bet in the follow-ups we are going to know more about those, so I did not bother about the character developments in this pilot episode. Engaging story, but very-very simple and too short. A perfect television movie with some great acts and with the well blended background scores.

> ""You know... Sometimes love isn't fireworks.
> Sometimes love just comes softly.""

The story is set in the middle of the 1800s. A young woman begins to narrate her story in the background. A journey of her life in a wagon wheel with her husband. All they have dreamt together is about to happen, but unexpectedly it all shatters like a tree struck by a lightning. Leaves misery behind to carry with clueless about what's coming up. It is about the time to face the Nature's challenge, so the decision must be made quickly to avoid the threat. All these happen within the first ten minutes, the actual story constructive unfolds in the following hour. That lets you know the meaning of the title.

Having Katherine Heigl on-board was the advantage for the movie to grab the attention of the television audience. In fact, it was one of her earlier movies in the career before she was getting very famous. I was interesting only after seeing her name in the cast. But everyone performed well in their roles. The whole story was told in the span of one rotation of the yearly season. As the seasons change how the characters as well refines and finds the life's pleasure from the new beginning.

There might be no large cast, but within its well managed to tell a beautiful tale that covers theme like faith, hope, dream and love. This kind of story suits for the reading, and might look short for a movie, but surprisingly a better movie than I anticipated. There's no second thought, it was a fine adaptation. I enjoyed it and I can't wait for the rest of the installments.

Chris Carmack is a decent lead, while the rest of those onscreen are inoffensive. I can see why these get the hate that they do, especially given how far adrift they are of the very good original with Ashton Kutcher, but these flicks truthfully don't do anything negative to me.",6.0
16261,"_**Good concept and Ali Landry shines, but a little too much sleaze**_

A student working in the genetics department of UCLA (James Roday) inadvertently creates a clone of an unavailable student he wanted to date (Ali Landry Monteverde). He & his sidekick (Desmond Askew) program the clone to like guy things, like beer, pizza, football and sex, but things don’t turn out as they imagined. Eugene Levy is on hand as their professor. 	 

“Repli-Kate” (2002) has a good concept, similar to “Weird Science” (1985), but with less innocence. Roday makes for a well-meaning protagonist while Askew is likable as the sex-obsessed sidekick, albeit a tad annoying. Meanwhile no-name Landry shines as the titular Kate, both real person and clone. She’s reminiscent of Nancy Kovack and makes the movie worth checking out. Unfortunately, for me, the flick’s ruined by a little too much sordidness. For instance, there’s a foursome scene that includes a dog. Need I say more?

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot at UCLA & areas nearby.

16263,"**_Fun 80's teen/dance flick_**

A Catholic school girl (Sarah Jessica Parker) hooks up with a cool guy from public school (Lee Montgomery) to enter a TV dance competition in Chicago. Helen Hunt plays her best friend while Holly Gagnier is on hand as her spoiled nemesis. A 13 year-old Shannen Doherty appears as the guy's little sister.

""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" (1985) mixes the 80's teen/school genre with the 80's dance genre in the mold of ""Footloose"" (1984), just not as heavy with the anti-legalism theme. It's a fun, energetic flick like ""Heavenly Bodies"" (1984), but more teen-oriented.

Although those two movies are better, ""Girls"" is a good movie for when you're in the mood for a lighthearted fun 80's flick. Sarah was 19 years-old during shooting and never looked better; same thing with Holly Gagnier (Natalie), except she was 26 at the time. It's interesting to see Doherty when she was so young and innocent. I shouldn't fail to mention Charene Cathleen in a bit part as Patty.

On the masculine front, Montgomery is effective as the ""hip"" male protagonist, coming off as a mid-80's version of the The Fonz. It's a wonder his career never took off. If you like him, be sure to catch him in his final movie, 1988's ""Into the Fire,"" aka ""The Legend of Wolf Lodge,"" where he plays the same type of character as in ""Girls,"" except that it's an adult-oriented tragedy.

Interestingly, the producers didn't use Cyndi Lauper's version of the title song for licensing reasons. Yet the cover version is acceptable.

Bottom line, if you're in the mood for a flick in the mold of ""Heavenly Bodies,"" ""Footloose,"" ""Teenage Dream"" (1986), ""Flashdance"" (1983) and ""Tuff Turf"" (1985) this one fills the bill.

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles & Culver City (the mall), with some exteriors done in Chicago.

16266,"I picked this up thinking it was the /other/ doomsday movie, little did I know it was a Christian propaganda movie, I should have guessed by the way every time Science ‘Fact’ was presented, it was so far from the mark I couldn’t help but shout either ‘Jesus Christ’ or ‘Good God’ at the screen. 
This is one of the worst things (I nearly said movie then) I’ve ever seen, take every hackneyed Christian slogan you can think of, throw in some stolen bits (that seem cool) from Celestine Prophecies, and The Da Vinci Code, really bad dialogue, really poor acting put it all together, and you will still have something so much better than this embarrassment.
The film opens with a couple of archaeologists who are obviously at the top of their game, because when it comes to a new discovery of gold cross they immediately carbon date it (carbon dating gold? They must be good), they soon realise the Mayan prophecy of the end of the word, in fact, has NOTHING at all with the Mayan religion at all, it’s all about Christianity. A few non-Christians who believe in only what they can see, somehow (regardless of all we know about them so far) feel obliged to travel to a temple in the middle of nowhere (a Mayan temple NOT Christian temple remember) all while the planet  is slowing down on its axis because we have come into alignment with the centre of the galaxy (when is something orbiting something else ever NOT in line with it?) to save the world (presumably).
We now have a missionary (who lives with native people in the middle of the rainforest and yet, somehow barely speaks a word of Spanish), casually jog into a town, but no, she isn’t out for a nice jog, she is looking for a doctor because everybody in her village is ill because, as it is later revealed, they eat fish from a warm river, I kid you not.
The lunacy continues until all the good Christians are taken leaving only the sinners to perish horribly when the world ends, except it doesn’t end, a few walls fall over then everything carries on as usual.
The film has some side-splittingly funny dialogue, for example, ""This is scientific proof that there were christians among the Mayans"", and let’s not forget “I’ve programmed the artificial intelligence to work this out”. The acting was so bad I kept expecting Keanu Reeves to pop up. There were people who were atheists their whole lives, but suddenly were able to quote huge tracts of the bible to each other.
Making a low budget film with a message often (but not always) leads to quite a bad movie, but this film should embarrass even the most obsessive hardcore Christians.

16271,"_**When you conquer the bullies, then what?**_

A handful of wannabe toughs reign in terror at a SoCal high school. When a new kid shows up (Derrel Maury) he decides not to take their sheet. You would think this would be a good thing for the other students.

“Massacre at Central High” (1976) is a high school drama/thriller with slight horror bits that has developed a cult following and influenced future flicks, like “Heathers” (1989). It came out at the same time as the similar “Carrie” and pales by comparison, but not just because of the much lower budget.  I enjoyed the first half for the most part, but then it increasingly went off the rails with implausibilities. If the film took a more low-key route it would've worked, but it went over-the-top and became both eye-rolling and uninteresting by the last act.  

Someone argued that I took it too literally since it’s really a political allegory. Okay, it has deeper meaning, so what? (Most movies do). Being allegorical isn't an excuse for lousy writing with glaringly unbelievable bits. As far as the underlying theme goes, I’m not going to give it away because it’s obvious (think “Lord of the Flies” set in a school).

I suggest sticking with better examples of the genre, like “Carrie,” “Christine” (1983), ""Disturbing Behavior"" (1998) and ""The Rage: Carrie 2"" (1999). For a quality micro-budget example, check out the more recent ""Love Everlasting"" (2016).

Still, it has its points of interest, such as the coastal locations in the L.A. area, the bold Jan-Michael Vincent-looking protagonist (Jan, by the way, was considered for the role), and a few lovely females, headed by Kimberly Beck, who went on to appear in the Buck Rogers episode “Cruise Ship to the Stars” (1979) and, more notably, “Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter” (1984). Also on hand are Lani O'Grady
(Jane) and Cheryl “Rainbeaux” Smith (Mary).

Writer/director Rene Daalder was so upset with the unfitting theme song & score that producers strapped his film with that he refused to watch it in its entirety for three decades.

The movie runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles and Malibu with Pomona College standing in for the exterior high school and Villa Cabrini High School in Burbank being used for interiors.

A town by the central California coast is invaded by circus-like extraterrestrials, who prey upon humans for their blood.

""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"" (1988) is a colorful and fun alien invasion flick in the mold of “Critters” from two years earlier but, unlike that flick, is too preposterous to suspend disbelief. For instance, “Critters” offers a good explanation for how one of the extraterrestrials appears like a striking rock star, but you’ll get nothing like that here.

Nevertheless, there are multiple funny moments and winsome redhead Suzanne Snyder is a highlight as Debbie. Also, John Vernon is entertaining as the curmudgeon officer and the sequence involving one of the Klowns using a certain character as a ventriloquist dummy is worth the price of admission.

An interesting interpretation is that the Klowns are analogous of the dispersed Israelites who learned to hide in plain sight and thrive (not just survive) by changing their names and taking control in their new environments thru influencing and manipulating entertainment, politics, the media and financing (e.g. Federal Reserve banking).

Mainland Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) flies off to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a 12 year old girl. What he finds is a culture steeped in Paganism, presided over by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). Meeting static and indifference wherever he goes - and being driven to anger by the assault on his Christian beliefs - Howie is very much a man alone and most likely in grave danger? 

Directed by Robin Hardy and adapted to screen by Anthony Shaffer from David Pinner's novel, Ritual, The Wicker Man is very much a cult masterpiece. The back stories to it could make a film all by itself, be it censor baiting, studio cuts, body doubles or just plain offending religious groups, it's a film that is well worth looking into via the top range home format releases.

From the moment Howie (a truly brilliant Woodward) lands at Summerisle everything seems off, there's a sinister atmosphere pervading the story. He is met by unnerving imagery wherever he goes, songs and rituals gnawing away at his senses, there's even eroticism deftly placed within the film's master plan. He doesn't know what's going on, and neither do we, this is a mystery right? There is after all a missing child to be found, right? But once Lord Summerisle (Lee also terrific) enters proceedings and ups his game, things unravel in edgy fashion, building up to the justifiably famous and harrowing finale.

Was it worth it? Well, I didn't really think so. Policeman ""Howie"" (Edward Woodward) arrives on a remote Scottish island after reports that a girl has gone missing. He is perplexed by the seemingly indifferent attitude of the locals who claim that she never existed or her mother who claims that she is six feet under in the graveyard. He becomes even more bemused by the general attitude of the villagers - led by their laird ""Lord Summerisle"" (Christopher Lee) and taught by their not quite ""Jean Brodie"" schoolteacher ""Miss Rose"" (Diane Cilento) to life in cereal, and to his presence in particular. Soon, his investigation starts to lead him a merry dance as he begins to suspect something way more sinister is afoot - and boy, is he correct. Thing is, though, can he find and save the missing girl and get to the bottom of this mystery. To be fair, it does offer us a more sophisticated, almost mythological, approach to an horror movie loaded with mysticism and pagan ritual. Indeed, I don't know that it fits well into that genre at all - it's more of a psychological thriller populated by a decent cast of household names. The thing for me is the story. I just found it all a bit weak; it takes far, far too long to build up anything like an head of steam and is really rather over-scored with music that is left do too much of the heavy lifting when it comes to generating the sparing senses of peril this film elicits. Perhaps it isn't fair to look upon it critically forty years later, when so many of our sensitivities have been eroded away, but I really couldn't figure out quite what all the fuss was about. It's now a cult film - and maybe that says it all? Worth a watch, but a television leaves nothing missing, I'd say.",6.0
16307,"Here Edward Woodward stars as Sgt. Howie, a Christian Scottish policeman sent to the remote island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. 

The horror of the Wicker Man is not the obvious kind that hits you in the face with a hammer, but quietly creeps up on you. The way the pagan villagers act indifferently or defensively to the supposed disappearance or murder of a child is disturbing, especially as everyone seems to be hiding something, including the girl's classmates.

One criticism of the various heavily cut versions of the film is that not quite enough time is given to that subtle process of building up the suspense and atmosphere of the film. The Director's Cut, however, is a small masterpiece. The central idea of this closed-off pagan community, generally peaceful but indulging in the rare bit of ritual of human sacrifice, is delicious. 

Woodward as Howie is on top acting form, as is the legendary Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle. Economical storytelling ratchets up suspense and mystery. Additionally, the film boasts one of the best and most fitting soundtracks I've ever heard, comprised mostly of in world folk songs rather than generic ""spooky"" music.

The ending of The Wicker Man must go down as one of the most shocking in cinema history. Since the film plays it relatively cool until that point, the payoff is all the more harrowingly believable. 

I also enjoyed the idea that, in terms of what may lie beyond death from the point of view of the characters, both Howie and the islanders get some kind of ""reward"" from the final ritual. The islanders get the reassurance that their crops will thrive in the coming year, while Howie gets his martyr's death and the expectation of a special place in heaven. The film made me think a lot about belief systems; who is to say paganism is less valid than any other system of religion? All religions are sustained by faith and passion rather than reason or evidence.

Thought-provoking, strangely beautiful, and just plain creepy, the restored version of The Wicker Man deserves its cult status. Even if you're not usually a fan of horror, you're likely to take something away from this burnt offering. The word ""classic"" was invented for this brilliant and eccentric film.",10.0
16314,"Let's delve into the rise and fall of the three ninjas franchise. Initially, the original “3 Ninjas” stands out as a remarkable film, even though it may not have received the same critical acclaim as others. It exudes a fun 90s vibe that resonates with many viewers. The characters Rocky, Colt, and Tumtum are engaging, especially in their martial arts pursuits under the guidance of their grandfather, Tanaka. While the film lacks in-depth martial arts training, it still retains a nostalgic charm that endears it to audiences, making it a cult classic worth revisiting.

The sequel, while decent, faced challenges with the recasting of Rocky and Tumtum, disrupting the continuity of the original cast. Despite this, the replacements manage to maintain the film's fun and entertaining essence, although it falls short of its predecessor. The lack of martial arts development persists, but the presence of the grandfather adds continuity to the franchise.

The third installment attempted to reunite the original cast for a nostalgic touch, yet the decision to recast once again puzzled viewers. While incorporating Indian culture and indigenous heroes, the film comes across as cheesy and lacks re-watch value, except for the reunion of the original cast members, notably the grandfather.

The franchise's downfall came with the fourth film, a disastrous attempt featuring Hulk Hogan and a Pamela Anderson look-alike in a money-grabbing amusement park takeover plot. The casting of Tumtum was particularly egregious, leading to a lackluster performance. Rocky and Colt were relegated to side characters, detracting from the essence of the three ninjas. The film's shift towards a villain-centric narrative fighting the FBI was seen as the franchise's lowest point, contributing to its eventual demise and disappearance from the spotlight.",6.0

The horror anthology movie has been a popular source of enjoyment for horror fans for a number of decades. As is pretty much always the case, the quality of each segment of the films varies - and this always will be the case. Case in point Campfire Tales.

Something of a little treat for those inclined, this offers up four main stories and a wraparound device which involves four teenagers telling the tales around a campfire after their car has crashed. In my own anthology experiences, the main stories have tended to improve in quality as each story plays out, Campfire Tales is different, it opens weakly - has two great stories in the middle - and then closes on a damp boring squib. leading into the big - if unsurprising - reveal at films end.

The poster for the film puts Amy Smart and James Marsden up at the front, which is a bum steer given that their screen time is not massive. Their story, ""The Hook"", opens the film and it's poor, devoid of scares and tension, and it obviously gears itself up for a chilling reveal but it ends up more funny (even baffling) than creepy.

""The Honeymoon"" is up next and things significantly improve. Based on one of the most famous of urban legends, this finds a young couple of honeymooners stranded out in the woods when their camper van runs out of petrol. Choices are made, menacing terror begins, which all leads to a genuinely shocking finale.

Next up is ""People Can Lick Too"", which finds a young girl home alone and stalked by a paedophile she met on line. The whole episode has a sinister eeriness to it, with some reveals sending chills down the spine. The ending is heart stopping and blood curdling.

The last segment is ""The Locket"", which is well acted but ultimately more wistful and ethereal than anything scary or unnerving. Though the denouement is sure to appeal to many. Nice musical score here as well. And on to the reveal, straight out of The Twilight Zone and from any number of films of the same ilk.

Coming at it as a complete novice as regards ""Firefly"", the short lived TV show that Serenity is spawned from, I personally have no frame of reference to work from. What I found was a hugely enjoyable sci-fi Western hybrid that deserved a better box office than it got. The cast are all comfortable with each other and very watchable, which isn't surprising since Whedon has transported them all over from ""Firefly"", good move that, while the action quota is high and the black comedy rich.

Where the itches start to appear for newcomers like myself, is that it does feel like an extended TV episode. With a twisty plot that sees Whedon cram much into the 2 hour running time, it demands the utmost attention. Which is fair enough to a degree, but many go (or more pertinently would have gone) into ""Serenity"" for a sci-fi action adventure, not for a tickle of the cranium. If this contributed to the poor show at the box office? I'm not sure. But you have to think this really was only made for the die-hard fans of the show.

Galling really, because the last third is a ripper of a blockbuster. The action sequences are expertly crafted, the story explodes still further and the principal characters really let loose, particularly the excellent Fillion. Biggest plus of all, the finale doesn't cop out by insulting those who have stayed the course chartered by the good ship Serenity and its crew. It's smart genre film making, a very enjoyable film without doubt, but really it's not got mainstream appeal. Which might suit those die-hards in a selfish kind of why, but that also means we are unlikely to get a sequel. And that's a shame because a newbie like me could easily stand some more of this whizz bangery. 7/10",7.0
16320,"At the start, I thought this was a sort of hybrid between ""Quantum Leap"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and that it was just going to be derivate nonsense. It's actually quite a bit better than that as we discover the malevolent ""Operative"" (Chiwitel Ejiofor) is on the trail of a priceless asset. It's not a jewel or a gadget, it's ""River"" (Summer Glau) and as he closes in on their ship ""Serentity"", things are starting to get hot for it's captain ""Mal"" (Nathan Fillion) and the others in this disparate crew. There's plenty of dissent amongst this bunch, not least because nobody actually knows why this unassuming woman is so valuable to their determined pursuer - but can they keep together and focussed long enough to evade capture and maybe even find out? None of the acting here is really worth mentioning, but the dialogue is quite entertaining, the visual effects deliver well and there's loads of high-octane cosmic adventure with choreographed fisticuffs, zapping lasers and an excitingly created denouement that the CGI lads can be proud of. I didn't see any of ""Firefly"" (2002) on which this is based, but as a stand-alone sci-fi adventure it still works well.",7.0
16337,"Es ist schwer zu glauben, dass wirklich Tobe Hooper bei der Fortsetzung von Texas Chainsaw Massacre selbst Regie geführt hat. Wo der erste Ton einen sehr beklemmenden Grundton anschlägt, ist der zweite Teil nun mehr Horrorkomödie als bitterböser Horrorfilm. Dies hat sicherlich damit zu tun, dass zwischen den beiden Filmen 12 Jahre Filmgeschichte liegen und Horrorfilme in den 80er Jahren generell anders daher kamen als es noch 1974 der Fall war, doch irgendwie passt dieser humorvolle Ton nicht zu Leatherface und seiner degenerierten Familie. Irgendwie erwartete man ein heruntergekommenes Haus irgendwo in der Wüste und nicht einen eigenartigen Freizeitpark. Für sich genommen ist The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 allerdings kein schlechter Film. Den Ton den der Film treffen will, trifft er auf den Punkt, es gibt einige Szenen für Splatterfans, die Figur der Stretch ist eine echte Scream Queen und mit Dennis Hopper ist sogar ein Superstar an Board.

16342,"Surprisingly good, low budget gem.

You've probably seen the scenario before, kids go feral for some reason and the grown-ups have to survive. What makes this version good is the realistic character reactions. I read other reviews saying at the first sign of danger you would stop looking for your kids and just run. I call BS, or maybe I call someone who has never had kids. A halfway decent parent would not ditch their kids and run away! I would sacrifice my life and the life of anyone around me to save my kids! In a heartbeat. So suggesting that it would be more realistic for a parent to instantly believe a moody teenager that their children are now monsters, with no proof, is just crazy talk. 

The tight plot very cleverly splits up the cast and only lets one character see what is really going on, creating doubt and misinformation, so no-one believes the poor teenager until it is too late, for most of the cast at least.

The tension builds consistently, and doesn't let up. There's enough gore and suspense to please more mature horror fans, but you have to go in expecting a slow build up. Also something weird was going on with the sound, I've read other reviews mention the same, so it wasn't just my copy.

An American couple in Thailand discover possible evidence that their young son who died in a tsunami six months earlier is still alive and living in the jungles of Myanmar (Burma). They pay some dubious characters a lot of money to go up river into the forbidden country. Things go from bad to worse.

Many viewers denounce ""Vinyan"" (2008) because it's not a typical horror film, but that's precisely why it's worthwhile. It's original. It's equal parts haunting, beautiful, strange and creepy. The plot is thin, yet the story maintains your attention.

The acting is excellent all around and you buy these people as real. The five main characters being: Paul and Jeane Bellmer (Rufus Sewell and Emmanuelle Béart), a human trafficker named Thaksin Gao, the captain of the small boat named Sonchaï and the couple's liaison, Kim (Julie Dreyfus).

Memorable parts abound, such as Kim's subtle-but-clear seduction of Paul, the beautiful floating-lanterns at the beach ceremony and the awesome tree fortress.

The meaning of the film is ambiguous, but it provokes thought on several things: The nature of grief (letting go or not letting go), obsession, madness, tribal instincts, going feral and more.

As for the tribe of lost kids in the last act, are they 'vinyan' -- angry, confused spirits who suffered horrible deaths -- or are they simply a pack of kids gone wild in the jungle à la ""Lord of the Flies""? I say the evidence points to the latter.

In any case, ""Vinyan"" has elements of films like ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The Emerald Forest,"" ""Fitzcaraldo"" (or ""Aguirre"") and the aforementioned ""Lord of the Flies.""

The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Thailand.

16372,"The Innocents (1961)

 

Oh willow I die, oh willow I die... 

 

Based on Henry James' novel, The Turn Of The Screw, The Innocents is a thoroughly absorbing chiller that pot boils with almost unbearably knowing glee as to what it's doing to the viewer. Deborah Kerr stars as Miss Giddens, the lady hired by Michael Redgrave to act as governess to his young niece and nephew. We find ourselves in Victorian England, out on some country estate at Bly Mansion, where the children are angelic and enchanting in equal measure. Yet there’s an eeriness hanging over this place and it starts to seemingly play tricks on Miss Giddens' mind, she thinks she sees and hears things. It's only when she talks to housekeeper Mrs Grose (Megs Jenkins), that she starts to piece things together, but worryingly it's the children that appear to be at the root of the problems. Aren’t they?

 

Kerr is fabulous here, carrying an elegant gait around with her, she does a fine line in borderline hysteria caused by something unknown bubbling away under the surface. Filmed on location at Sheffield Park and Gardens, and the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex, this lovely Gothic chiller does justice to its literate source. Being co-scripted by Truman Capote, William Archibald and John Mortimer, that's really not much of a surprise in truth though is it?! Choosing to play on the viewers imagination more than pandering to shocks, director Jack Clayton superbly creates a sort of itchy like sense of dread. He’s fully aware that here in and around the Gothic abode, it’s more often than not what you don’t see – or think you see - that is more frightening.

 

Ace cinematographer Freddie Francis does a marvellous job with the photography, with deep focus and shadows the order of the day, and with Clayton sharp cutting and dallying with angles; and Georges Auric’s sinister music floating around the estate like some spectral peeping tom, the atmosphere created is akin to claustrophobic foreboding. In many ways it's actually an uncomfortable watch, but for all the right reasons, the themes that rumble away are grim in texture, the question of malevolent evil or otherwise is a constant, and fittingly the finale offers up a shocking denouement that is nigh on impossible to shake off. With great performances from the child actors (Pamela Franklin/Martin Stephens) sealing the deal, The Innocents is one of the smartest and most effective chillers to ever have come out of Britain. 9/10",9.5
16372,"_**Low-key Gothic horror with Deborah Kerr**_

A new governess (Deborah Kerr) takes over as nanny of two orphaned siblings at a remote English manor at the turn of the century, but there’s a secretive past to the situation and seemingly ghostly happenings. Pamela Franklin plays the girl.  

""The Innocents” (1961) is a cinematic version of Henry James 1898 novella “The Turn of the Screw,” shot in B&W. It’s technically well-made and has Gothic mood, but the story is intrinsically one-dimensional, resting on the shoulders of Kerr and essentially only involving three other actors. 

Like the original tale, there’s ambiguity: Is the governess hallucinating or is she really seeing what she claims? One thing that lends credence to the latter view is the fact that she is able to describe one of the persons she sees before even knowing he existed.

If you like this movie, check out the unofficial prequel with Marlon Brando and Stephanie Beacham, “The Nightcomers” (1971). While it lacks the ghostly elements, it imaginatively sets the stage for this movie (and James’ original story) in an edgy way à la ""Last Summer"" (1969) and ""The Sailor who Fell from Grace with the Sea"" (1976).

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot at Sheffield Park Garden, Dane Mill, Uckfield, East Sussex, England, and Shepperton Studios southwest of London, plus points nearby.

16373,"That's not because there are more ghosts here than other places, mind you. It's just that people who live here about are strangely aware of them.  

The Uninvited is directed by Lewis Allen and adapted to screenplay by Frank Partos and Dodie Smith from the novel Uneasy Freehold written by Dorothy Macardle. It stars Ray Milland, Gail Russell, Ruth Hussey, Donald Crisp and Cornelia Otis Skinner. Music is by Victor Young and cinematography by Charles B. Lang.

""They call them the haunted shores, these stretches of Devonshire and Cornwall and Ireland which rear up against the westward ocean. Mists gather here... and sea fog... and eerie stories...""

Wonderful old fashioned ghost story that neatly blends romance and a light comedic tone into the pot, The Uninvited is very much a movie of significance. It marks a point in cinematic time when the ghost story proved it could be played for true unnerving impact. It remains a sub-genre of horror that is sorely lacking in bona fide classics, spookers that have longevity, the ability to raise the goose flesh no matter how many times they are revisited. With a new special edition DVD recently released, and the likes of Martin Scorsese and Guillermo del Toro championing its cause by putting it on their lists of favourite frighteners, The Uninvited is proving its worth as an old sub-genre classic.

Plot is pretty conventional stuff. It's 1937 and Milland and Hussey play a brother and sister who fall in love with a cliff side house they stumble upon whilst holidaying on the southwest coast of England. Sure enough they snag themselves the house at a ridiculously cheap price, this even though they are warned of some previous disturbances at the address. Cue a mysteriously locked room that when opened reveals itself to be deathly cold, pets that will not go up the stairs and then comes the hauntings... So far so formulaic, then, but as the story begins to unravel in the second half of the movie, where the light touch is left behind, a fizzer of back story comes to the fore and one or two extra surprises leap out of the narrative. This is not lazy plotting, it is well constructed, the mystery element is strong and sidles up nicely with the spooky goings on.

""If you listen to it long enough, all your senses are sharpened. You come by strange instincts. You get to recognise a peculiar cold that is the first warning. A cold which is no mere matter of degrees Farenheit, but a draining of warmth from the vital centres of the living.""

This is a spooker that, unsurprisingly for the time, is devoid of visceral shocks and blunderbuss like scares. This is more about atmosphere (Lang was Oscar nominated for his noirish photography) and fear of the unknown, where the sound of a sobbing woman in the darkness chills the blood. Perhaps surprisingly for the time? We do get to see spectral images, and they still work and create the desired effect, who needs a computer generated image spitting blood when you can have ethereal spookiness floating eerily above the ground? While we are at it, who needs a beefed up pretty boy actor fighting the good fight against evil when you can have an elegant Ray Milland doing it with a glint in his eye instead? The cast are very effective, with Russell really making a mark so early in her career, while Young's score is both sinister and tender (the song Stella by Starlight would become a popular standard) at all the right times.

A genuine ghost story for those who prefer the sparing atmospheric touch to the noisy carnage approach. 8/10",8.0
16380,"""Suggest we fly to another world""

Whilst I wholeheartedly agree with other amateur reviewers on line that stress you have to put yourself back to 1951 to appreciate the film more, it still doesn't take away from the fact that the film is one of the poorer offerings from the disaster/sci-fi genre of years gone by.

The methodical build up of characters is fine for adding weight to the final reel, the effects are solid for the time, and the ending has an element of heart tugging hope to it, but the film still remains a drawn out laborious watch. 

No amount of shouting about lack of budget and the time frame of its birth can't detract that the film over relies on heavy dialogue to keep the viewer interested. This is all well and good if the pay off is handsome in the extreme, which sadly isn't the case on this occasion. 

I have taken myself back to 1951, and for that reason alone I give it the average rating of 5/10, while I certainly have no hesitation in recommending this to genre fans for at least one watch. It deserves to be looked at, and it deserves respect of course, but that doesn't mean it's particularly above average either.",5.0

My Blue Heaven is fine; there isn't anything terrible, nothing drew me out of the film (except Steve Martin's casting and the choice to use title cards to occasionally change perspective), and I never was confused or disappointed with the story beats, but I was never impressed or fully invested. I picked this movie at random and didn't know what I was watching until the title appeared. I was excited to see that I was going to see a movie with Steve Martin, Rick Moranis, and Joan Cusack, but they are all misused and easily could have been replaced with any other B-list actor.

A group of nuns travel to the Himalayas to set up a school and hospital at the disused Palace of Mopu. Once set up high in the mountains, some of the nuns find themselves seduced by the atmospheric sensuality of the place. Which spells trouble as inner demons start to seep out.

I haven't got much of a review here for you, it really would be redundant due to the widespread availability of detailed works written about the film over the years. Besides which, I can only really agree with 99% of what has been said about the film before. Is there anything new that can be said? I don't think so, really I don't.

Black Narcissus is an experience, a sort of ode to spiritual cinema and a bastion of visual splendour. Some call it a masterpiece, others say it's just shy of being as such, but either way a vast majority of film lovers agree it's film making of considerable skill.

Negatively, however small in the grand scheme of things, it's thin on story and a couple of our lead nun protagonists here are actually too filmy and pretty; I mean I don't intend to insult the thousands of real nuns in the world, but none are surely as foxy as Kerr and Byron as presented here?! You can kind of tell it's the meeting of a visualist and a story teller trying to find a common ground, but the visualist (Powell) holds sway for this one and film lovers the world over are all the better for it.

The story addresses many of the issues of post-colonial India, of poverty, malnourishment, illiteracy and Christianity - amongst those who believe and those who want to - and tests the faith of each of the women in differing, potent, ways. Look out for a super performance from May Hallatt as the slightly demented caretaker they call ""Auntie"" who dishes out brutality and sagely wisdom is equal, haphazard, measure.

“The Beastmaster” (1982) came out during the sword & sorcery glut of the early 80s. It may not be as great as “Conan the Barbarian,” but it’s superior to “The Sword and the Sorcerer,” both released earlier the same year. 

The film has a fitting cast and features a nice mix of horrific, dynamic and cute. The witches and winged creatures fit into the horrific category while Singer presents a dynamic protagonist. He’s 6’2” and lithe with a masculine face despite the (dirt) blond hair. He seems smarter than Schwarzenegger and lacks his cumbersome bulk. Meanwhile this is a great flick for animal lovers and you’ll probably want to go out and buy a ferret or two.

Tanya is stunning as usual, but appears too thin. She’d look better in “Sheena” (1984) and, especially, “A View to a Kill” (1985). Unfortunately, she never advanced to anything greater than these films; but at least we have these to remember her.

Unlike “The Sword and the Sorcerer” and “Conan the Barbarian,” which came out 3-4 months prior, “The Beastmaster” failed to generate similar box office earnings. It only garnered $14 million from its $8 million investment. Nevertheless, it’s an entertaining early 80’s sword & sorcery flick

It all starts with the script, which is so stupid that I confess I got lost in it, and that doesn't usually happen, even when the movies are really bad. The cinematography, of misty tones and unpleasant to the eyes, does not obscure the poorly elaborate sets and costumes worthy of a poor comic. Of course, the main actors appear in far fewer clothes when they have to. After all, certain things always sell a movie, no matter how bad it is. The cast is dominated by Marc Singer and Tanya Roberts. I think they were never good actors, despite her having participated in a film from the 007 saga. Even so, in the midst of a cast of amateurs with very little talent, they look like two movie stars.

16442,"Just like a turkey shoot!  

Alvin York of Tennessee was a simple backwoods farm boy who liked a drink and a scrap, then one day, fuelled by drink and anger in his heart, an event gave him religion and a new found respect for life. However, the advent of World War 1, and his subsequent call to duty, tore his pacifist state of mind apart, torn between a patriotic sense of duty and his religious beliefs, Alvin York of Tennessee was to become the name on everyone's lips in 1918.

Sergeant York is pretty much close to being the perfect template for biography movies. It stands out (as it stands up proud) because the makers have the willingness to tell the tale from the humble beginnings of the central protagonist. They then ease it through to the end without feeling the need to rush there. Some allegations of it being a tad slow for its own good may well be valid, but for those of us who crave ultimate detail and flesh on the bones of main characters, well Sergeant York is a peerless joy. By the time that the critical point in York's life is realised, we the audience care so much because we have been party to his life story. From hard working farm boy to falling in love with Gracie, and onto his World War 1 heroics, Alvin York feels like one of us because of the work that all involved have done here.

Producer Jesse Lasky literally spent years trying to persuade the real life York into letting him film his story, the humble and modest Tennessean kept refusing until finally relenting with some conditions. One was that the proceeds go to charity (truly befitting the man that), two was that a non-smoking actress play his wife Gracie, and another that Gary Cooper play the title role!, well he got his wishes, and what a result it turned out to be. Cooper was initially against taking the job but soon relented after a meeting with York himself. Cooper then requested that Howard Hawks direct, which turned out to be the case - but only after the studio failed to attract Michael Curtiz, Henry Koster and a few other notable directors of the time.

As it turned out this was a perfect subject for Hawks, Alvin York boasting all the human traits in a man that Hawks admired, and with Gary Cooper operating on full tilt the resulting picture is a stirring emotive classic that never falls to gung-ho over bearing theatrics. In fact the critical war sequences here are wonderfully subtle. Backing Hawks up is the excellent Sol Polito, whose photography is precious - have a look at one scene as York sits on a cliff edge with his hound, contemplating his being in the war, it's shot in half silhouette and just gives me tingles on my spine.

Critics of the time were mixed on Sergeant York, and many people felt that the film was over propagandist in its aims?, well time has been kind to the film and personally I find the story, and the technical brilliance on show, to be truly remarkable. 10/10",10.0
16442,"To summarize (which is quite a task, since this is a very detailed, comprehensive, and well-done biopic), Gary Cooper plays one of the greatest and most beloved heroes of the First World War: backwoods sharpshooter, Alvin C. York. Hailing from the Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf, somewhere in the Tennessee hills, he spent his youth drinking, carousing, and causing mischief and mayhem in general. All that changes one stormy night when a lightning bolt strikes his rifle, instead of him, and he turns from his rowdy ways and becomes a fine, upstanding Christian. When America becomes involved in WWI, he requests to be exempted from the draft as a conscientious objector. But his appeal is rejected and into the army he goes. As he serves his country, his eyes are opened to the reasons behind the conflict, and to the fact that it isn’t against God or the Bible to fight against evil. In a heroic act, he saves the lives of several men in his squadron and captures over 100 German prisoners.

There’s so much fascinating trivia behind this film which is so much more than your average war picture. It’s the story of a humble yet remarkable man’s life, and a good reminder that, as Alvin observes, “the Lord sure do move in mysterious ways.”

The real Alvin C. York was approached by producer Jesse Lasky several times, asking for permission to film the story of his life. York finally agreed on three conditions — first, that a share of the profits would go towards a Bible school York was trying to establish; second, that a non-smoking actress would play his wife Gracie; and third, that Gary Cooper play him!

At first, Cooper didn’t even want the role. Even if he did he was under contract to Samuel Goldwyn, who had no intention of releasing him. After York spoke to Cooper personally the latter agreed to take the part. A bargain was struck when Goldwyn agreed to lend out Cooper in exchange for Warner Brothers lending him Bette Davis for his production of The Little Foxes. Thus, everything worked out, everyone was happy, and two excellent films were made because of the exchange.

Not only were two great films made (both of which were nominated for Best Picture), but Gary Cooper won his first Oscar for Best Actor! In his acceptance speech he made the comment, “I’ve been in this business sixteen years and sometimes dreamed I might get one of these things.”

While films of this era were consistently clean and wholesome, and had a definite reverence for God, not as many could be called overtly “Christian.” Sergeant York is one of the few movies that definitely fits this category. The pivotal faith aspect of Alvin York’s story is handled well, mostly due to Cooper’s sensitive and sincere performance. Walter Brennan was an honest, upstanding man in his own life, and plays the local pastor who counsels Alvin. Brennan claimed to be religious in his personal life as well. He brings enthusiasm and warmth to his role, and received his fourth nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, the Oscar went to Donald Crisp for ""How Green Was My Valley.""

The scene in which York’s rifle is struck by lightning, causing his conversion, was an invention of the screenwriters. In reality, the steps leading to York’s conversion were longer and more drawn-out due to the efforts of his wife to help him clean up his act.

Ultimately, Sergeant York is a film that takes its time, with a running length of 2 hours and 14 minutes, but it’s time well spent. The production fares well under the expert direction of the masterful Howard Hawks, who received his only Best Director nomination for it.

It also contains one of the most gorgeous camera shots I’ve ever seen. York stands tall and proud on a rocky outcrop, surveying the Tennessee countryside, with his hound dog by his side. It’s shot in half-silhouette, and the imagery is both haunting and exhilarating.

After this recent Resurrection Sunday, when the focus is especially on faith and looking to a Savior, the following is an appropriate quote from the film with which to end this review.

16444,"Leslie Howard had a hand in just about everything here, and has delivered quite a poignant story of a dedicated and visionary man who might just have a legitimate claim to really have helped stave off the Nazis. He portrays R.J. Mitchell, a man whose vision was as an aircraft designer. We were still using bi-planes at the time and though the engineering of flight was now well established, he was determined to push the boundaries. His bosses at British firm SuperMarine were nervous about the investments - especially when he came up with a plan for the aircraft equivalent of a onesie. He sticks to his guns though, and next thing he, with the help of his accomplished pilot ""Geoffrey Crisp"" (David Niven), is winning the Schneider Trophy and pushing speed records from 200+ mph to 400+ mph. All of this development is coming at a time when the Germans are ignoring the Versailles treaty and rearming. There are plenty of Britons pushing for a similar programme, especially the vocal Lady Lucy Houston (Toni Edgar-Bruce) who donates the not inconsiderable sum of £100,000 so he can work with Rolls-Royce to take it's embryonic ""Merlin"" engine and fit it to a nimble fighter aircraft - the ""Spitfire"". Though it is Howard who takes centre stage, I think it's actually Niven who works the best here as the enthusiastic pilot who manages to motivate his friend whilst helping to manage his increasingly obsessive behaviour alongside wife Diana (Rosamund John).

16456,"Sooner rather than later every franchise ends up, by design or accident, a parody of itself; The Crow: Wicked Prayer never stood a chance of avoiding this fate, but then what movie starring Eddie Furlong, David Boreanaz, Tara Reid, and Danny Trejo would? On the other hand, we have Dennis Hopper as a pimp named El Nino who says things like ""You stole daddy's car keys, but you can't handle the horsepower,"" so it's not a total loss.

We know that the Crow, like the Dude, must face a gang of nihilists; in this case a multi-ethnic gang whose members each identify with one of the Four Horsemen: Luc 'Death' Crash, War (Marcus Chong), Famine (Tito Ortiz), and Pestilence (Yuji Okumoto). 

None of them really do anything thematically tied to their noms de guerre, so I guess they just thought they sounded cool. By the way, in a group of characters with thematic names, sometimes one just doesn't fit the pattern (a trope known as Aerith and Bob); in this case that would be Lola (Reid), Luc's girlfriend.

Luc is the ""leader of a satanic cult"" whose ""motive"" is that his ""father [was] killed by an Indian."" This doesn't make much sense until we discover that Moses (Richard Cumba), the ""Indian"" who murdered Luc's father, is a priest of some religious denomination — Catholic in appearance but that allows its priests to marry and have children, and to which also belongs father Harold (Trejo), whose daughter Lilly (Emmanuelle Chriqui) is the girlfriend of Jimmy Cuervo (Furlong), who is on parole after serving a prison sentence for killing a rapist, who happened to be Moses’s son. It’s a small world, indeed.

War, Famine, Pestilence, and Lola help Luc escape from prison, and the five proceed to ritualistically murder Jimmy and Lilly; the rest, as they say, is history: Jimmy returns from the afterlife to exact revenge on his killers one by one, reserving for them such cruel and unusual punishments as death-by-bug zapper. 

Oddly enough, no one besides Jimmy seems interested in pursuing the escaped convict whose gang leaves a trail of blood wherever they go. Then again, this is a movie that uses the word “Aztec” to refer to a Native American tribe. 

All things considered, I’m tempted to believe that TC: WP's self-parody is intentional; for example, Luc offering his henchmen a banquet consisting of deviled ham, deviled eggs, and devil's cake “al flambeau”. I'm not saying it is to The Crow what Army of Darkness is to The Evil Dead but, incoherent or not, it's the only one apart from the original that’s even close to watchable.",3.0

<em>'The Crow: Wicked Prayer'</em> is not a good movie. However, it commits so hard to what it wants to do that I was kinda locked on to just see where it would go next. It particularly goes off the rails towards the conclusion, especially with David Boreanaz's Luc. There are many, many issues with this 2005 release, but I honestly didn't hate viewing it.

I think what helps (relatively speaking) is that there are quite a few familiar faces on the cast, which definitely keeps you watching - or it does for me, at least. You have the aforementioned Boreanaz, as well as Tara Reid, Danny Trejo and Dennis Hopper. Emmanuelle Chriqui is in there too. The main face that I didn't know of was actually Edward Furlong, who plays the titular character.

Furlong's performance isn't, like the film in general, anything worth praising. Again though, he proper goes for it so his onscreen presence never annoyed me. Nothing about this really irritated me to be honest, it's just plainly obvious from pretty much the get-go that the flick isn't anything all that good so I guess my expectations were low.

The Picture of Dorian Gray is directed by Albert Lewin, and he also adapts the screenplay from the novel written by Oscar Wilde. It stars Hurd Hatfield, George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, Donna Reed, Peter Lawford, Lowell Gilmore, Richard Fraser and Douglas Walton. Music is by Herbert Stothart and cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr. 

Dorian Gray of Mayfair and Selby. 

Oscar Wilde's Faustian tale about a young Victorian gentleman who sells his soul to retain his youth is given a magnificent make-over by MGM. Pumping into it a budget reputedly of $2 million, the look and feel is perfect for this macabre observation of vanity, greed and self destruction. In many ways it's still an under valued movie, mainly because there will always be Wilde purists who think it lacks the writer's poetic spikiness, while horror fans quite often venture into the picture expecting some sort of violent classic ripe with sex, drugs and debauchery unbound. 

Lewin crafts his film in understated manner, never allowing the themes in the source material to become overblown just for dramatic purpose. He cloaks it all with an atmosphere of eeriness, thus keeping the debasing nature of Dorian Gray subdued. The horror aspects here mostly are implied or discussed in elegantly stated conversations, where the horror in fact is purely in the characterisation of Dorian himself. We really don't need to see actual things on screen, we are urged to be chilled to the marrow by his mere presence, and this works because Lewin has personalised us into this man's sinful descent by way of careful pacing and character formation. 

There are some jolt moments of course, notably the famous inserts of Technicolor into the black and white film, the impact of such bringing the portrait of the title thundering into our conscious. However, this is not about thrill rides and titillation, because the film, like its source, is intellectual. Lewin is aided considerably by Stradling's beautiful photography, which in turn either vividly realises the opulent abodes or darkens the dens of iniquities, so just like Lewin, Stradling and the art department work wonders and prove to be fine purveyors of their craft. 

Hatfield is wonderful, it's an inspired piece of casting, with his angular features and cold dead eyes, he effortlessly suggests the black heart now beating where once there was a soul. Yet even he, and the rest of the impressive cast, are trumped by Sanders as Lord Henry. Cynical, brutal yet rich with witticisms, in Sanders' excellent hands Lord Henry becomes the smiling devil like mentor perched on Dorian's shoulder. Dorian and Lord Henry are movie monsters, proof positive that not all monsters need to be seen hacking off limbs or drinking blood. In this case, the decaying of the soul is a far more terrifying experience.

16608,"Well, no matter how I rate this movie a lot of people are going to say that my rating is wrong. That is something that you probably can say about any rating for any movie. I feel it is especially true as far as this movie goes though. As you can see from my rating I was not exactly thrilled by the movie. That does not mean that it is a bad movie. Again, this you can say about a lot of ratings, especially my ratings.

Okay, I guess I have confused everyone enough now so let me try to explain. As a piece of cinematic art this movie is excellent. The acting is quite good. I especially liked John Hurt as the literate bounty hunter but most of the main characters where performing admirably. The scenery is wonderful. The Australian outback makes for a excellent backdrop and it is indeed a nice change from the classical North American western sceneries.

As a movie it falls flat though. In my opinion a movie should at least try to tell a story. Even if it aspires to be a piece of art it should try and tell a story that the audience can, in one way or another, follow. This movie have a basic idea of a story but it does not really tell a story. We never get to know who the bad guys really are, what they really did, except for a bunch of hints about killing and rape, or why. Heck, we never actually get to know of the guy the flogged to death where really taking part in the deed or not.

Throughout the movie the bad guys are supposedly hiding in some place where it is impossible to get them so the main character tries to get the bad guys brother to kill him. Not very plausible at all. The governor, Eden Fletcher played by David Wenham, or whatever he as supposed to be was pretty much an asshole. Okay every movie has to have one but his role was never really developed. Once he managed to get the young kid, innocent or not, flogged we really do not see much of him for the rest of the movie.

The end of the movie is much the same as the rest of the movie. Cinematically excellent but not much of a story. There is no real conclusion. It just ends in a sequence of well done scenes but without any real story behind it.

16608,"Australia. A man looking to catch a criminal by the name of Arthur Burns (the head of the Burns Gang). He catches his brothers instead, and offers the elder brother (Guy Pearce) a deal. A proposition. Bring him Arthur Burns, the man who raped and killed Eliza Hopkins. And to make sure that Charlie will honor the deal, he keeps the youngest brother, Mikey.

The stage is set early on in the movie, and yet, this is more than just a simple story about a gang of criminals and the law enforcers who are chasing them down, this is a story about a country being created, about the fight for survival in a strange land. About justice and peace of mind.

Nick Cave wrote the screenplay, and also most of the music. This gives us a hint that it is not going to be your average movie, but something... more, something different. We can also expect the sound to be spectacular and forceful, and indeed, it is. The music here very much reminded me of the music in There Will Be Blood by Paul Thomas Anderson, extraordinary and... haunting really. But it doesn't stop at the music, the visual side of the movie is rather stunning in a haunting way as well, dirty and dusty all the way through. I love when a movie has a distinct visual style and rhythm, and this one does.

The movie starts out with a bang, as the law enforcers hunt down the two younger brothers, Charlie and Mikey, but as soon as Charlie is given the proposition, it slows down considerably and branches out to tell two stories, that of Charlie hunting down his brother, but also that of Captain Stanley and his wife, two opposing forces. This guy clearly has demons of his own, and is looking for justice to be served. I love the pace in this movie, it wants to tell its story just right.

The cast is a great one, as mentioned Guy Pearce plays one of the Burns brothers, together with Danny Huston. These guys are dirty and bend on doing whatever it takes to survive. Captain Stanley is played by the amazing Ray Winstone. He plays the role with a quietness and a subtlety that surprised me. He is the hero of the story, at least for me, and wants only justice to be served. In other parts we see David Wenham and John Hurt, both delivering quirky and interesting characters. A great movie needs a great cast, and this one most certainly have that.

_Last words... this movie does not compromise. It is honest, it is dark and it forces you to think about right and wrong. How does one identify a criminal and what forces people to do evil deeds? Nothing is simple really, and it shouldn't be. Most people have both light and darkness within them, and that is the case in this movie._",7.0
16614,"Mottola strikes one from the heart. 

It's 1987 and James Brennan is home for the summer after earning himself a degree in Renaissance Studies. Which unsurprisingly isn't any use to him when trying to gain employment in this part of Pittsburg. Which is now a problem since his planned trip to Europe has fell by the wayside due to his father's enforced unemployment. So thus he finds himself working at Adventureland, a rusting time warp amusement park where only odd balls and idiots appear to frequent. But here James will make friends, learn life lessons and maybe just find true love?. 

Be under no illusions, Adventureland is no teen sex comedy reliant on crude jokes and cringe slap-stick moments to get its humour. Which as it's brought to us by the director of Superbad may come as something of a surprise. Greg Mottola is the said director, who here has crafted an ode to his own teenage strife's concerning first jobs and first loves. Though not really offering anything new as such, I mean the old ""summer I came of age"" film is hardly new is it? Mottola has however managed to blend youthful spirits with a serious kink and nicely cloak it in a bittersweet 80s haze. 

Some parts are clearly aimed at the guffaw teen viewers, awkward erections and friends who punch you in the testicles - tee hee hee, Adventureland feels, and is, a subtle film made by someone who clearly lived it. The care and thought that Mottola has put into it benefits the cast as much as it does the viewers. Jesse Eisenberg (James) is a splendid bit of casting, almost poetically slow, he nicely plays it to have the upcoming tribulations totally believable. Enter Kristen Stewart as Em, pretty and smartly essaying a girl, soon to be woman, trying to make sense in her off kilter world. Her scenes with both Eisenberg and the buff Ryan Reynolds, in a role that takes some skill to get as right as he does, are the highlights of the piece. While Martin Starr is the other performance of note as the pipe smoking intellectual, Joel. 

What youngsters that I know who have seen the film have had less than favourable reactions to it. This can probably be put down to two things. One is that the expectation of another Superbad-a-like comedy has not been met. Two is that, you know what folks? Mottola hasn't made this for kids, he's made it for those who were once kids themselves in a decade not so very long ago... 8/10",8.0

The Mindhunters of the title are a group of FBI profilers who as part of their training are sent to a remote island to solve a mock crime in a mock town. Their mission is to form a profile of a serial killer known as The Puppeteer, trouble is, is that The Puppeteer turns out to be real and starts picking them off one by one.

Directed by Renny Harlin and featuring a bonkers story written by Wayne Kramer, it doesn't take an FBI profiler to know what sort of film this is going to be. Featuring a cast that contains LL Cool J, Jonny Lee Miller, Patricia Velásquez, Val Kilmer and Christian Slater, Mindhunters is undeniably preposterous cinema for the easily pleased masses, and yet it's still hugely enjoyable and isn't found wanting in the ingenuity stakes. 

The killers secret is closely guarded, which keeps the Ten Little Indians (yes this is another Agatha cover version) like mystery going, and the manner of the deaths have a morbid freshness about them - with one in particular being outrageously thrilling. A few scenes are neatly crafted by Harlin, who is after all is no slouch in the action genre (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, The Long Kiss Goodnight), while the swimming pool finale is taut and tight and the killer reveal genuinely a surprise. 

Yes there's problems abound in the film, but isn't there always in this kind of ""B"" movie hogwash? The cast do what is required as they work through some pretty naff dialogue, and any expectation about caring for any of these characters should be set at option zero. However, it's a nice fit for Harlin, as it finds him comfortable in the knowledge that we want whizz bang murder death kill, and thus he delivers.

It's a colourful and large scale series of fantasies that tug at the heart strings, make you smile, wince and tap your toes - just as the vivid imagination of the author would have had them do. Kaye plays the role in a characterful and engaging manner, depicting well the poverty, optimism and, yes, the chocolate box Denmark too, as the film takes us through synopses of some of the most politically subtle and potent ""fairy tales"" ever written. More than that, it's a visual feast with beautifully crafted costumes and scenery - though, the production looks at times, a little stage bound. Of course, to ice this cake, we have a beautiful soundtrack from Frank Loesser with a little help from Messrs. Schubert and Liszt delivering us timelsss standards that are maybe not the most lyrically challenging, but are songs of so many of our childhood's that show Kaye for the multi talented star that he was. I was not a massive fan of the choreography - I found it too precise and a little sterile at times, but the individual dancers are world class and when the story drifts into his fantasy world and leaves the fables to do the work, this is a thoroughly enjoyable 2 hours of escapism.",7.0

A family in an affluent neighborhood north of Chicago tries to recover after a tragedy. Timothy Hutton plays the troubled son who gets help from a therapist (Judd Hirsch) while Donald Sutherland & Mary Tyler Moore play the seemingly okay parents.

“Ordinary People” (1980) was Robert Redford’s debut movie in the director’s chair and it was a huge success. The story is two-pronged: It’s a coming-of-age drama about the anxious son at home, school, therapy and his relationships with the fairer sex, as well as a marital drama about the parents.  

This was Hutton’s first theatrical movie, but you wouldn’t know that by his powerhouse performance, which is on the level of Brando. It’s interesting how simple, realistic drama can be more compelling than some overblown “blockbuster” with an explosion every five minutes.

Winsome Elizabeth McGovern is a highlight as one of the girls the son dates.

On the negative side, the storm sequences are pretty artificial, reminiscent of a TV flick, and the story almost drowns in its unrelenting drama in the last act (I said “almost”).

16633,"**A forgotten film that deserves to be revisited, even with all its flaws.**

Personally, I liked this film. It's one of those films that fell into oblivion very quickly, which doesn't seem fair to me: the film is much better than many more expensive and publicized productions, even though it has serious problems, which I'll talk about. Perhaps very few, besides the producers and cast, really believed in it: it didn't receive much attention from studios and theaters, it was a huge success in Asia but was ridiculed in the USA, while Europe seems to have ignored it.

The film has a very good, but small, cast: Christopher Reeve was still reaping the rewards of the success of “Superman”, but that didn't stop him from putting in a lot of effort into this smaller work. The actor is a solid protagonist, and his work is one of the levers that moves the film forward and gives it quality. Next to him, we see the elegant Jane Seymour, still quite young, in a performance full of dignity and where she establishes excellent chemistry with Reeve. Christopher Plummer was less fortunate: the actor, whose credits and talent are beyond doubt, received a cliché and quite artificial character because the villain was necessary to the plot anyway, and had to be someone sufficiently worthy of our disdain.

This leads us to talk about the script, which has its merits and also many demerits: the story is based on a somewhat mystical passion between Richard Collier, a modern-day playwright, and Elise McKenna, a young and successful actress from the past. Right at the beginning of the film they meet when she, already elderly, gives him a watch and says a few short and mysterious words to him. Eight years later, he becomes fascinated by a young woman, portrayed in 1912 in a room in an old hotel, discovering her identity. He then decides to try self-hypnosis to go back in time and find her.

The script thus creates a kind of love at first sight, in which the object of passion is a photograph of someone who has long since passed away and who you have never met. Just the idea itself seems bizarre, and things don't get better when we introduce time travel and the notions of regression and self-hypnosis, which only the “new age” crowd will really value in some way. Perhaps it would have been preferable to travel through “traditional” time through some machine, portal or “wormhole”.

Technically, the film shines due to the choice of filming location (the hotel still exists and can be visited) and the design of the sets and costumes, full of details and well made, worthy of the Oscar nomination in 1981. The editing is quite regular, and the film unfolds without haste, but also without dull moments. The cinematography comes in joyful warm colors and the soundtrack is dominated by two distinct, but by no means incompatible, tonics: the excellent Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini Op. 43, by Rachmaninoff, and a hypnotic and striking melody composed by John Barry.",4.0
16638,""" And the Cid rode through the gate and into legend ""

El Cid is the story of legendary Rodrigo Diaz who lifted his country with valour and integrity to drive the Moorish invaders from Spain.

I think the best thing I can say about this film is that even though it's nearly three hours long, I never once look at the clock. It's a thoroughly engaging picture that boasts all the great hallmarks of a sweeping historical epic. The colour, the costumes, the scope, and the attention to detail from director Anthony Mann are first rate, and par for the course is the suitably rousing score from Miklos Rozsa. Big square jawed bronzed beefcake Charlton Heston takes the lead role as Diaz, and firmly cements himself as the go to guy for gargantuan epics. Support comes in the form of Sophia Loren, Genevieve Page, Raf Vallone, John Fraser (excellent), and Gary Raymond (also excellent).

The story is an excellent one because Diaz was such a fine character from the annals of Spanish history, uniting the sulking Christian kings of Spain whilst simultaneously lifting the people of the streets off their knees and getting them to believe in the cause. However, it has to be said that this is far from the perfect historical epic movie, even allowing for the usual Hollywoodisation of facts, one can't quite get past the fact that El Cid comes across as a glamorised glory tale without any hindrances. Surely here in the 11th century El Cid's path would have been fraught and sodden with a great deal more death and destruction? There's a tameness where there should be serrated edges to the story and it takes away greatly from the film's end because the build up of Cid's heroism actually didn't contain a great deal of hard work - it was a stroll in the park so to speak.

Still, it's a wonderful film that ticks all the boxes for genre staples, and as churlish as I may be as regards the assumptive nature of El Cid's story being told here, I'm still the first to start cheering and thumping my chest as the credits role, and not even Sophia Loren's pout can distract me from the bravado warmth washing over me. 8/10",8.0
16638,"_**Ranks with the best sword & sandal epics**_

In the latter half of the 11th Century when Spain consisted of Christian kingdoms and Moorish strongholds, Castilian knight Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (Charlton Heston) becomes known as ‘El Cid,’ meaning “the lord,” after generously showing mercy to a couple of Emirs, who orchestrated an attack on a Spanish city. This gets him accused of treason, but he proves his nobility, courage and skill to King Ferdinand (Ralph Truman) and his successors (Gary Raymond, John Fraser & Geneviève Page). Sophia Loren plays his romantic interest while Herbert Lom is on hand as a Berber general hell-bent on Islamic world domination. Raf Vallone appears as Rodrigo’s cunning rival for Jimena’s affections    

“El Cid” (1961) is curiously obscure compared to other classic sword & sandal epics, like “The Ten Commandments” (1956), “Ben-Hur” (1959) and “Spartacus” (1960), but it’s just as great and on par with the more modern “Troy” (2004), not to mention superior to the overrated “Braveheart” (1995) and “Gladiator” (2000). Even if you disagree with me on those last two films, “El Cid” stands well with any of these epics.

I knew enough about Rodrigo’s real-life story to know that the political intrigue gets convoluted and wondered if the movie could keep everything understandable and compelling for the course of three hours; and it does (unlike 2005’s “Kingdom of Heaven”). Just before the drama overstays its welcome a quality action scene manifests, Like Rodrigo’s thrilling duel with Jimena’s father. I also appreciated the subtext of dealing with flawed people in leadership positions and overcoming resentment to have effective working relationships.

For those who object to Heston being cast as a Spaniard, the Castilian aristocracy of the 11th Century was generally Visigothic in ethnic background, aka German. Despite the regular influx of people of color ever since, there are plenty of Blond Spaniards to this day, even redheads. (Remember, Spain is decidedly Europe and not Mexico).

16638,"El Cid is “the story of Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar [Charlton Heston] ... a simple man who became Spain's greatest hero. He rose above religious hatreds and appealed to all Spaniards, whether Christian or Moorish [not unlike how JCVD ​​befriended Jews and Muslims in The Order, in which Heston also appears], to confront a common enemy that threatened to destroy their land of Spain.” 

Rodrigo's unifying work is facilitated by the fact that Moors and Christians have a common language, although this lingua franca is not, as one would expect, Spanish but rather English — apparently the official language not only in the Iberian Peninsula but also in the rest of Europe, and North Africa.

I mention this because I can't help thinking that a lot must have been lost — and replaced — in the translation between El Cantar de Mío Cid and this film directed by Anthony Mann; then again, El Cid is not based on the Castilian epic but in the French tragicomedy Le Cid by Pierre Corneille (which explains — but does not justify — that Rodrigo's wife, played by Sophia Loren, is called Chimène and not Jimena). This is a big mistake.

The anonymous author of Mío Cid begins his poem in media res, with the exile of the Cid — a point that Mann takes almost two hours to reach, and even then practically in extremis. Everything that happens before this moment can be classified as excess foreplay.

Don Rodrigo, on his way to wed Doña Chimène (although in those days even a 27 year old Loren would have presumably been already considered an old spinster), rescues a Spanish village from an invading Moorish army. 

Two of the emirs, Al-Mu'tamin (Douglas Wilmer) of Zaragoza and Al-Kadir (Frank Thring) of Valencia, are captured. More interested in peace than revenge, Rodrigo escorts his prisoners to Vivar and frees them on the condition that they never again attack the lands of King Ferdinand of Castile (Ralph Truman).

For his act of mercy, Don Rodrigo is accused of treason by Count Ordóñez (Raf Vallone). At court, he’s further accused by Chimène's father, Count Gormaz (Andrew Cruickshank), the king's champion. Rodrigo's elderly father, Don Diego (Michael Hordern), calls Gormaz a liar. Gormaz slaps Don Diego, challenging him to a duel. In a private meeting, Rodrigo begs Gormaz to apologize to the elderly but proud Diego. Gormaz refuses repeatedly, so Rodrigo challenges him to a duel and kills him. Chimène witnesses Gormaz's death and swears to avenge him, renouncing her love for Rodrigo.

Here the writers really screwed the pooch; I know there was no way that Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren weren’t going to end up together, but how the script goes about it is nothing short of asinine: Rodrigo persuades the King to force Chimène to marry him as payment 'for services rendered.'

This approach is reminiscent of Richard III 'wooing' of Lady Anne, or even Henry Fonda’s treatment of Claudia Cardinale in Once Upon a Time in the West; the problem is that those two were the villains of their respective stories, while Rodrigo is supposed to be the hero of this one — and yet, despite everything, Chimène eventually, willingly accepts her status as a trophy wife, because what woman can resist her father’s murderer? Why they didn't just have Gormaz instigate the duel, and have Rodrigo kill him in self-defense, I’ll never understand.",2.0
16642,"Following the story of Bill (Richard Gere), a hard working laborer in the early 19th century, Days Of Heaven is a cinematic masterpiece. Accompanied by his girlfriend, Abby (Brooke Adams) and sister (Linda Manz), Bill departs on a steam engine for a lone wheat farm in Texas for work. The journey is a long one, but director Terrence Malick makes the ride pleasant with beautiful shots of nature at its best.
The rest of the movie follows suit. Although once at the farm the labor is arduous for the three characters, they find solace in being surrounded by the natural aesthetics. Everything is made even better when Bill, against his better judgment, convinces Abby to marry the owner of the farm. Life becomes carefree.
The common thread that ties the film together is the depiction of nature. The plains of Texas are exactly that–plain. Malick is able to capture this simplicity and turn it into something extraordinarily beautiful. A common theme emerges–the relationship between humans and nature. At times the relationship can be a close one, as illustrated by the carefree frolicking through the fields. However at other times, by piecing together wide shots of the plains, Malick portrays humans as insignificant in comparison to nature.  While the two are contrasts, the two work together to form a cohesive depiction of nature. This relationship is especially illuminated by the attempt to industrialize the farm. Steam engines and massive coal powered plows stand tall over the individual farmhands. One can look at these massive machines as an attempt for man to conquer nature and assert his dominance.
Additionally, Malick is able to give nature emotion, almost as vivid as if it was an animate object. Wheat blowing back and forth in the wind while the sun shines through the clouds provides for a very melancholy and relaxed mood. The breeze is almost palpable on one’s cheek. Yet, when the massive machines arrive and the farmhands are forced to do intense manual labor, the calmness disappears. Life becomes hectic. This contrast shows the duality of nature. For every pleasant thing in life, there is a bad thing as its complement– much like heaven and hell. This is extremely apparent when Bill attempts to leave the farm for the second time. As he leaves the farmer’s residence, he hears a droning sound. Before Bill or the viewer understands what is happening, the sky opens up with locusts. The farm literally becomes engulfed in these insects coming straight out of the ten plagues. All hell breaks loose–sirens sound and hundreds of workers tried to get these locusts off the farm. All that is beautiful–the wheat, the sky, and the vast emptiness of the plains–is covered up. It is almost as if hell is covering the heaven on earth. This allegory becomes even clearer once a fire erupts. The days in heaven are clearly over as the fire cannot be contained and the beauty is physically destroyed. Following the duality in nature already established by the movie, heaven is subsequently restored. Although most of the crops are gone after the fire, the land still has an aesthetic quality to it. And although Bill and Abby never find solace after fleeing, Bill’s sister finds herself enjoying life again after reuniting with her friend. Just as it had been during the days of heaven, she is carefree again.",9.0
16642,"Outstanding. My second favourite Malick film next to Badlands. I'm not sure anyone has ever been better at photographing fire. The only other of his films I have seen thus far is 'To the Wonder', but it's films like this that make me such a lover of cinema. I'm not a Richard Gere fan in the slightest (though I have always loved Brooke Adams), but it's roles like this that cement his reputation as a cinematic icon in my books. I didn't say 'actor' because I'm not really sure that's his strength--it's more a presence, such as Alain Delon in 'Le Samourai'.",9.0

Anyway, in this rather poignant story he is ""Bill"" who works in a smelter in Chicago whilst living with ""Amy"" (Brooke Adams) and his younger sister ""Linda"" (Linda Manz). He's not happy, and after the latest in a series of lively squabbles with his foreman, the three decide to quit the city and head to Texas where they find casual work on farm. As the season progresses, it soon becomes clear that the owner of the farm (Sam Shepard) has taken a bit of a shine to ""Abby"". He is poorly and ""Bill"" reckons that he isn't destined to be long for the world, so ""Abby"" agrees to marry him so that, in due course, they can inherit the whole shebang! Thing is, though, someone's been telling some fibs and the perhaps the farmer isn't quite so close to his sell-by date as many had been led to believe! Things only get murkier when we learn that ""Bill"" has a past - and that past is homing in on their new lives and threatening their triumvirate. It's gently narrated by ""Linda"" and the story from Terrence Malick is tightly packaged into a quickly paced ninety minutes of characterful, sometimes poignant, drama. Shepard gets the plaudits from me, his performance stands out but generally this is a decent ensemble effort that guides us through a story of avarice, loyalty and menace with aplomb.

La resa dei conti (The Big Gundown) is directed by Sergio Sollima and written by Sollima and Sergio Donati. It stars Lee Van Cleef, Tomas Milian, Walter Barnes and Gerard Herter. Music is by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Carlo Calini.

Superior Spaghetti Western with shades of Zapata for good measure, The Big Gundown finds Van Cleef as bounty hunter - cum -  unofficial lawman Jonathan Corbett, whose reputation for bringing in the criminals, dead or alive, has caught the attention of business baron Brockston (Barnes). With an interest in getting into politics, Corbett is sold on Brockston’s offer of political help if he will do a job for him. The job is to hunt down a Mexican rogue by the name of Cuchillo (Milian) who is alleged to have raped and murdered a 12 year old girl. Tracking Cuchillo across the land, the Mexican proves to be a slippery customer, and more importantly, Corbett begins to doubt the veracity of the charges against him.

Adios Amigo.

What do you need for a great Italo Western? A leading man with screen presence supreme? Check! Rogue antagonist able to overact opposite the leading man whilst still exuding charm personified? Check! Scorching vistas? Check! A musical score so in tune with the story it’s a character all by itself? Check! And violence? Check! Sollima’s movie has it all.

Much of the film is about the manhunt and how the two men involved develop a relationship. Cuchillo claims he’s being set up and seems to have friends in every town featured in the play. Corbett is a dandy with a gun, but he’s not perfect, he can be outsmarted and get caught cold. There’s good thought gone into the screenplay in this respect, not putting the anti-hero up as an infallible superman.

Then there’s the side-bar narrative strands that show Sollima’s political bent, even though this is hardly a heavily politico piece. From class struggles and racism, to asides on the justice system and the fat cats who operate around the system, Sollima does enjoy dangling such carrots. With zippy set pieces fuelled by brooding machismo that is in turn enhanced by the top work from Carlini and Morricone (it's one of Moricone's best scores, real dynamite), this is grade “A” Spaghetti and well worth feasting on. 9/10",9.0

It’s about the exploring bug hunter “Jumpei” (Eiji Okada) who finds himself a bit lost out in the sand dunes after he misses the last bus of the day. A friendly villager offers him some shelter for the night, buy boy is he ill-prepared for quite what that man, and his entire village, has in store. He is placed with a widow, but when he wakes in the morning discovers that her home is deep within a sand well and the only way out is the ladder he climbed down to enter - and that’s gone! It’s a precarious existence for this women (Kyôko Kishida) for if she doesn’t keep the sand levels down, they will swamp her home and swallow her up. The villagers assist in so far as they help dispose of the collected sand and they provide her - and now him - with some weekly rations, but she has no inclination to leave her pit and they seem content to watch him scratch about in the sand just as he was to look at creatures with more legs doing the same. Gradually a bond starts to build between the two, but he is always on the look out for a means of escape, and his captors know that - exacting some torrid vengeance upon both of them as a sort of sport after an attempted escape goes awry. In the end, he begins to realise that it’s distinctly possible that he, she or both may die in the hole and his options aren’t getting any better from day to day. It’s really quite a cerebrally gruesome film to watch this. To see two human beings toyed with as a cat would a mouse is a tough watch and both actors really do deliver strongly, imbuing their scenario with respective senses of acceptance and frustration. At times there are almost cruelly pagan elements to the behaviour on display here, but it is also just possible that there is a scintilla of goodness intended somewhere along the line, too? It’s tautly directed and the sparing but increasingly frenetic dialogue really helps to create a feeling that actually made me feel a little breathless at times.

This is in that run of unnecessary sequels Disney did to make some cheap bucks; it's (clearly) also right after they started in with digital animation.

While they managed to capture Peter and the lost boys fairly well, Hook and Shmee are more like loose cartoony references to their former selves.  Jane and Wendy seem to have the most detail put into their animation.  The (classic) crocodile was replaced with an octopus (but still includes a suction cup version of tik-toking) by a visual director that barely understood what an octopus was.

Now, being that I'm generally opposed to the octopus in general, I happen to know a few things about octopus so giving it snail-like eyes, a beak AND teeth, as well as an over-sized tongue broke me a little.  The behaviors were typically way off, to include swimming with it's arms above water (they typically help with the locomotion) and some weird physics when climbing the boat.

Also, we've pretty much pinpointed the inspiration for Neverland Island, which does actually include salt water crocodiles, but as it is in the Caribbean, this Giant Pacific Octopus  is completely out of place.

The animation style was also shifting from scene to scene, object to object.  Sometimes it is very jarring, a digital cell character atop a cg rendered log, or other times it's a cg rendered background against the digital cell animation of the ship (or vice versa) that really took me out of it as it just looked so unnatural.  I'll site ""Titan A.E."" (Fox) and ""Treasure Planet"" (Disney) as too different examples where it was blended much more smoothly.

I actually like the premise better: Hook kidnap's Wendy's daughter, but the movie does so many weird things.  Even though the original movie was officially set in the 1950s, Wendy grows at least 4-6 years to 18 to have a 12 year old daughter and a (generously) 3 year old boy, but the entire world travels backwards to WW2.  Even if we retro the original setting, make Wendy....30?, that means the original occurred in 1929 at the latest, as this sequel could occur during 1945 at the latest, and I just did more math than I'm comfortable with to enjoy a movie.

And this bad movie has the audacity to drop like real dilemmas in the middle: obligation to family vs trustworthiness, acceptance of others, and this crazy mechanical suggestion about how The Fey of the island work.  Does belief of faeries / pixies matter, is it disbelief that actually harms them?

Phillip Raven is a hit man of no obvious moral fibre, he literally will kill anyone for the right price. After fulfilling a contract for the chocolate munching Willard Gates, he finds himself pursued by the law on account that he was paid by Gates with stolen money. Raven sets out for the ultimate revenge and dovetailing towards the explosive finale with him is sultry conjurer Ellen Graham and honest cop Michael Crane.

Based on the Graham Greene novel ""A Gun For Sale"", this is not a straight out adaptation, the plot has been re-jigged with very impressive results. The most enlightening thing I found when reading up on the film was that the studio were so blown away by the efforts of Alan Ladd as Raven, they turned the script around to make him the film's chief axis, and boy what a smart move that was for this is Alan Ladd's show all the way.

Ladd plays Raven with brilliant icy veneer, he's cold and devoid of emotion, his only trip to anything resembling caring is an affinity to cats - because in his own words, ""cats don't need anyone, they are on their own, just like me"", the result is one of the most unnerving killers put on to the 40s cinema screens. Veronica Lake is the stunning female of the piece, she glides through the picture with ease as Ellen, a character with her own issues, but thankfully she's integral outside of any sort of romantic plot, even though she is the only one who gets close enough to Raven to learn anything about what makes him tick. 

Robert Preston as Michael Crane was to be the pics focus but he becomes a mere side part thanks to Ladd's barnstorming show, and unsurprisingly Laird Cregar is suitably shifty as Gates. It's a fine film in its own right, it's tightly filmed, wonderfully scripted and contains a great noir ending, but ultimately it's all about the cold as death hit-man Raven - and of course the great performance by the man who played him. 8.5/10",9.0

I wasn't sure how I felt about this movie until about a day after I watched it. I've come to the conclusion that it was mediocre. It felt like a revisit of every bad slasher flick I'd seen for the last 20 years. I do have to give credit to Tobe for humanizing some of the victims. Let's be honest, in the typical slasher flick the victims are usually drunken or doped up, teen-age sex fiends that you could care less about(and may actually enjoy seeing them get taken out:) The killer is equal parts psycho/supernatural, and his origins, limitations, and needs are never fully explained.

16771,"“Do you know what Dr. Johnson said? Guests, like the fish, start to stink on the third day.” 
“In fact, I think you'll find that I start to stink on the first day.”

This exchange exemplifies the good and the bad about Barcelona; it’s full of acerbic Johnsonian sarcasm beautifully channeled by Chris Eigeman, but the third act feels more like the third day, with all that this implies.

The film, about two young American cousins ​​and their misadventures with the female fauna of the titular city, has another problem. The cousins, Fred and Ted, are skillfully and competently played by Eigeman and Taylor Nichols, respectively — Nichols's forced verbal tics only manage to make him seem like an ersatz Woody Allen (unusual for for writer/director Whit Stillman, who tends to evoke favorable comparisons to the legendary filmmaker), although he makes up for this with a scene described by Fred as “some weird religious ceremony based on Glenn Miller” — but the Barcelonans they get involved with are played by Australian, English, or American actresses; this is particularly jarring when it comes to the character played by Mira Sorvino, who is neither Spanish nor has the acting ability to pass for one.

Applying the Italian neorealist approach, literally any randomly selected passerby on a Barcelona sidewalk would have done a better job; on the other hand, it’s possible that my complaint is irrelevant, especially considering that the females in the story are practically interchangeable. 

Even though he spends most of his time courting Marta (Sorvino), Fred ends up falling in love with Montserrat (Tushka Bergen); according to him, “I've seen her in all sorts of different situations and contexts” — situations and contexts that must have occurred in scenes written but not shot, or shot but ultimately cut (the script simply shrugs it off, mentioning towards the end that “We spend hours together on the phone, and she is so fascinating and charming”). Meanwhile, Ted ends up marrying Greta (Hellena Schmied), a late addition to the plot with whom Ted doesn't share much more quality time than Fred does with Montserrat.

But perhaps this is precisely the point; as Ted says, “you see a beautiful girl and immediately you’re subject to all these emotions … you haven't even talked to the girl, and you already want to get married and spend the rest of your life with her”. 

He suffers from ""a real 'romantic illusion' problem,"" and yearns, ""instead of a fantasy built on the pretty slope of an eyebrow or the curve of an upper lip, to see the real person. Maybe even look into her eyes and see her soul."" 

In that sense, the film is a true reflection of, as Roger Ebert put it in his review, ""a vast yearning which can only be filled by a girl"" that most of us experience before we reach the age of reason; sadly, Fred doesn’t seem to outgrow this juvenile yearning during the course of the film, and there is no indication that his relationship with Greta is less based on ciliary sloping and/or lip curvature than on the ""real person.""",5.0

1942, Nazi occupied Norway, and the Germans are making great strides with their plans for atomic weaponry. It’s down to a band of resistance fighters and a scientist to blow up the German heavy water factory located up in the Telemark mountains. 

Perhaps it’s stating the obvious considering Mann and Krasker's reputations as quality visualists, but The Heroes of Telemark is a splendid looking war movie. It’s solidly performed by the cast, the story, which is based on a real and crucial incident in the war, is gripping, while some of the tech flourishes shown by Mann for the more pacy scenes are impressive. 

Problems only really arise when the film resorts to standard character interactions, shifting focus away from the film’s strength, that of the mission, the planning and execution of such. The script doesn’t really give the characters much to work with, so in truth it’s hard to really care about them in context to their own personal trials and tribulations.

16859,"When watching films by Japanese animation powerhouse Studio Ghibli a number of adjectives come immediately to mind; imaginative, wholesome, and quirky, to name a few. And there is perhaps no more quirky Ghibli film than _Kiki's Delivery Service_.

Fundamentally, _Kiki's Delivery Service_ is a coming of age film, telling the story of 13-year-old trainee witch Kiki who leaves home with her cat Jiji to continue her training. Arriving in a far-off European city, Kiki starts a flying delivery business, couriering goods around the town, which catches the eye of aviation-obsessed Tombo, who is immediately smitten by her flying.

One of the big draws of Ghibli is the simplicity of the stories, making them hugely accessible for the audience. In Kiki's Delivery Service we must just accept that there are ""some"" witches and even though people will possibly never see one, they are not feared. In fact, the only fear in Kiki's Delivery Service comes from Kiki's own self-doubt.

Considering, then, that Japan is far more conservative than the West - especially when it comes to family values - it is quite bizarre that one conservative Christian group in America took the decision to boycott the film solely for the purpose of glamorising witches.

But really, Kiki being a witch is completely secondary to the film. In some ways it could be argued that Kiki being a witch is simply another excuse for director Hayao Miyazaki to view another Ghibli world from the sky, allowing his team of animators to draw some of the most beautiful landscapes in animation.

In addition, it allows Kiki's comic foil to be a talking cat (who, in the English dub, is voiced by the instantly vocally recognisable Phil Hartman, who you may remember from such shows as _The Simpsons_, where he plays Troy McClure). As well as dominating most of the film's funnier moments, Jiji also depicts Kiki's transition from innocence.

Despite all of this marshmallowy innocence, _Kiki's Delivery Service_ is still a quirk. The plot is littered with unanswered questions - what happened to the other flying witch who was returning home? - and the final act involving the dirigible is, frankly, too overdramatic and out-of-place with the rest of the down-to-earth storyline.

Still, it is perfectly enjoyable, and while it isn't necessarily the first Ghibli I would recommend, it is still one that you should see.",6.0
16869,"**_Refreshingly different alternative WW2 drama/adventure_**

RELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Inglourious Basterds"" takes place during the German occupation of France in WW2 and revolves around a ruthless “Jew Hunter” Nazi (Christoph Waltz), a beautiful young theater owner dripping with vengeance, a German war hero who pesters her and a brutal team of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine.

This was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies. The first time I tried to watch ""Basterds"" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.

I eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the ""interminable dialogue"" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.

There ARE elements that bring to mind ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but ""Basterds"" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.

All effective films have quality characters and ""Basterds"" has several: The stunning Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.

Like Tarantino’s other great movies (“Pulp Fiction,” “Django Unchained” and “Jackie Brown”), ""Basterds"" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic ""blockbuster"" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they’re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer’s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it’s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.

An ambitious loan officer at a bank in Los Angeles (Alison Lohman) wants an imminent promotion above her rival and so makes the “tough decisions” by refusing compassion to a desperate aged borrower. Big mistake. Justin Long is on hand as the young woman’s beau.

“Drag Me to Hell” (2009) marked Raimi’s return to the overdone comic book horror of his “Evil Dead” flicks after achieving blockbuster success with the “Spider-Man” trilogy. While unpleasant in ways since it deals with the assault of an evil spirit, the lamia, it’s all-around superior to the first two “Evil Dead” movies (I’ve never seen “Army of Darkness”).  

A critic who hated it claimed that it had no message. Whether people appreciate what the flick has to offer or not, it does have a message amidst its exaggerated comic booky thrills. A pretty glaring one on the surface along with interesting details if you go a little deeper.

Lohman is winsome on the feminine front while Bojana Novakovic has a brief but notable role as the old crone’s granddaughter.

This is a sumptuous costume drama based on the real life story of an elderly Queen Elizabeth's infatuation with the much younger and more reckless Earl of Essex. There is an engaging chemistry between them - though the script does rather drag at times; and the usual suspects in support - including Olivia de Havilland; Henry Stephenson, Henry Daniell & Donald Crisp keep the whole thing moving along nicely. This is also the first film in which I actually recall Vincent Price having a more substantial part in, too. Lots of theatrical licence taken with the actual turn of events, but hey - it is all good fun...",8.0
16905,"What a creature must sit on the throne who lets a man like you deal out his justice!

Captain Blood is directed by Michael Curtiz and adapted by Casey Robinson from the Rafael Sabatini novel. It stars Errol Flynn, Olivia de Haviland, Basil Rathbone, Ross Alexander and Lionel Atwill. Music is scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and photography is shared between Ernest Haller and Hal Mohr.

1685, England, and Dr. Peter Blood (Flynn) is unjustly convicted of treason against the King. Escaping the death penalty, Blood and the other supposed rebels are sold into slavery at the English colony of Port Royal. Bought by kindly Arabella Bishop (de Havilland), Blood settles down to work as physician to the local governor. But when the town comes under attack from the Spanish, Blood and his friends seize the opportunity to commandeer the Spanish ship and escape...

And Thus Captain Blood Began His Career Of Piracy. . . With A Ship, A Handful Of Men, And A Brain. . . 

It could all have been so different had Robert Donat not turned down the role of Captain Blood. In came Flynn at the last minute, a swaggering superstar was born and classic cinema got a handful of truly rousing swashbucklers that continue to delight millions even today. Not to mention it also brought further notice of de Havilland's ability, with this picture the first of eight she would make with Flynn. Even though it was seen of something of a gamble for Warner Brothers at the time, the film actually isn't that big in budgetary terms, all the remarkable, then, that Curtiz and his team have fashioned such an entertainingly rousing picture.

Although Flynn gleefully dominates proceedings, and in the process gives the film its only real flaw by rendering much of the other characters to being like awe-struck observers, much of the credit for Captain Blood's success is down to Robinson's screenplay. Running at just over two hours in length, film is chocked full of action, plot and asides to the British monarchy of the 17th century, deftly split into two halves by the wily Curtiz. First half establishes the major players and incidence, taking a good honest man in a hot political climate and forcing him to go rogue. This then fills the second part as Blood becomes the feared pirate of the high seas, and then ultimately his journey back to a life of normality and love flecked happiness. 

In amongst this journey to piracy and back, film is decked out with moments of spectacle. Be it Flynn swishing and swashing with blade, or swinging in on a rope, or the sight of cannons blasting away in tall ship duels, Curtiz ensures the pace is brisk and the adrenaline is often stirred. In the mix is the chemistry between Flynn and de Haviland, which obviously hits the ground running, and two deliciously shifty turns from Messrs Atwill and Rathbone. Stunts are aplenty and although the sets are at times at the bare minimum, Curtiz and his photographers get maximum impact by going for a near Expressionist style. All of which is scored with thunderous verve by master composer Korngold. 

Flynn would better this with both ""The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)"" and ""The Sea Hawk (1940)"", but Captain Blood is undeniably the influential template. 9/10",9.0
16912,"Escape from Colditz Castle.

Guy Hamilton directs and co-adapts the screenplay with Ivan Foxwell from the P.R. Reid novel of the same name. A story based on actual facts, it stars John Mills, Lionel Jeffries, Bryan Forbes, Anton Diffring, Richard Wattis, Ian Carmichael and Eric Portman. Music is by Francis Chagrin and cinematography by Gordon Dines. 

The story essentially follows the repeated escape attempts by allied prisoners held at Colditz Castle. It shows the hard luck stories, the bonds that are formed between the men, the regime and day to day life they lived by, and of course it builds to the historical finale. 

It's structured with great balance by the makers, who manage to wring out a number of tense sequences whilst also ensuring that humour shines brightly. It gives the pic the requisite feel of stiff upper lippery, imbuing the characters with justifiable heroism in the face of being a POW, which all told plays as inspirational stuff. 

Acted with aplomb by a notable cast, this delightful pic harks back to a a grand time of British film making, while simultaneously doffing its cap towards the real life allied soldiers who wound up in war prison establishments. 8/10",8.0
16912,"This film does rather play to the stereotypes a bit - the plucky Brits; disorganised French; stoic Dutch and generally enthusiastic Poles - and as such should be treated more as a piece of fact-based entertainment rather than some sort of documentary-style analysis. It does still, however, demonstrate clearly what must have been the feelings of despair and frustration when the gates are heard to close and the prisoners' freedom lies tantalisingly but inaccessibly close. Eric Portman and Lionel Jeffries steal this for me (I always found John Mills just a touch too arrogant and superior). Once the castle is up to full strength and the inmates start to collaborate, this become an excellent showcase for what can be done when there is a will. There is plenty of humour too - the ""croque mort"" joke still makes me laugh even now.",7.0
16914,"This has to be one of my favourite wartime adventures that really quite powerfully illustrates not only the perils of those sailing the Atlantic during the Second World War but the courage of the ordinary folks drafted in to man these tiny ships at the mercy of the weather and the U-boats. ""Ericson"" (Jack Hawkins) has been put in command of an convoy escort that's staffed by a rather obnoxious former used-car salesman ""Bennett"" (Stanley Baker) and two green-around-the-gills sub-lieutenants ""Ferraby"" (John Stratton) and ""Lockhart"" (Donald Sinden). Initially, their task is mainly to keep afloat in the turbulent waters but as continental Europe falls to the Nazis, the threat from Grand Admiral Doenitz's wolf-pack system of submarine attacks makes their jobs even more deadly. With their enemy largely unseen and highly manoeuvrable, it's difficult enough to see one let alone attack it, but they've all got a job to do. There's a strong dynamic here between Sinden and Hawkins and the story is peppered with back references to the lives ashore of many of the crew who have families in a homeland that is constantly being bombed. It was made long after the war finished, but it still manages to convey an effective sense of the danger - physical and emotional - faced by these men who left home uncertain as to what might await them on their return. It grittily encapsulates so much of the human story of the war, but there's also a little time for some romance (cue Virginia McKenna) and a little light banter from Liam Redmond, Bruce Seton and the always reliable Megs Jenkins who can't be bothered to fix up the blackout curtains. Moira Lister adds a bit of shallow glamour to the proceedings and by the half way mark we have a pretty comprehensive appraisal of the people's Royal Navy that's well captured by some chilling photography and haunting audio.",7.0
16938,"***Historical slasher with John Saxon, Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder*** 

It’s the Christmas season at a sorority house in the Northeast wherein an ambiguous psycho hiding in the attic makes crank calls to the girls and slays them one-by-one. John Saxon plays the local detective.

“Black Christmas” (1974) obviously influenced “Halloween” (1978), e.g. the closet scene, but was influenced itself by psycho slasher flicks like “Psycho” (1960), “Dementia 13” (1963) and “Silent Night, Bloody Night” (1972).

Honestly, the 2006 remake has a more absorbing story which, to me, is the best indicator of a quality movie. This version is dull by comparison, particularly the first half, but it picks up steam in the second. And the open-ended climax is interesting. 

But I strongly prefer the female cast in the remake; they're just all-around superior IMHO. Of course Olivia Hussey is attractive in this rendition, albeit cold, and Lynne Griffin as Clare is winsome, although her part is small. Andrea Martin (Phyl) comes across as a shorter version of Cher with short, curly hair. Unfortunately, Margot Kidder as Barb is one of the most obnoxious characters in cinema, a real turn-off (so is Mrs. Mac, but less so). Thankfully, Barb's only prominent through the first half.

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Toronto.

Each character has a purpose. By that, I don't mean simply to drive the plot along. Each character is a person, and they each have their own unique personalities and motivations. Barb isn't just the drunk and morally abrasive stereotype; she's driven by her jealousy and likely by issues from her childhood. Each character feels about as deep as her, at the least.

16938,"Black Christmas decorates traditional festivities with blood, suffocation and disturbing phone calls. Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! And have a slashin’ good time! The slasher sub-genre was most proficient during the mid-to-late 70s, with ‘Texas Chainsaw Massacre’, ‘Halloween’ and a plethora of spicy Argento features to add a worldly aesthetic. However, one film that innovated the tropes and traits commonly found in the aforementioned titles, was Bob Clark’s Black Christmas. A horror “slasher” (if you can classify it as that...) where an anonymous serial killer remains secluded in a sorority house, gradually picking off the girls one by one. Just in time for Santa to come down that warmly lit chimney and deliver them coffins wrapped up in cute little bows.

To say that Black Christmas was revolutionary and a blooded sprout for the blossoming sub-genre to come, would be an understatement. A nameless unknown killer that exhumes mental instability? Check. An expendable cast of characters that stupidly investigate ominous sounds by themselves? Check. Excruciating tension with every camera movement? Absolutely! Surprisingly, now that I’ve witnessed various films during the conception of a horror movement, it’s incredibly easy to see how influential Black Christmas is. Not for its innovative concept, as other simpler thrillers utilise slashing techniques with efficiency (‘Psycho’), but rather for its technical proficiency.

Clark’s direction, whilst unpolished, is solid throughout. Taut camera pans to explore the darkened hallways of the sorority house. Minimal sound editing to heighten the suspense. Excellent use of shadows to illustrate the antagonist’s anonymity. Sublime POV perspective to place the viewer in the shoes of the killer. And a ramped up conclusive act that will have anyone watching perched on the edge of their seats eagerly anticipating to unwrap the plot twist, even if that narrative turn was predictable from the offset. The camera can be visible on specific occasions, mostly through reflections in picture frames as it glides through hallways. Emphasising that unrefined quality of Clark’s novice-like direction. It does give the feature some flavour, perhaps not the jolly festivities one was yearning for. More egg nog than champagne.

Yet what really injected some holiday spirit into the story, were the characters. Uniquely all acquiring a distinguishable personality that made them different and relatable. The shady drunk friend or the intellectual gal who has all the common sense (that is until she goes wandering by herself...!). The point is, they were all memorable, and that’s a rare achievement in slashers. The second act, where the campus police become involved, does stagnate the overall pace with minimal storytelling momentum. Fortunately the third act immediately picks it back up for an explosive bauble of...slashing.

So despite the lack of actual slashing, overall unrefined quality and inconsistent pacing, it’s an extremely enjoyable horror flick that takes a gentle holiday season and turns it into a crazy murder-sesh. Perhaps my new annual Christmas film? We’ll see...! I am sadistic after all!",7.0
16938,"I suppose a sorority can be used to host a multitude of characters, so that's what Bob Clark does here as he puts four quite different girls into an house supervised by the likably dypso ""Mrs. Mac"" (Marian Waldman). The house has, for ages now, being getting crank calls from a guy they call the ""moaner"". Some get upset by his behaviour, others laugh it off but when one of their number ""Clare"" (Lynne Griffin) disappears and the police are called in by her boyfriend ""Chris"" (Art Hindle), the sense of menace ratchets up a notch. As we get to know these characters, there are quite a few suspects and quite a few decent reasons why we might want to bump them all off. ""Jess"" (Olivia Hussey) is expecting a child with wayward boyfriend ""Pete"" (Keir Dullea) only he doesn't know it yet; give-as-good-as-you-get ""Barb"" (Margot Kidder) quite likes to goad their would-be tormentor (""Billy"") - much to his obvious chagrin. More menacing yet is the increasingly detailed knowledge contained in the calls. ""Billy"" is spookily well informed. Could he be one of them? I'm not too sure what this has to have to do with Christmas, to be honest. It's just another typical slasher set amongst a student fraternity that gives everyone an opportunity to scream and make some shockingly poor under-pressure decisions. Neither the acting nor the writing stand out but the photography is quite effective at creating and sustaining a modest sense of peril as our killer nears goal. It's not really very scary, indeed time hasn't been to kind to it at all - but it's watchable if you like the genre and have taken a drink or two.",6.0

Trying not to give much away, I will just say that the first problem involved a huge coincidence involving a new guest at the hotel. I mean, what are the odds, you might ask yourself as you watch it. It could have survived that unlikely coincidence if left on its own, but then there came a point when suddenly I knew how it was going to end and I thought, “Surely not!” But yes, the reversal at the end that I suppose was to provide karma and balance instead seemed to me to be amateurish and, as noted a moment ago, horrifyingly predictable.

Out of MGM, The Asphalt Jungle is directed by John Huston and based on the novel of the same name by W.R. Burnett. It stars Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen, Sam Jaffe, Louis Calhern, James Whitmore, Teresa Celli, and in a minor but important role, Marilyn Monroe. Miklós Rózsa scores the music and Harold Rosson photographs it in black & white. Plot sees Erwin ""Doc"" Riedenschneider (Jaffe) leave prison and quickly assemble a gang to execute a long in gestation jewellery heist. However, with suspicion rife and fate waiting to take a hand, the carefully constructed caper starts to come apart at the seams.

John Huston liked a tough movie, having given film noir in America a jump start with The Maltese Falcon in 1941, he also that same year adapted W.R. Burnett's novel High Sierra. Burnett also had on his CV crime classic stories Little Caesar & Scarface, so it's no surprise that Huston was drawn to The Asphalt Jungle. As it turned out, it was a match made in gritty urban heaven.

The Asphalt Jungle was one of the first crime films to break with convention and tell the story from the actual side of the criminals. Where once it was the pursuing law officers or private detectives that were the heavy part of the plotting, now under Huston's crafty guidance we have a study in crime and a daring for us to empathise with a bunch of criminals, villains and anti-heroes. As a group the gang consists of very differing characters, and yet they have a common bond, for they each strive for a better life. Be it Hayden's luggish Dix, who dreams of buying back his father's horse ranch back in Kentucky, or Jaffe's Doc, who wants to retire to Mexico and surround himself with girls - it's greed and yearning that binds them all together - With alienation and bleakness, in true film noir traditions, featuring heavily as the plot (and gang) unravels.

With gritty dialogue and atmospherically oozing a naturalistic feel, it's also no surprise to note that Huston's movie would go on to influence a ream of similar type films. Some good, some bad, but very few of them have been able to capture the suspense that is wrung out for the actual heist sequence in this. Fabulous in its authenticity, and with that out of the way, it then sets the decaying tone for the rest of the piece. Interesting to note that although we are now firmly in the lives of the ""gang"", including their respective women (Hagen, Monroe & Celli all shining in what is a very macho movie), we still know that the society outside of their circle is hardly nice either! This is stripped down brutalistic film noir. Merciless to its characters and thriving on ill fate, and closing with a finale that is as perfect as it gets, this is a top line entry in what is the most wonderful of film making styles. 9.5/10",9.0
16969,"Shocking what Prohibition causes some people to drink these days.

The weight of expectation for City Heat was massive, two iconic Hollywood actors together in a buddy buddy cop movie, one with nods and homages to film noir and old school gangster movies, it wasn't unreasonable to expect a movie to sit with the best on Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynold's then CV's circa 1984. Unfortunately it's no masterpiece or close to being in the upper echelon's of each actor's respective works. But that doesn't make it a bad film.

A change of director saw Blake Edwards replaced by Richard Benjamin after Eastwood and Edwards, ahem, couldn't see eye to eye, so that immediately put the film on the back foot in many critic's eyes. Ironically Benjamin does OK - working from Edwards' script (there's a whole bunch of back stories and tittle-tattle assigned to this film if you care to search for it). Lots of fun here, though, as Clint and Burt, one a cop, the other an ex-cop turned PI, reluctantly team up to cut a swathe through the gangsters ruling the roost in prohibition era Kansas City.

Eastwood does his straight backed machismo act, throwing awesome punches along the way, while Reynolds is wonderfully cheerful as a tough guy who all things considered, would rather not get hurt! The script is full of zingers, delivered with customary sardonic self parody by the stars, while the roll call of supporting actors is not to be sniffed at. Period detail is high end, with Nick McLean's photography carrying the requisite neo-noir impact, while the music tracking is pleasingly nostalgic.

It's over the top of course and needlessly convoluted as per its yearning to be noirish, yet if you can cut back your expectation levels? And you can simply enjoy the sight of Eastwood and Reynolds having fun romping in this period? Then you just might enjoy this more than you dared to believe. 7/10",7.0

Camilla and Rebecca Rosso play the lead twins. I like how they switched it up from a solo main, it feels slightly unique from the two other movies. With that said, the acting level from the Rossos isn't the best and the (presumably exaggerated) British accents are a bit irritating/distracting.

Also onscreen is Christopher Cousins, fellow <em>'Breaking Bad'</em> fans will find that minorly interesting. Another member is Bobby Campo, an actor I like from underrated made-for-television Xmas flick <em>'Snow Bride'</em>. As you can tell, the cast is this film's standout element.

I couldn’t help but notice that one of the methods of death early on here was later borrowed by the series House of Cards (U.S. version).

Back in his 17 year old bod (Zac Efron looking like a young Rob Lowe), Mike oversees the trials and tribulations of his two kids who attend the same school, whilst also forming a ""special"" bond with his future wife Scarlet (Leslie Mann) who is going to divorce him!

A dispirited 37 year-old man (Matthew Perry) is about to lose his wife and high school sweetheart. Through a ""spirit-guide"" (Brian Doyle-Murray) he is miraculously able to become, you guessed it, 17 again. His younger self is played by Zac Efron, who's actually the star of the movie. Leslie Mann plays his soon-to-be former wife while Thomas Lennon appears as his geeky best friend. Sterling Knight & Michelle Trachtenberg are on hand as his kids struggling through the teen years. Melora Hardin plays the attractive principal while Nicole Sullivan has a glorified cameo.

""17 Again"" (2009) is magic from beginning to end, with few missteps. It's both a high school dramedy and a second chance fantasy. There are elements of films like ""Back to the Future"" (1986) and ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" (1986), but the uniqueness here is that the protagonist doesn't go back in time, but rather stays in the current day and appears to his family & friends as 17 years-old, even though he's really 37. With one exception, no one knows who he really is.

Efron, who was only 21 during filming, easily carries the film while Mann is one of the most winsome women to walk the Earth. Lennon's amusing character is akin to the Big Bang Theory guys.

Like most British productions of this sort, it depends upon a talented ensemble cast rather than a few superstars as top billing.

It has also been a long time since I have read Jane Austen’s that this movie is based upon, and after seeing how this and two other versions stray from each other’s, in small ways that is, I would be curious to know how often each one remains true to the original. But that is not necessary to enjoy this well made production; it merely makes we wish I could take my favorite parts from all three versions to create a new whole. Failing that, I will merely say that this production, as with the others, should be acceptable to Jane Austen lovers who aren’t mortified by the least changes to her books.

I don’t know how easy it might be to track down this movie. As I understand it, it was originally released on British TV, but PBS in the United States had shown an interest due to a popularity of Jane Austen adaptations at the time, so that had allowed for an increased budget to film at actual sites in the book, built up some interest, and then was released as a feature film in theaters before it appeared on PBS, complete with an introduction by Russell Baker.

Screenwriter Dixon Steele is very talented, he also drinks too much and is prone to outbreaks of shocking violence. Thus the studios are reluctant to hire him, but through sheer determination, his agent manages to get him a coveted writing assignment to adapt a popular novel. The main players in the proposed picture meet up at a restaurant to talk things out, but with Dixon being Dixon it all goes wrong and violence curtails the evening. Though not really keen to read the novel he is to adapt, Dixon accepts an invitation from the hatcheck girl to read for him as it's her favourite book, they both go to Dixon's home and nothing untoward happens between the pair, he bids her farewell and puts out for her cab fare home. The next day the police show up at the door requesting Dixon accompany them down to the station, turns out that the poor hatcheck girl was murdered and dumped on the roadside, Dixon of course is the chief suspect. But a glint of light appears in the form of Dixon's beautiful neighbour, Laurel Gray, who provides Dixon with a solid alibi, this sets in motion a relationship between the pair that might break or make either one of them.

In A Lonely Place is a fabulous picture, not nominated for any academy awards (incredible in light of Bogart's stunning portrayal as Steele), and tagged on its release as being too bleak to be a winner, it's now rightly considered one of the best films of its type and contains some of the best work from those involved. What always amazes me with the film is how the two halves are so very riveting for different reasons. The first half we are trying to understand Steele's conflict with himself (a wonderfully complex character), he is our sole focus of attention. Then the second half as Laurel and Dixon enter into a full blown relationship, we find ourselves in Laurel's place, as Dixon grows ever more erratic, we join Laurel in her unease, it feels like a coiled spring waiting to unleash itself. 

It's quite an achievement that director Nicholas Ray blends the pictures' halves together and dabs them with darkly affecting visuals, whilst simultaneously taking us on an up and down ride as to how we feel about Dixon Steele and the girl he has clearly fallen in love with. This is not just about the actors (Gloria Grahame as Laurel is also as fabulous as Bogart is) and the director, though, a tip of the hat has to go to the source material by Dorothy Hughes and Edmund H North and the adaptation by Andrew Holt. The ending here is different to the one in the book, but personally I think this one works better because it has a quandary cloud hanging over it, not in a short changed way, but in a deeply unnerving way, the kind that sets you pondering over a cold glass of beer. 

Terrific stuff here for those willing to invest undivided time with it, a film that is now rightly revered as a classic, so just as Dixon Steele is up on that old knife edge, the makers are asking you to hop up on that edge alongside him, so do it and you wont be disappointed. 9.5/10",9.0
17057,"Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame are on great form in this complex and intricate crime noir. He (""Dixon"") is a down-on-his-luck writer who finds himself squarely in the eyes of the police, suspected of murder. Fortunately, and somewhat out of the blue, his neighbour turns up at the station and gives him a cast iron alibi. She (""Laurel"") saw the victim leave his home, and he stayed put! Now at this point, we have no reason to disbelieve her, but as the story develops and the two become more intimately connected, we start to see certain flaws appear in both of their characters that starts to make us doubt which (if either) of them might be telling the truth. The police haven't given up on him either, and their investigation and his consistently wayward behaviour soon has everyone on edge. It's a well paced and well written drama this, that plays well to the skills of the two stars. They exude a chemistry that is just as suspicious as it is loving. We are never quite sure where we are - not until the rather effective denouement which was not really what I was expecting. If you can watch this for ninety minutes on a big screen: it offers a richness of photography and a gripping George Anthiel score to complement a strong story well controlled by Nicholas Ray who is also at the top of his game.",7.0

This week's Noir of the Week is Scarlet Street.
Its one of my favorite films. Most of you already know the story and hopefully have seen the new release of the film on DVD from Kino International.

The film was directed by Fritz Lang and was based on the 1930's French film, La Chienne.

Scarlet Street is about a common bank cashier in the 1930s who succumbs first to vice and then murder. I won't give the plot away, because I'd run out of room writing all the film's twists and turns.

What I enjoy about this film is the common man (played by Edward G. Robinson) is as selfish as Kitty and Johnny (Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea). There isn't a good person in the whole story. Even his boss (cheating on his wife) and wife (old battle-axe) are evil to a degree. Most critics seem to think the film is a carbon copy of The Woman in the Window. I have to disagree. In that one, Robinson and Bennett are sophisticated and smart (OK, Duryea is the same). Robinson is spending the evening with the beautiful girl on a lark - just so he can brag to his friends. In Scarlet Street, Robinson plays a man who married his wife because he was dying of loneliness. In the middle of Scarlet Street, he says ""I've never seen a naked woman!"" to his wife giving us a pretty good hint that they never even consummated their relationship. Cross is a dreamer. His two dreams stated in the film was to become a painter and to have a ""young girl"" fall in love with him. He gets both. But his idea of love and art are selfish.

In the book Dark City: The Film Noir by Spencer Selby, Selby writes how two of the characters view art; and how their view helps define them:

""The idea of wishful dreams, around which Scarlet Street is built, becomes strongly linked with the idea of art. Cross' standing as Johnny and Kitty's key to riches is totally dependent upon his identity as an artist. To Johnny, great art is a ""dream come true"" solely because it is worth a lot of money. With Cross, the association of art, wishful dreams and glamorous love was first established in that early dialog with the friend. The link is extended and further clarified when he compares his love for Kitty to his love for art. Though more genuinely aesthetic than Johnny's, this association is really just as selfish and subjective. For both characters, art represents a dreamlike escape from the problems and frustrations that plague mundane existence. Johnny's dream takes a beating when he pierces the illusion of Cross' artistic fame by selling two of his paintings. However, in doing this he has set the stage for real success and a new illusion. As the work of Kathrine March, Cross' paintings become instantly popular and valuable. Johnny engineers this deception solely for his own profit, but thematically his action further reinforces the important link between art and illusion.""

Selby hits the nail on the head. Art for Johnny means money and for Chris romantic love. Both of these things will eventually destroy both of their lives. Watching the movie again I was taken by the three performances.

Robinson plays the sap great. He's not as innocent as I first thought. True, he's run through the ringer. But in the end he kills a woman and lies to send a man to the electric chair. First, I thought that he was haunted by guilt after their deaths. He's not. He's haunted by the fact that he was made a fool of by Kitty and Johnny. Sitting in his room alone at the end he hears Kitty and Johnny's voices taunting him. They're telling him that now they can be together in death all thanks to him. Robinson's performance is more physical than verbal. When he knocks Johnny to the ground with an umbrella in a silent attack, he throws his arm in front of his face trying to block a blow that never comes. Much later, before he kills ice princess Kitty with a pick (appropriate), he walks into the room all hunched over looking much older than when he was walking on clouds in love. And how 'bout when he's forced to do the dishes wearing a flowery apron? Classic.



Bennett in the film is the ultimate vamp. In the new print you can see her facial expression change to really tell what she's thinking. Hint: it's usually not what's coming out her mouth. Sure, Chris must be blind not to see he's being taken, but Kitty plays her role well. I love her apartment with dishes pilling up in the sink and her spitting grape seeds around the place. She's a lazy slob with some great legs. Bennett plays the part just right. She like Johnny even though he slaps her around. In fact, that's why she likes him. She states that if Chris wasn't so nice to her she would like him better. Kitty will do anything for Johnny and that's what gets her killed.

Duryea is the big bad wolf. Boy is he good in this. Never has a performer been so good at entertaining as well as delivering on a part. The first time I saw this film, about ten years ago late at night on A&E, I remember flipping through a few books trying to find out who this guy was. He plays Johnny just right. His cloths even match his attitude. Everyone knows someone kind of like him. Johnny's always involved in schemes and trying to make it big without really trying. And blaming everyone else for his failures. Remember when Chris walks in and sees the two together in bed? What does Johnny do? He blames Kitty. In fact, every time something goes wrong, he blames her. Can you imagine anyone else pulling off the role?

Of course, the film isn't just about the performances. Lang and his crew put together a stunning looking film. There are a number of scenes showcasing the films lighting and camera work (Milton Krasner is the Director of Photography). When Kitty is killed in the white bedroom by Chris; and Chris being haunted by voices in his seedy room come to mind. The script is filled with great dialog and quotable noir lines.

Fritz Lang may be remembered for Metropolis, but for me his gift to film lovers is Scarlet Street.",10.0

Christopher Cross, in middle aged, and in a life going nowhere and devoid of love and inspiration. Till one evening he rescues Kitty March from a mugger, it's the start of a relationship that has far reaching consequences for them, and those closest to them.

The previous year director Fritz Lang had made The Woman In The Window, a film that was hugely popular with critics and fans alike. Here he reunites from that excellent film with Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea, the result being what can arguably be described as one of the best exponents of Film Noir's dark sensibilities. Adapting from works by André Mouézy-Éon and Georges de La Fouchardière (novel and play), this story of desperate love and greedy deceit had already had a big screen adaptation from Jean Renoir in 1931 as La chienne, which appropriately enough translates as The Bitch! Now there's a Noir title if ever there was one! What Lang does with this adaptation is drip his own expressionism all over it, whilst crucially he doesn't ease off from the harsher aspects of the story. This is nasty, cruel stuff, and with Lang at the time feeling a bit abused and used by the studio system he was slave to, who better to darkly cloak a sordid story with a biting edge? Is it purely coincidence that Lang took on this film about a struggling artist who's vision is stifled by another? Possibly not one is inclined to feel.

Edward G. Robinson is fabulous as the pathetic Chris Cross. Married to a wife who constantly heckles and belittles him (Rosalind Ivan), Robinson's take on Cross garners empathy by the shed load, so much so that once Kitty (Bennett) and her beau, Johnny Prince (Duryea), start to scheme a scam on Chris, the audience are feeling as desperate as Cross was himself at the start of the movie. Few noir guys have so meekly fell under a femme fatale's spell as the way Cross does for Kitty here. But such is Lang's atmospherics, you not only sense that it's going to go bad, you expect it to, and naturally Robinson is just the man to punch us in the guts with added impetus. Bennett and Duryea are very convincing, almost spitefully enjoying taking the hapless Robinson character for everything they can, and the visuals, especially during the bleak, shadowy last couple of reels, cap the mood perfectly.

This film is in truth probably saying more about its director than anything else that he made. And in fact it was said to be one of his all time favourites. That's nice to find out because it finds him on particularly good, and yes, devilish form. Grim, brilliant and essential film noir. 9/10",9.0
17058,"It's interesting to see Edward G. Robinson cast as the downtrodden bank cashier, trapped in a loveless marriage, who has a penchant for painting. He comes to the rescue of a damsel in distress ""Kitty March"" (Joan Bennett) who is having a tough time with her loutish boyfriend ""Johnny Prince"" (Dan Duryea). He falls for her hook, line and sinker only to discover she has assumed that he is a wealthy man and she tries to manipulate and embezzle from him. Soon, he is caught in a cyclical trap and we know he is heading for disaster. What is most odd is the sight of Robinson in an apron preparing some liver.

17058,"Why on earth did they decide to colourize _Scarlet Street_? This is a film where every shadow, every drop of rain, and every grimy street corner needs to be black and white to intensify its moody, bleak atmosphere. The grayscale isn’t just aesthetic; it’s the very essence of the story’s dark descent and the bleakness surrounding its characters. Stripped of that stark, high-contrast style, it loses the bite and grit that makes it a quintessential noir. The decision to colourize it feels almost sacrilegious, robbing it of its noir identity and the raw power of Fritz Lang’s vision. This vision should be preserved and respected.

Thankfully, I found a version of _Scarlet Street_ that had not been subjected to unnecessary and destructive colourization. In its original black-and-white, the film finally exuded that dark, oppressive vibe that colour could never capture, allowing Lang's film to hit the way intended.

17102,"Lee returns as Dracula after an 8-year absence.

RELEASED IN 1966 and directed by Terence Fisher, “Dracula: Prince of Darkness” focuses on two English couples circa 1900 traveling the mysterious forests of Eastern Europe who are warned to stay away from a particular area that has an ominous castle. Fools that they are, they end up spending the night and the sinister Count is resurrected. 

Hammer did nine Dracula films from 1958 to 1974: 

Horror of Dracula (1958); The Brides of Dracula (1960); Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966); Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968); Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969); Scars of Dracula (1970); Dracula AD 1972 (1972); The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973); and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974). Christopher played the Count in every one of these except ""The Brides of Dracula"" and ""The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires."" As such, ""Dracula: Prince of Darkness"" was Lee's return to the role after a long eight year absence.

Most Hammer fans praise the first film in the series from 1958, which was Lee's first gig as Dracula, and it is a solid entry with the typical Hammer highlights, like lush Gothic ambiance, bright colors, Lee & Cushing and bodacious women, not to mention Lee's diabolical interpretation of the Count and one of the most stunning horror scores by James Bernard. But the truncated story wasn't completely satisfactory and there were too many 50's limitations IMHO.

I prefer this sequel as it features all the Hammer hallmarks listed above, except Cushing. Some might complain about the slow first half, but I like the way the film takes its time and concentrates on the two couples, the spooky ambiance, and the build-up of suspense. Klove (Philip Latham) is a particularly creepy character with his courteous pretense. The way he resurrects the Count is a ghastly highlight. Interestingly, Lee doesn't have all that much screen time and not one line of dialogue, so he's basically a vampire bogeyman here. But the lush Gothic atmosphere is potent and the cast shines, especially Barbara Shelley as the doomed wife of a so-“cultured”-he's-stupid husband (Charles Tingwell). And Andrew Keir as Dracula's worthy antagonist, Father Sandor, a most formidable monk.

I also appreciated the elaboration on vampire lore by Sandor (Keir). One reviewer scoffed at the idea that the undead have to be willingly allowed into a person’s abode, but this fits the parallel of vampires to evil itself, which first affects a person’s mindset (ideology) and THEN their behavior or lifestyle. In short, evil cannot overtake a person unless s/he willingly allows it.  

THE FILM RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in Buckinghamshire and Berkshire, England, (with, perhaps, some establishing shots from Romania, e.g. the mountains). WRITERS: Jimmy Sangster and Anthony Hinds. ADDITIONAL CAST: Francis Matthews & Suzan Farmer play the other couple.

17130,"It was a long time ago since I saw this and all I remember was how bored out of my mind I was having to watch this film in the cinema along with a cousin of mine who is a girl. For what I can recall as I vaguely remember it, the story was all over the place, actually it was more like a film about ""nothing"". You got these 3 friends (Britney included) going on a road trip together (I know I'm just reading off from the plot lines here) and then they come across this guy who is your typical handsome guy at which point is where the film becomes a load of nonsense with nothing interesting happening, this is where the film pretty much gives up trying to be a movie and goes into soap opera territory but is worse.

What I actually find most baffling is that this film is supposed to be a ""romantic comedy"" film yet there was nothing in this film that was remotely funny. And Britney Spears thought she could have a good crack at movie acting, huh, I don't think so.

17131,"Hey, Rusty, Little Rubber Ball is back. I told you he liked the way we bounced him around.

The Glass Key is directed by Stuart Heisler and adapted by Jonathan Latimer from a story written by Dashiell Hammett. It stars Brian Donlevy, Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, Joseph Calleia, William Bendix & Bonita Granville.

It's re-election time and tough guy politician Paul Madvig (Donlevy) falls for reform candidate Ralph Henry's (Moroni Olsen) daughter, Janet (Lake). Subsequently he throws his weighty support behind Ralph Henry's campaign and irks the underworld gangsters, notably Nick Varna (Calleia). When Ralph's son, Taylor Henry (Richard Denning), is murdered, it opens up a world of corruption, violence, romantic passions and shifty shenanigans. A world that puts Madvig's right hand man, Ed Beaumont (Ladd) firmly in the middle.

Hammett's tale had already been filmed in 1935 with Frank Tuttle in the director's chair and featuring George Raft, Edward Arnold & Claire Dodd as the principal players. Few can argue that, now, knowing how film noir became a force in the 40s, a remake was more than appropriate. Heisler's movie boasts a bigger budget, a better cast and crucially a better screenplay. However, the film in truth has problems, even though it rightly crops up as an example of early film noir on account of the thematics at work, where corruption and wealth blends seedily with sexual ambiguity and amoral deadpanning. 

One of the key reasons for why The Glass Key has proved so popular over the years, is because of some dynamite scenes and that Ladd's character is so wonderfully hard to read. Ticking away is a mystery to be solved in the middle of the plot, which is driven by a mysterious protagonist - with Ladd excellently playing it up. That Ladd and Lake would make four films together is testament to their chemistry, yet although the knowing looks and ease with how they share the same frame is telling here, the film as a whole is actually the weakest of the three film noirs that they made.

Casting aside the flat visuals (oh for an Alton, Ballard or Musuraca) - and that much of the political corruptness is put in the background of the whodunit structure - the film also falls flat due to the cop-out ending. Now it's true that many film noirs, and other devilish off shoots of such, have favoured a more ""hopeful"" ending, and have got away with it to a degree. Yet here it's practically unforgivable, given the tone and all round uneasiness of the previous narrative bents, a tone that's driven by Beaumont's amoral ambiguity lest we forget. 

Why the hard edge ending from the novel is not used I'm not too sure, but ultimately it's the wrong decision. Still, there's enough to enjoy here while it runs. The cast do great work, notably William Bendix as a pathetic hard man dealing out sado-masochistic beatings to poor Edward, and Donlevy who blends his ""Great McGinty"" character with old time mobster traits. While of course solving the whodunit is fun and thankfully no easy task.

It's said that The Glass Key influenced the likes of ""Yojimbo"" and ""The Big Sleep"", which if true? is high praise all told. But as entertaining as the film is, and it is, this really should (and could) have been much better, and its reputation in noir circles to my mind is a little flattering. 7/10",7.0

Needless to say SPEED (1994) was definitely an inspiration for this movie, to the point that if they'd switch things around just a little bit it could have been a sequel to it.

And even though John Cena is better than he usually is in movies, he's just no Keanu (did I say that? Oh yes I did).

And Ashley Scott is definitely no Sandra Bullock and furthermore Aidan Gillen no Dennis Hopper.

That said, it's not terrible, SPEED (1994) to me is just one of the best blockbuster action movies of the 90's so the chance that it would match up to it would really be second to none.

Anyway back to this movie, it's okay fairly mindless popcorn entertainment, Renny Harlin is good when it comes to action-sequences and yet again he delivers on those aspects.

The Woman in the Window is directed by Fritz Lang and adapted by Nunnally Johnson from the novel ""Once off Guard"" written by J.H. Wallis. It stars Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Raymond Massey & Dan Duryea. Music is by Arthur Lange and Milton R. Krasner is the cinematographer.

After admiring a portrait of Alice Reed (Bennett) in the storefront window of the shop next to his Gentleman's Club, Professor Richard Wanley (Robinson) is shocked to actually meet her in person on the street. It's a meeting that leads to a killing, recrimination and blackmail.

Time has shown The Woman in the Window to be one of the most significant movies in the film noir cycle. It was part of the original group identified by Cahiers du Cinéma that formed the cornerstone of film noir (the others were The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Laura and Murder My Sweet). Its reputation set in stone, it's a film that boasts many of the key noir ingredients: man meets woman and finds his life flipped upside down, shifty characters, a killing, shadows and low lights, and of course an atmosphere thick with suspense. Yet the ending to this day is divisive and, depending what side of the camp you side with, it makes the film either a high rank classic noir or a nearly high rank classic noir. Personally it bothers me does the finale, it comes off as something that Rod Serling could have used on The Twilight Zone but decided to discard. No doubt to my mind that had Lang put in the ending from the source, this would be a 10/10 movie, for everything else in it is top draw stuff.

At its core the film is about the dangers of stepping out of the normal, a peril of wish fulfilment in middle age, with Lang gleefully smothering the themes with the onset of a devilish fate and the stark warning that being caught just ""once off guard"" can doom you to the unthinkable. There's even the odd Freudian interpretation to sample. All of which is aided by the excellent work of Krasner, who along with his director paints a shadowy world consisting of mirrors, clocks and Venetian blinds. The cast are very strong, strong enough in fact for Robinson, Bennett and Duryea to re-team with Lang the following year for the similar, but better, Scarlet Street, while Lang's direction doesn't miss a beat.

A great film regardless of the Production Code appeasing ending, with its importance in the pantheon of film noir well deserved. But you sense that watching it as a companion piece to Scarlet Street, that Lang finally made the film that this sort of story deserved.

A fracas ensues and the boyfriend is accidentally killed. Rather stupidly, he agrees with the woman to dispose of the corpse and try to cover it all up. Of course that doesn't work - soon, the cops are getting very close to the truth and she is being blackmailed. He is helplessly trapped between his own basic integrity and the innate charms of this unscrupulous woman. We are never quite sure which way he will turn - and the suspense is delightfully maintained right til the end.

17137,"Jan Paul Beahm (September 26, 1958 - December 6, 1980) 

Who? Well quite, and that may well be the problem for any casual movie fan who happens to like musical bio-pictures. Jan Paul Beahm during his short run for fame was better known as Darby Crash, lead singer and founding member of Los Angeles punk band The Germs. Firmly picking up on the punk ethic for doing it yourself, Crash and his band made waves across L.A. for a short period of time. Much like The Sex Pistols back in the UK, The Germs were blighted by being unable to play venues as their reputation preceded them. With Crash growing ever more erratic as he tried to execute the various strands of his so called 5 year plan, those around him invariably suffered. Here director Rodger Grossman attempts to tell the ""true"" story of the life and death of an enigmatic young man on a ""crash"" course to oblivion.

With low production values and a choppy attempt at being a semi rockumentary, What We Do Is secret is really only of interest to fans of the band or those wishing to bone up on American punk rock circa 1976-1980. Even tho myself, an ageing old British punker, quite liked The Germs, this film only exists because of two major factors. For the facts are that outside of L.A. they were hardly known at the time. It's only because of Crash's subsequent suicide at a young age {on the day John Lennon was shot and killed} and guitarist Pat Smear's future involvement with Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, that the band have had a reappraisal. With minimal input cut onto disc, one has to wonder if someone is trying to build up a legend that doesn't actually exist? What can be said with confidence is that the film at least brings the L.A. punk scene to notice. With all the historical talk about the New York punk scene that was born out of CBGB'S and Max's Kansas City, it often gets forgotten that L.A. had its moments too.

The cast here are pretty much the run of the mill performers one expects from such a production. Ranging from adequate (Shane West as Crash) to very decent (Rick Gonzalez of Coach Carter fame as Smear), Grossman's film will not be remembered for any great thesping. And since Crash is not very likable, or engaging on an intellectual level, the finale is unlikely to strike you with a sadness born out of the waste of a young life. However, the soundtrack crackles with punk vibrancy and emotive potency, and definitely some of the concert sequences have the look and feel of the original punk rock era. But ultimately the piece remains only worth an interest to an undemanding and small selection of music fans. Oh and 70s fashion guru's as well one thinks. 6/10",6.0

Any Which Way You can is directed by Buddy Van Horn and written by Stanford Sherman and Jeremy Joe Kronsberg. It stars Clint Eastwood, Sondra Locke, Geoffrey Lewis, William Smith and C.J. the Orangutan. 

Philo decides to retire from bare knuckle fighting, but when the Mafia come along and arrange another fight, he is spurred on to take another big money fight. The Black Widows motorcycle gang are still after his blood, Clyde the orangutan is still creating mischief, and Lynn Halsey-Taylor is trying to make up for breaking Philo's heart.

Much like the first film this is all very silly but ultimately great fun. Crux of the narrative is Philo being dragged back into the bare knuckle fight game to fight the street fighting king Jack Wilson (Smith excellent). All this and matters of the heart are trying to be repaired. Clyde the orangutan is once again a ball of mischief fun making, while the crowning glory that is the big fight is superbly staged and prolonged for grand effect.

There's a wonderfully fruity section that sees parallel seductions going on - including Clyde and a lady orangutan - and there's actually some adult writing in how the fighters are shown to be compassionate men, as opposed to just being brainless thugs making a few bucks.

It would be quicker to note what I liked about this - nothing - than to note the negatives. It's such a haphazardly created film, with every detail of it being either nonsensical, extremely forced or just dull. It's such a drag also, I checked the elapsed time at one point expecting to see at least 1hr 15mins... I had seen barely 40 minutes.

Clint Eastwood tries his best, I guess, and is one of the brighter parts, everyone else is very forgettable - including Sondra Locke's Lynn, who is all of a sudden the opposite to what they set up in the original.

The premiss of vengeance here ought to have provided for a more robust framework for this drama, but sadly the direction meanders and the film quickly loses the pace is starts with. There is a convincing vulnerability to Miss Field's performance, she plays the desperate mother well. Harris and Sutherland, however, feature far too sparingly with the latter simply failing to inject any menace into the proposition.

17203,"Seeing that this is a film about high-end barbering, isn't it odd that Josh Hartnett's fringe looks as if it were cut by his eight year old niece? Anyway, the gist of this light-hearted comedy is set around a northern English town hosting the National Hairdressing Championships. It's got a strong cast of British stalwarts - Warren Clarke, Natasha Richardson and Alan Rickman all chipping in to keep the rivalries, love interests and coiffure-quips flowing relentlessly. It's one of those films that is as notable for the stereotypes it challenges - of both the cutting trade and of the attitudes of the folks in working class England - as it is for any of the on screen performances, and that helps keep the joke running fine. No, the writing won't be up for a Booker prize, nor will the acting trouble a BAFTA jury ever, but the film has a certain spirit and the characters are not afraid to poke fun at themselves, award ceremonies in general and even the normally dreadfully wooden Bill Nighy manages to support the somewhat under-used visiting Hollywood star who did genuinely seem to be enjoying the whole charade.

Straight to DVD fare it may be, but it has some merit as a spooker to make it worth spending time with. Plot finds Joshua Leonard as a psychiatric intern who arrives at Cunningham Hall Mental Facility and quickly finds that all is not as it seems.
 
It’s hardly an original concept, that of a mental asylum housing something sinister, either supernatural or of human origin, but director and co-writer William Butler has a good feel for a chilly atmosphere, while he’s not scrimping on the shocks and terrifying imagery either.
 
The asylum is a suitably depressing place, unhealthily cold to look at and the patients milling about the place are the requisite hot-pot of sad cases and the disturbed. Then there is the basement ward, of course, where the extreme cases are kept in cells, and it looks like something straight out of Hades.
 
Jordan Ladd is on hand for eye candy and romantic thread duties, and Lance Henriksen adds his horror weight to the role of Governor of Cunningham Hall. It’s all very competently performed and constructed, the screenplay full of killings, dark corridor peril, secrets and a curveball twist thrown in as well.
 
It doesn’t push any boundaries, so searching for anything new here will only end up in disappointment. Yet it’s stylish and creepy enough to warrant a night in with the lights turned off. 6/10",7.0
17218,"Don't you see Bill? You are always just one punch away.  

The Set-Up is directed by Robert Wise and stars Robert Ryan & Audrey Totter. The screenplay was adapted by Art Cohn from a 1928 poem written by Joseph Moncure March. The story (played out in real time) sees Ryan as Stoker Thompson, a 35 year old nearly washed up boxer still trundling around the circuit believing he's still got what it takes to become a champ. In spite of pleas from his fretful wife, Julie (Totter), Stoker gets in the ring with Tiger Nelson (Hal Baylor), a man 12 years younger. Unbeknownst to Stoker, though, his manager Tiny (George Tobias) has struck a deal with underworld gangster Little Boy (Alan Baxter on prime sweaty and icy form) for him to take a dive and let Nelson win.

What first struck me the most watching this was just how vile everyone apart from the boxers are. The fighters are actually the only ones with honesty and integrity running through their veins. These guys are the ones with the self respect being a chief issue for them, they are fighting not just for glory, but for a basic human trait. The first half of the film puts us in the boxers changing room as the fighters wait to go out into the ring. Here we see the number of noble pugilists stripped back to reveal either their fears or their blind beliefs - while they in turn wait to see who comes back victorious or defeated. As they chat amongst themselves the atmosphere is palpable and Wise excellently uses cutaways to the excitable and blood thirsty crowd. The impact is to that of a gladiatorial arena and shows the sport to be seedy yet utterly beguiling at the same time.

Then it's on to Stoker's fight where Ryan is terrific (he actually boxed for College for 4 years). Thompson is a character so stand up, yet driven by foolish pride, it puts Stallone's Rocky Balboa firmly in the shade, his whole ""just one punch away"" mantra is truly wonderful and heartfelt and leads to one of those endings that are frustratingly brilliant in its bittersweet closure. The whole fight with Nelson has a beautiful fluidity about it (former pro boxer John Indrisano choreographed it), with Milton R. Krasner's photography keeping it grim and humanistic - both in the ring and out on the darkly lit L.A. streets as Totter's conflicted wife ponders a potential battering for her stoic husband.

Boosted up by a towering performance from Ryan, and dripping with a film noir sense of desolation, The Set-Up is a simple but powerful boxing gem. A film that gets down to the nitty-gritty of the fighters and the seedy people that surround them. 9/10",9.0
17221,"Your job is to detect criminals, not to punish them. 

American city film noir directed by Otto Preminger with the screenplay written by Ben Hecht. The adaptation is from the novel ""Night Cry"" written by William L. Stuart and Joseph LaShelle provides the cinematography for the New York City shoot. It stars Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Bert Freed, Tom Tully & Karl Malden, with support coming from Ruth Donnelly, Craig Stevens & Neville Brand.

Tough New York cop Mark Dixon (Andrews) is constantly in trouble with his superiors for his heavy-handed treatment of suspects. When disaster strikes during an altercation with Ken Paine (Stevens), Dixon chooses an unethical route and attempts to frame a gangster nemesis called Tommy Scalise (Merill). However, things don't go according to plan and not only does Dixon find himself falling in love with Paine's wife, Morgan Taylor-Paine (Tierney), but also that he is now mired in a quagmire investigation which sees Morgan's father, Jiggs (Tully), accused of the crime he himself is responsible for.

Where The Sidewalk Ends was the final film noir piece that Preminger made for 20th Century Fox in the 1940s. Then a director for hire, the film sees Preminger re-teamed with Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney, Joseph LaShelle, Ben Hecht and art director Lyle Wheeler, all of whom produced the excellent ""Laura"" in 1944. Whilst linking the two films together is understandable given the makers and the genre/style involved, the two are very different movies. Which to my mind makes a mockery of some critics looking unfavourably on ""Sidewalk"" because of the regard ""Laura"" is held. ""Sidewalk"" is more grittier, more violent and certainly darker (this is one troubled chip on the shoulder copper), in short this is big city noir and some way away from the socialite leanings of the more glossy ""Laura"".

There's a lot of quality involved here. Preminger astutely paces the story and manages to make Dixon sympathetic, thus fully doing justice to Hecht's tough and tight script that unravels in a world of cop shops, cafés, street side apartments and underworld hang-outs. All of which is given the perfect low-key (almost seedy) photographic treatment by the always visually appealing LaShelle. The cast, too, are doing great work. Tierney is a beguiling beauty throughout, something that works off of Andrews' more chiselled featured and emotionally conflicted portrayal rather well. It's arguably one of Andrews' best & most convincing performances, for Dixon carries around with him much pain and bitterness due to his father having been a criminal. In a perverse bit of writing, Dixon essentially finds himself investigating himself, throw in a burgeoning romance with sharp kickers attached, and, shades of patricide, then it's a character in need of depth. Andrews steps up to the plate and layers it to perfection to give noir one of its finest policeman protagonists. The rest are effective, particularly Malden, Merrill and Brand, the latter of which is the tough guy actor who isn't William Bendix!

If we have to pick flies? Then the ending carriers some Hollywoodisation baggage, and there's some implausibilities within the story. But really neither of those things stop the film from being the riveting offering that it is. So get out on that sidewalk with Dixon and see just what awaits us, and him, after Preminger has taken us for a murky stroll. 8/10",8.0

We know who the culprits are, and we know who did what to whom - what helps this to work well is the way we are invited by Otto Preminger to take a perspective watching how the characters all deduce and find out. It's a violent story in a violent city and in the end you begin to wonder if the end does/did justify the means as the cat and mouse game nears it's lively finale. None of the actors here really stand out, but I think that works better at creating a genuine sense of teamwork (amongst the cops and the gang) and the dialogue is sparing enough to let the frequent action do most of the heavy lifting.

A boy befriends a fiery Arabian stallion in the Mediterranean in 1946 and ends up hooking up with an ex-horse racing trainer (Mickey Rooney) back home in the northeast USA. Teri Garr plays the mother.   

""The Black Stallion"" (1979) starts out like Tarzan’s origin, just substituting the horse for the apes, before switching to the typical sports formula (young underdog’s talent is recognized and trained by an over-the-hill mentor). Thankfully, this is not a Disney kiddie flick; the tone is artistic and mature with the same visual/audio wonder of “The Secret Garden” (1993), both movies produced by Francis Ford Coppola.

While it’s as aesthetically awesome as “The Secret Garden,” it’s not as dramatically engaging. Teri Garr's role is negligible and Rooney’s character isn’t interesting like, say, Mr. Miyagi in “The Karate Kid” (1984) or even Nick Nolte’s ‘Socrates’ in “Peaceful Warrior” (2006). Either Garr’s part needed beefed up or the scriptwriters should’ve added another character to the mix, like a girl who befriends the boy, but SOMETHING to keep things compelling.

As it is, the story is too dull to maintain the interest of most people over 7 years-old. But the stallion is magnificent and I appreciated the relationship between boy & beast, not to mention the excellent post-war era décor and the afore-noted artistic exquisiteness.   

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot in Sardinia, Italy (island sequences), and the Toronto area of Canada, with some stuff done in northwest Oregon (Astoria, Gearhart and Nehalem).

1970 saw the Carry On team begin the decade with one of the better offerings in the franchise. Boosted by the returning Frankie Howerd and Terry Scott to join Messrs James, Hawtrey, Sims, Connor and Bresslaw, Carry On Up The Jungle sticks close to the cheeky formula that had worked in the better series entries previously (think Carry On Up The Kyber from 1968). Originally intended to be called Carry On Tarzan (the idea was scrapped for legal reasons), ""Jungle"" plonks a load of British odd balls in the jungle and invite us to observe how they cope. Which of course we know is not going to be very well at all. Terry Scott steals the film as a blundering Tarzan type (a role apparently turned down by Jim Dale), whilst Howerd and James get maximum humour from their polar opposite characters.

This time around, the diamond wearing Joan Sims' ""Lady Bagley"" is mounting a jungle expedition to see if her long-lost baby really ended up in the belly of a crocodile alongside her husband. Meantime, a loincloth clad Terry Scott is marauding the jungle swinging from tree to tree... Might he be the one? Might she still want to know if he is? This isn't really very good. Howerd dominates with his birdwatching ""Prof. Tinkle"" and he rather subsumes James's dipso expedition leader ""Boosey"", Sims and a rather daft performance from Hawtrey's ""Tonka"" (trucks not chocolate?).

17295,"It's the mid 1950s and the population of Algeria are increasingly determined to break free from the colonial administration of France. From one perspective it's a fight for freedom, from the other a response to dangerous insurrectionism. What makes this drama stand out is the degree of impartiality with which it depicts the story. The French are still licking their wounds after leaving their Indo-Chinese empire and are desperate to avoid another defeat here. The local population are poorly educated and hopelessly outgunned but have the advantage of mobility and surprise as they seek to emulate their Oriental contemporaries. Neither side shies away from acts of brutality and that's depicted poignantly here with anyone in uniform a target for the rebels and any one at all a target by way of response. It has the feel of a docu-drama to it, with the characterisations of ""La Ponte"" (Brahim Hadjadj) and ""Col. Mathieu"" (Jean Martin) acting well as a conduit for both sides of a story that saw losers on every side and tested the humanity of each as any semblance of decency or a code of war went swiftly by the board. It's not just both sides here that are exposed to judgment, but the pretty hapless UN doesn't really come off any better (perhaps restricted by a potential French veto?). The photography and visual effects are very effective at presenting us with a largely urban war zone in which collateral damage was inevitable, and seemingly a price both parties were prepared to pay. The history of the scenario and it's results are fact, but Gillo Pontecorvo uses quite a considerable degree of creativity and sensitivity in demonstrating just how desperate times can result in desperate measures - and maybe even a little grudging respect.

Harrison Ford plays the leader of the operation while Carl Weathers plays a sergeant escaping the MPs, a last minute addition. Barbara Bach and Richard Kiel show up later. 

""Force 10 from Navarone” (1978) is the McDonalds equivalent of the first movie. This doesn’t mean it’s necessarily bad (after all, McDonalds ain’t bad), just that it lacks the class of its predecessor and trades it in for cartoonish writing and loads of action. It’s sort of a mixture of the first film with ""Where Eagles Dare"" (1968) and “Hornets’ Nest” (1970), but with a wildly comic book tone à la “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981), albeit less goofy and not as proficient. The cast is great, though, and the locations are to die for. It’s just that the writing is glaringly juvenile.

Even though it's gargantuan in length, this is actually a ""small"" screen adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway play. Met with indifference by the critics of the time, it has however come to be loved by many a musical fan. I'm not one of them though...

There's no denying that the songs are superb, mostly top draw, but there are so many irritating issues within. The much discussed colour filters that were used by director Joshua Logan and cinematographer Leon Shamroy, are overkill, trying to supplant whimsy when really a static set can't carry the treatment. Pic is easily 45 minutes too long, thus when the war sequences come so late in the play they feel at odds with what has transpired in the previous 2 hours of film.

Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano Brazzi as our loved up lovers are polar opposites on character terms, but also in acting skills. She is radiant for the key musical numbers, but her character away from the musical numbers starts to grate the longer the pic goes on. He, well he's as stiff as one of Logan's camera set-ups is. Even some of the dancing choreography comes off as something that was originally thrown away during production discussions.

There can be no doubt that the songs are memorable, but there is not a jot of chemistry between Brazzi and the increasingly Doris Day-esque Gaynor and the ensemble chorus numbers come across as overly choreographed and not in the least natural. For much of the film, it appears as if it's shot through a telescope with slightly blurred edges. Initially reminiscent of dream sequences, this technique soon loses it's potency and ends up contributing little to this generally rather lacklustre and thinly plotted comic love story.

17360,"Arguably one of the most unfairly derided boys own movies out there.

World War II and the Nazi officers have come up with a propaganda driven idea for the German national football team to play a team composed of Allied Prisoners of War. Led by Capt. John Colby (Michael Caine) the prisoners agree, but there's more than just propaganda at stake here.

Directed by John Huston in the twilight of his career, Escape To Victory, in spite of it being a perennial Bank Holiday staple viewing in the UK, is a film that's often used as a kicking post by stuffy critics. It's hard to understand why such a fun and harmless piece can cause such derision in cinematic circles. It can't be expectation because when you read the plot and see that Sylvester Stallone is playing as the goalkeeper, and that a tubby 48 year old Caine is the captain of this soccer team, well surely you know this film isn't all about about cranial depth encompassing the propaganda machinations of the Nazi regime.

Using real footballers (notably Pelé, Bobby Moore and Osvaldo Ardilies) is what makes Escape To Victory work as entertainment for so many people in the UK. Huston, much like Stallone, hadn't got a clue how to make a football based movie. In stepped the footballers to choreograph the films football sequences - sequences that give the film some truly memorable moments (Pelé overhead kick, Ardiles rainbow flick, and erm, a Stallone penalty save). They couldn't act for toffee, none of them, but that's where Caine comes in. Guiding them through their scenes, Caine was highly thought of on the set by the players, a sort of father figure by all accounts, and not just on the set, but in the bar as well. Stallone excepted (he was off doing his own thing most of the time), it was a happy shoot, and this shines bright in the movie, with the non actors growing in confidence as the movie progresses. So while the film ultimately deals in escapist fun, it's not without moments of poignancy too. A sacrificial break for the war effort induces winces across the board, whilst the arrival of the Eastern Block players from the work camps demands our utmost heartfelt thoughts.

So is Escape To Victory a great film? No, of course not. But it is a darn good one. A film that's easy to lose oneself in during the holiday periods.

Released in 1950, “The Gunfighter” stars Gregory Peck as a middle-aged quick-draw gunfighter who rides into a Southwestern town where his fame excites the populace and attracts young bucks wanting to make a name. Millard Mitchell plays the sheriff, an old friend, while Helen Westcott appears as his former babe. Karl Malden plays the bartender while Jean Parker is on hand as a saloon singer. 

The movie starts great with a saloon confrontation and a chase in the desert wilderness. Too bad the B&W photography renders the awesome locations flat. 

From there the story turns dramatic and it’s done well as we get to learn about the gunfighter through his conversations with peoples he’s known. There are a couple of hokey elements but, for the most part, this is a potent Western drama. I didn’t like the ending though; I think it was a cop-out and something better could’ve been scripted.

Karl Malden is quite good as the barman who shares quite a bit of the accruing danger and as Henry King keeps us interested for just shy of ninety minutes, we are taken on a trip that gradually and effectively builds the sense of imminent peril. Peck is on good form and Homeier also rather good as the youth with the scent of blood and fame in his nostrils.

17421,"So, Duke and Slaughter are sergeants and somehow outrank Lt Falcon who is an officer and not a noncom? I guess they took a page out of Oliver Stone's Platoon.

And, Jinx, well, she was a lot different too wasn't she? And so was Beachhead and Tunnel Rat, who was actually Larry Hama, and, well, the list goes on and on.

17431,"Gerty, we're not programmed. We're people, do you understand?

Directed by Duncan Jones and starring Sam Rockwell, Moon finds Rockwell as Sam Bell who is coming to the end of his three year contract on a lunar station working for Lunar Industries. His only companion is an intelligent computer named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). When Sam has an accident he awakens to find he is now not alone and all he thought and believed in is just not as it seems.

Forget any fears about a low budget and any plot similarity to 2001: A Space Odyssey, for this is a cracker jack of a science fiction picture. Film quickly fills us in on Sam Bell the man and his function up there on the lunar station. His relationship with GERTY the computer grabs our interest whilst the production design has a sort of medicinal sheen to it. Once Sam's solitude is established, the minimal contact with Earth explained, the pic then spins into another dimension, dragging both Sam and us viewers into the vortex.

To say more would be churlish, but this is adult science fiction, clever in existential whiles and scathing with observations on corporate shenanigans. Narratively it's evocative in its telling, even haunting and philosophical, where a brilliant Rockwell nails every inch of Bell's search for being, and crucially, the truth. It's all building towards a finale of some devilish substance, no cop outs or easy fed answers, just a pertinent question asked of the viewers. Moon comes highly recommended to sci-fi fans who are after a bit more than mere sparkly fluff and robotic chaos. 9/10",9.0

Sam Rockwell no only carries the movie, but he's literally the only person in the movie that isn't on a screen.

He plays off himself amazingly well and really balances the struggles of both the individual and the clone to clone interaction.  The struggle feels like how someone would react to the situation, and Rockwell adds his own special flair to it.

The setting of Luna is amazing, granted it's mostly in the small station, but it makes me jealous that we haven't established moon colonies.  Space madness might be a real thing, but it is because someone is alone and not part of a group.

17450,"***Imagination helps endure the harsh realities of the Depression***

In the 1930s a struggling sheet music salesman (Steve Martin) tries to escape his dreary existence with his prudish wife (Jessica Harper) to pursue his dream and a cute schoolmarm (Bernadette Peters). The imaginations of the characters help them deal with the harsh realities of the Great Depression. Vernel Bagneris plays a homeless accordion player while Christopher Walken is on hand as a pimp.

“Pennies from Heaven” (1981) is a drama/musical based on the 1978 British mini-series and written by the same guy. The song & dance routines occur about every 7 minutes and are an amusingly kinetic counterpoint to the sad Depression-era dramatics. Martin is his usual comical self, but the drama is definitely not a comedy and contains some seriously unsavory moments. 

“Pennies from Heaven” was the precursor to musicals like “Chicago” (2002) and “Nine” (2009), but those films have superior reality-based stories and far better women, especially “Chicago” as far as the women go. But Bernadette is a joy to behold as usual; and Martin is charismatic despite playing a man of dubious character.

The movie runs 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot in Illinois (Chicago & Galena) and Southern Cal (the Los Angeles area & Wasco).

Genuinely, the movies my peers in film class were making when I was **fifteen** are better than _The Room_. Before you say it, yes I did watch The Room in a group, and no I didn't enjoy it.

17473,"Brought to us by Wiseau-Films working with Chloe Productions and TPW Films is probably one of the worst films I have seen recently as I have discussed the film with others in my own podcast on Inside Movies Galore and I’m still on the fence whether I actually like the film. I watched this film twice once for my podcast and once for another that is enough and I will probably never watch this film again in my life if I don’t have to.

This is Tommy Wiseau’s debut film from 2003 where he plays a man named Johnny who has a beautiful blonde hair girlfriend named Lisa played by Juliette Danielle whom is actually kind of a bitch. Johnny has a working class job as a banker, takes care of a teenager named Denny, who insists almost on being a peeping Tom on their sex life, comes home to his woman Lisa and over time finds out she is cheating on him with his best friend Mark played by Greg Sestero then offs himself… on a budget of six million how can you film something like this?

Denny a young teenager is not entirely living with Johnny but is more like a son to him is caught up in the mix and gets into trouble with a drug dealer but you also see some kind of turmoil that Mark Goes through as he does feel guilty sleeping with Lisa but he enjoys it but is probably the most annoying actor on the set with his high pitched squeals. Also the fact of Lisa’s friends whom just can’t keep from fucking, started story plots that weren’t entirely needed and felt they were an after thought.

The Music behind the film feels like it should be in one of those older 80’s Canon fairy tales or something like Masterpiece Theater, but also elicit’s the feel of soft core love scenes like that what you would see on HBO after dark when it comes to the passionate scenes between Mark and Johnny. I also feel that when Johnny taped the phone calls Lisa made on one of those old tape machine’s feels slightly dated as this was a film done in 2003. I feel like the balcony scene was the worst scene as when they were up there you could tell that there was a stage wall behind them as the cast was talking as I understand this was called a green room.

Though I love dubbed films in Martial arts type films and Toho productions I think that having the actors and actress’s including Tommy Dub their voices in was absolutely awful, mixed with his geriatrics of getting angry at Lisa, Tommy was annoyingly eccentric, there wasn’t a line in the film that was even remotely original. It’s all been said before but I do have to say are quotable. I feel like I should love this movie but I’ve decided that I do not and only mildly enjoy the film as it is just that bad and even then I’m not sure that enjoyment can be the word decribing how I feel about the film. I don’t understand the reason behind why people enjoy the film but point blank it’s terrible. Terribly edited, basically a film you can probably take to a film class and say here’s what not to do.

I didn’t enjoy watching this film. I watched it for the purpose of discussing it on podcasts. I’ll definitely not recommend it to others either but I will say it paved the way to “the Disaster Artist” which looks like it could be an even better film than this piece of trash. I’m sorry to shit on film growing a cult standing but this was not a good film at all. Sorry ladies and gentlemen. Though I own it you go ahead and enjoy it not me.

As I understand it Tommy Wiseau at least in Greg Sestero’s book had actually not been a nice person to his cast in fact he’d actually been quite abusive so those whom are actually on his side you have to wonder at their sense of morality in believing this film was remotely good. I guess I’d say this was one of those films where Tommy had the money to buy his film haters the ones that find it just that enjoyable to hate movie goers.

I understand that he, Tommy Wiseau, probably took the films he knew growing up which probably had more to do with those soft core roughies you saw at the peepshows after midnight but ladies and gentlemen I’m not into belly porn… Enjoy the film if you must just don’t lie and say it was a great film…

Three positives that I can say about the film is I loved that beginning shot of that cool looking Architecture, The part where the friends have fucked and dude comes back for his underwear and I guess the fact that all the lines are quotable in the same accent that Tommy has.

Of course, the dialogue is abysmal, the sex scenes filmed in an out of focus fashion that we can only ever be truly thankful for, and the soundtrack is so cheesy that the whole thing just engenders audience participation on quite an unprecedented scale. This is garbage; there is no other word for it - yet it is eminently watchable (after three bottles of wine and some i/v gin). Carolyn Minnott is wonderfully earnest as mother ""Claudette"", too.

17473,"A cult classic of ""so bad that it's good"" filmmaking, the story of how The Room was created has become as legendary as the film itself. Watching The Room gave me the impression I was watching a film written and directed by an extra-terrestrial being who'd never seen a movie before, nor seen real humans interact. 

Tommy Wiseau's acting has to be seen to be believed. It is not what one might consider ""good"", to put it mildly. There are way too many boring and cringeworthy sex scenes in this, which definitely drags its rating down. Many aspects of the story and lore are truly baffling, which actually adds to the entertainment value of the film. 

However, I do not find The Room as entertaining as any of Neil Breen's work (Breen is a filmmaker often mentioned for comparison when discussions of Tommy Wiseau as an artist crop up). Despite its flaws, and a harsh critic might say that there's more flaw than film here, The Room still has more entertainment value than many soulless big-budget Hollywood efforts, made with maximum cynicism as money-making machines.",6.0

Body and Soul is directed by Robert Rossen and written by Abraham Polonsky. It stars John Garfield, Lilli Palmer, Hazel Brooks, Anne Revere and William Conrad. Music is by Hugo Friedhofer and cinematography by James Wong Howe.

A talented boxer's career begins to spiral out of control when financial hunger, matters of the heart and a shady promoter begin to take a hold.

Viewing it now, Body and Soul looks to be chock full of boxing movie clichés, which of course wasn't the case back in the 40s. Such as it is with the year of release, it has been honourably inserted into the film noir pantheon. If that's worthy - and many of the noir bible writers seem to think so - is up to the individual viewer to decide, what is apparent though is this is a fine piece of film making regardless of genre or style assignment.

Charlie Davis' (Garfield in a worthy Oscar Nominated performance) descent down a crooked path is certainly noir in plot terms, and it makes for riveting viewing. The screenplay for the time is very choice and worthy, focusing as it does on corruption and violence within the sporting world. The look of the pic is that of realism, Rossen and Howe mixing elegiac beauty with fluent fight sequences (of which there aren't actually many), the monochrome sharp as a left hook.

There's no sentimentality on show, this is stripped bare to show the dark that lurks beneath the cheering crowds and sensational advertisement posters. Pic pulses with the beat of the street, the sweat is from those trying to make a living, all while anti capitalism seeps from every frame. The finale drives home a point - consistent with Rossen in general - and even though pic has a very stage bound core, the craft from all involved ensures it never hurts the dramatic worth. 7.5/10",7.0

When he wins an amateur bout, promoter ""Quinn"" (William Conrad) picks him up and starts him earning a little from his fights.

His new found mentor is ruthless and his friends are gradually marginalised or ignored. Can a tragedy very close those to home open his eyes? This is a great story of grit and determination, of love, loyalty and manipulation and Robert Rossen keeps the pace moving really well. The cast is small, and the story tightly woven around some strong characters and a moral many can easily understand - money being the root of all evil, however well intentioned the earning of it.

It's all watchable enough, this, but I couldn't help thinking that Travolta was just a too under-powered for this role. He has the swagger but not the style nor charisma and when it comes to it, Winger isn't really very impressive either as her character lurches from the feisty to the pathetic somewhat implausibly.

When her father is shot and killed, Mattie Ross is outraged and thirsting for revenge. Seeking out Rooster Cogburn based on his gritty reputation, and aided by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, they head off to find the killer.

It's not bold or foolish to say that John Wayne has not only been in better films, he's also given better performances than his Oscar winning turn here in True Grit. However, few of his fans, or anyone who had watched his career closely, were complaining that the big man collected the pinnacle of acting awards. True Grit is a highly entertaining picture that when all is said and done, is as much about Wayne's image as it is a revenge character driven piece. Suffering with ill health in the twilight of his career, Wayne delivers a warm and humble performance as Cogburn. Eye patch over one eye, Rooster Cogburn is a rapscallion who is impossible to dislike, and that comes down to Wayne and his mannered performance.

True Grit is boosted by the sparky performance of Kim Darby as Mattie Ross, with the chemistry between herself and Wayne warm and honest, and this gives the film its emotional core, with both characters needing each other without even knowing it. It almost wasn't to be for Darby though, Mia Farrow was the preferred choice for Mattie, but Farrow unwisely took advice from a mischievous Robert Mitchum and turned down the part, something she is quoted as saying she regretted for the rest of her career. Faring not so well, though, is Glen Cambell as LaBoeuf, guilty of trying too hard, he just becomes hard to take seriously, and this even in the jovial moments. Robert Duvall lands bad guy duties but doesn't quite get to grips with it, and the rest of the cast are merely making up the numbers. 

Thankfully director Henry Hathaway shoots it just about right, he, along with his excellent cinematographer Lucien Ballard, are framing Wayne and all his iconic being in one loving movie.

There is nothing remotely funny about infidelity, it can wreck lives. Sadly The Other Man is a funny film, though not intentionally.

While to a lesser degree the mixed Whirlpool four years later also cements her status in the corridors of darkness. But an argument can be made for this being her crowning glory, both in terms of her effervescent beauty and of the performance she gives (Oscar nominated). It's not outrageous to say that the film achieves greater heights because of her portrayal as Ellen, a character that is the epitome of the femme fatale. Tierney has this beguiling knack of shifting from charm personified to outright evil in a heart beat - and amazingly as Ellen grows more warped and jealous, Tierney grows ever more sexy. It's not just Cornel Wilde's duped Richard Harland falling into her disturbed web, it's any watching human being with a pulse! Even as the shockingly cold moments unravel, and there are some truly chilling ones for sure, Ellen draws us in with a lusty fascination that's rather unique. 

Credit too must go to Stahl's direction, perhaps a director that unfairly sits in the lounge of the unsung, he weaves his story adroitly, setting up plot roads to keep us intrigued, only to then shift focus back on the dame holding court for characters and viewers alike. Wilde does fine, his mannered approach work works well off of Tierney's show stealing turn while in support we get pretty as a picture Jeanne Crain as the crucial sister character, Ruth Berent, while Vincent Price - elegant as always - does his profession proud in the small but important role of the jilted Quinton. 

Leave Her To Heaven is a must for noir fans, a must for Tierney fans, and definitely a production to get the best out of your High Definition TV. 8.5/10",8.0
17645,"Yikes, talk about an internecine plot! This is certainly a story that requires concentration as the machinations of ""Ellen"" (Gene Tierney) take their toll on just about everyone around her. She meets the young writer ""Richard"" (Cornel Wilde) on a train when he encounters this enigmatic young woman who happens to be reading his latest novel. A whirlwind romance ensues that sees her dump her fianceé, marry ""Richard"" and return to his cottage along with his crippled brother ""Danny"" (Darryl Hickman). The green eyed monster soon rears it's ugly head - ""Ellen"" isn't the sharing type, and when ""Danny"" is inexplicably drowned they move home, she has a miscarriage and then they split up. Still determined, ""Ellen"" plots a dastardly scheme to ensure that his new friend ""Ruth"" (Jeanne Crain) ends up in the electric chair. The plot is sophisticated and presented in a well-paced and intriguing fashion with Wilde, Crain and especially Tierney on top form delivering a tightly written adaptation of Ben Ames Williams' cleverly constructed story of lust, envy and manipulation. It's interesting to see Cornel Wilde take on a more substantial role. He still has that gleam in his eye but he takes to the grittier part of his role convincingly. The always reliable Alfred Newman supplies a score that also chips in well as the denouement is anything but straightforward. Rarely seen nowadays, but certainly well worth sitting down for.",7.0

17654,"Great watch, will watch again, and highly recommended.

This has a wonderfully exciting premise: alien refugees on Terra, how Terrans react and how the aliens react.  The premise, as delivered, has some odd holes in though: it's specified that all of the crew have died, mysteriously, and no one knows how to operate the ship, but it's been in the air for some time.  The idea of gravity alone should have motivated Johannesburg to evacuate, but their government interaction seems decidedly weak.

The advantage of setting the story in South Africa, for an American audience, is that it's a very capitalistic society where they speak chiefly English: it's very similar to being set in Mexico and using Mexican Cartels instead of Nigerian gangs.

So if we accept that we haven't been able to extract an incident report, that we're not able to move the ship, and none of the xenos can move the ship, then the premise includes that one xenos knows what to do.  One would think that he just talks to someone and he gets all his people off planet, but since he's smart enough to do what he's been doing for 20 years, then he knows not to trust anyone.  But this self-serving principle is key to understanding character motivations going forward.

The writing in this is so good, along with the effects, and performance delivery.  As Vickis deals with his transformation, it prompts so many philosophical questions of what it is to be a person / human / xenos, a citizen, a government agent.  It also sort of resembles a gangsta / heist movie at parts, as opposed to a anti-government escapee.

If any of the deep stuff worried you, then be at ease that this movie has plenty of explosions, gunfire and sci-fi goodness.  It's also filled with some silly cliches that serve the points of the story, but there are several points in this movie that I have to shake my head at.  The motivations don't make sense unless you're reminded that everyone, including the protagonists, are (forced) in a self-serving mindset and it's about what they can do for themselves, even when working together with the contrast being, of course, that only when anyone is cooperating that anyone gets anywhere.

This is such a great watch, and if you like sci-fi styled stuff, and don't mind the South African setting (""Chappie"" is another one), then definitely give this a watch.",9.0

I'm not a big fan of films about aliens, so the film won't be my cup of tea at all. However, that didn't stop me from seeing it, and appreciating what's good about it. Without a colossal budget or a powerful studio, director Neill Blomkamp gives us an intelligent and technically impactful film.

In fact, it is in the most technical details that I felt impressed by the film: we have extraordinary cinematography, with magnificent light and colors. The effects and CGI used are very good and prove that you don't need an endless bag of money to get a good result. The ship is strange enough and the aliens are credible enough, with a bizarre but elaborate and well-made appearance, and the way they speak is, at the same time, expressive and enigmatic. Much of the film was filmed in a real South African slum, and it is difficult to see that human beings are still living in such an environment.

The director bet on little-known actors, and this gives some additional credibility to the list of characters that were created here. Sharlto Copley is perhaps the easiest to recognize, as he has worked on some of the most widely circulated productions. Here, he is able to, at least, give us a worthy performance without major flaws... the only colossal flaw is not the actor's fault, but the script's, which gave his character a name very prone to jokes and puns in my mother tongue (I think French and even Spanish speakers will also understand): Wicus van de Merwe.

The film's biggest problem is the weakness of the script. It seems to me that the film attempted a kind of social criticism by placing, instead of human people, strange aliens in that filthy slum. Is the film a sharp criticism of the way we discriminate and segregate those we consider inferior or different from us? If so, I understand, but perhaps I was one of the few to understand. It's the only explanation for the way the film begins: instead of taking sick aliens to a laboratory and spending decades studying them in depth, are we going to put them in a filthy slum? It doesn't make any sense to me.",5.0

17660,"Well, well. So this is Dodge City, huh? Sort of smells like Fort Worth, don't it? 

""Dodge City, Kansas - 1872. Longhorn cattle center of the world and wide-open Babylon of the American frontier - packed with settlers, thieves and gunmen"".

""Dodge City... rolling in wealth from the great Texas trail-herds... the town that knew no ethics but cash and killing"".

Enter trail boss Wade Hatton, cunningly disguised as a dashing Errol Flynn...

Dodge City, an all action Western from start to finish, finds Errol Flynn (in his first Western outing) on tip top form. Based around the story of Wyatt Earp, Michael Curtiz's expensively assembled film charms as much today as it did to audiences back in 1939. All the genre staples are holding the piece together, dastardly villains, pretty gals, wagon train, cattle drive, iron horse, Civil War, shoot outs, fist fights and of course an heroic Sheriff. All neatly folded by the astute and impressive Curtiz. Aided by Sol Polito's fluid Technicolor enhanced photography, and Max Steiner's breezy score, Curtiz's set pieces shine as much as they enthral. A burning runaway train and the finest saloon brawl in cinema are the stand outs, but there are many other high points on which to hang the hat of praise.

Very much a male dominated film, it's with the ladies that Dodge City fails to reach greater heights. Olivia de Havilland, who is always a feast for the eyes in Technicolor, disliked her role as Abbie Irving, and it's not hard to see why. There is not much for her to get her teeth into, it's a simple role that demands nothing other than saying the lines and to look pretty. Ann Sheridan as Ruby Gilman gets the more sparky role, but she sadly doesn't get that much screen time. Which is a shame because what little there is of Sheridan is really rather great.

Those problems aside, it's with the guys where the film  is rightly remembered. Flynn attacks the role of Hatton with gusto and a glint in his eye. When he straps on the Sheriff badge for the first time it's akin to Clark Kent shredding his suit to become Superman. Yes it's that exciting. Bruce Cabot and Victor Jory are growly and great villains, while comedy relief comes in the fine form of side-kickers Alan Hale and Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams. Picture sets out to entertain, and entertain it does. In a year that saw other notable and lauded Westerns also released (Stagecoach, Jesse James and Destry Rides Again) give credit where credit is due, for Dodge City deserves its place amongst those other genre offerings - and most assuredly so as well. 8/10",8.0
17660,"A mediocre western set to be carried by the charisma of its two leading actors.

Root out the bad guys and get the girl is what ""Dodge City"" can be boiled down to. It has many predictable moments that you don't have to be an astute viewer, to see coming. That fact does, however, not make it a drag to watch, which is down to the phenomenal cast.

Olivia de Havilland doesn't get much to do except to stand around and look pretty, which is such a waste of one of the finest actresses the medium ever had. Flynn is charming and charismatic as ever. Alan Hale does a great job as the funny sidekick that you cannot help but adore as the film goes on.

One thing the film itself deserves praise for, is its bar fight, which has to be the nuttiest one I have seen in any western. They go all out, and I can't imagine someone didn't get hurt for real during it.

It's a motion picture mostly for die hard fans of cast members such as Flynn or de Havilland. Other than that, there's not much to it. If you're not the biggest western fan, this surely won't win you over, and western connoisseurs will most likely be bored.",5.0
17667,"Beat Street is an American dramatic musical film directed by Stan Lathan and written by Andrew Davis, David Gilbert, and Paul Golding. The film features a talented cast including Guy Davis, Rae Dawn Chong, Saundra Santiago, Doug E. Fresh, Mary Alice, Shawn Elliott, and the late Duane Jones, known for his role in Night of the Living Dead. Orion Pictures released this film on June 8th, 1984, five months after Breakin' had been released.

The Beat Street Crew looks to put their mark on the South Bronx, and they won't let anything stop them. Ramo is into tagging and is always chasing an elusive, brand-new, all-white subway car. His friend, Lee, wants to make his mark on New York City's breakdancing culture and has been tearing up the floor at local nightclubs. His older brother, Kenny, wants to be a world-famous DJ. This crew has the passion, the skills, and the drive to work hard for what they want.

Beat Street is an awesome look at New York City's hip-hop culture of the 1980s. A perfect call and response to the more cartoonish musical dance films that had come before it, Beat Street is a fuller film about Breakin’ or its sequel. And it has a deeper message. Breakin' was set on the West Coast in Los Angeles and featured a lot of the hip-hop and breakdancing prevalent at the time. However, Beat Street is a star-studded love letter to East Coast hip-hop culture. It's definitely what Roger Ebert was talking about when he said that Breakin' was opening the door for bigger-budget breakdancing movies in the future.

Keeping in tradition with the rest of the movies that I watched for Breakdancing week, Beat Street offered an amazing soundtrack curated and composed by Harry Belafonte Jr. and others. Belafonte's signature Calypso tunes are definitely there, meshing with traditional breakdance beats to create unique sounds and vibes. Many of the songs have that infectious Miami Sound Machine-type sound. Melle Mel, Afrika Bambaataa, Treacherous Three, Doug E. Fresh—these are just a few of the names who appear in the movie. We're definitely going to have a lot of songs to add to the Spotify playlist.

Rae Dawn Chong was fantastic. She's got this energy that just doesn't quit. Guy Davis is cool personified. Robert Taylor is a great dancer and he really makes Lee's character iconic. And those actors were so good in those roles. But they just didn't carry the same weight as the know-it-all, street-smart Graffiti artist Ramo.

John Chardiet's Ramo turned in a killer performance that stole the show for me. He reminded me a lot of Matt Dillon’s character in The Flamingo Kid. Ramo is at that stage in his life where he's becoming a man who understands that he wants his art to be what defines him. His unapproving father, played by Shawn Elliot, just wants him to be a good person and make something of himself. Of course, he misunderstands his son and doesn't identify with Graffiti Art. But towards the end of the picture, his father gets to see some of Ramo's work and he understands. It’s the deepest part of the film and the best.

While the story may not be the strongest, it boasts amazing character development and captures an energy that is almost unmatched. Unfortunately, it doesn't receive the recognition it deserves. There are deeper and more intimate tales that will come out this year, but Beat Street might be one of the best dance/musical films of the year. It feels so real compared to Electric Boogaloo. After watching the movie, a line rang through my mind, “If Art is a Crime, May God Forgive Me.” This was a solid three-and-a-half-star film, but the character work here just puts it over the edge to four stars.",7.0

This show of the documentary is a collection of Orbison's hits at the then Ambassador Hotel's Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles, with the backing band being the TCB Band, which accompanied Elvis Presley from 1969 until his death in 1977: Glen Hardin on piano, James Burton on lead guitar, Jerry Scheff on bass, and Ronnie Tutt on drums. 

Male background vocalists, some of whom also joined in on guitar, electric organ and keyboards were Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne, J.D. Souther and Steven Soles. 

The female background vocalists were k.d. lang, Jennifer Warnes, and Bonnie Raitt. During the end credits, several of the band members are shown talking about how Orbison influenced them.

Barbara Orbison died at 62yo of pancreatic cancer.

The Five Pennies is a musical biopic of jazz great Red Nichols, who is here played by Danny Kaye. As the famed Dixieland cornetist, he runs into opposition to his sound, but breaks through barriers to achieve success. Upon marrying an understanding patient woman (Barbara Bel Geddes) he begins to raise a family. But when tragedy strikes the family, ""Red"" puts down his horn to focus on matters of the heart.

Out of Paramount, The Five Pennies was released at a time when musical biopics were popular. Amazingly, as schmaltzy as the whole thing is on narrative terms, it's amazingly true to fact and and it pays to remember that when you think things are too sugary.

The music positively booms with joy, none more so than when the great Louis Armstrong is involved in duets with Red (the real Nichols playing). Tuesday Weld plays the teenage Nichols daughter and she is an utter delight, where she hits all the right emotional beats as the character progresses. Kaye is in his element, a perfect piece of casting, and Geddes is the embodiment of Americana wives of stoic firm and loyal beliefs.

It's a musical biopic that isn't afraid to show the main protag as a flawed individual, and that should be applauded.

I look back on <em>'The Five Pennies'</em> in two parts.

By the end, I felt truly attached to the characters and their story - but that feels weird, given how I didn't enjoy the early stages.

Danny Kaye is very good in the lead role of Red, especially towards the end. Susan Gordon (Dorothy, as a kid) impressed me a bunch, she has one fantastic poker scene with Kaye. Barbara Bel Geddes, meanwhile, plays the role of Willa well.

The film, a loose biopic on the real Red Nichols, is music-heavy. Early on I think that affects things from a film point of view, but you can at least tell the cast - particularly Kaye and Louis Armstrong (as himself) - are having a fun time.

Plot follows the shenanigans of two rivals played by Sinatra and Martin who have designs on a waterside casino. Bandido Charles Bronson is on their tails while Ekberg and Andress file in for romantic interests.

Aldrich disliked the film (the director famously couldn't get on with Sinatra), its reputation is decidedly lukewarm and The Three Stooges make an embarrassingly pointless cameo, 4 for Texas is a distinctly average comedy/western. The star power keeps it watchable, with rat packers Deano and Frank constantly trying to score machismo points - Ekberg & Andress lighting up the screen with natural beauty - Bronson in solid villain role, and it's pleasingly photographed by Laszlo. Yet it's a mundane screenplay and the run time needed to be cut by at least half an hour.

Two carefree teenage girls are jailed in Thailand for allegedly smuggling Heroin while on vacation.

It has become the stuff of reality nightmares, seemingly every year there is the reports of foreigners abroad caught smuggling drugs. Quite often the innocence is starkly protested, claims of being duped or threatened into being drug mules through customs borders. Brokedown Palace is an interpretation of one such instance.

There's a viable complaint about the film that it condenses the harsh realities of the surroundings, this ""Brokedown Palace"" is not portrayed as the dirty hell holes they so often are in reality. This initially gives the film a sort of false feel, that we are being fed a watered down Hollywood production of something very serious.

However, looking deeper into the picture as a character piece, Jonathan Kaplan's film beats a mighty heart and has brain staying power as well. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale (both superb) are the two friends at the centre of this mystery. Story is more concerned with how their friendship copes under the trying circumstances. Through the initial shock of their situation, to the faux trial, the interactions with others and the relationship they have with their American lawyer, Hank the Yank (Bill Pullman). There's also the not small matter that one of the girls might actually be guilty as charged? Which really gives the piece an intriguing kick.

Unfortunately it falls down in other areas. How come the girls are perfectly coiffured? Quite often splendidly attired in cosmetics? As Kaplan strains for authenticity in human interactions, he loses credibility elsewhere because these two girls look like actors who have had a ""don't make me look ugly"" clause inserted into their contracts. Ultimately when the story is dialled into the two girls and their friendship, Brokedown Palace hits the heights required, elsewhere it's a disappointment and it's not hard to understand why the two lead actresses practically disowned the film shortly after their publicity commitments were over. 6/10",6.0

I doubt that this prestigious corporation took too kindly to the unwanted publicity, but these considerations aside, and that slight sense of arrogant US superiority over its northern neighbor, the film is simply not funny.

The best that this film has to give us is the quality of the actors, starting with Brendan Fraser. The actor commits himself, does what he can, but doesn't have decent material to work with. Sara Jessica Parker also does an enjoyable job playing the idiotic hero's dorky girlfriend, and Alfred Molina is just as good. The problem is that the actors, regardless of the effort and individual commitment, received miserable material from the screenwriter, who instead of giving a competent script, delivered a miserable and amateur sketch.

Narrative is two fold, one strand follows soldiers as they strive to make it through perilous lands to get to the beaches, the other comes from the civilian angle and those back in Britain, where there's an ignorance about how seismic this war is going to be. While the film is hardly a rousing battle laden spectacle - it's more an appreciation of a critical moment in history - it's very authentic in its teaching, the various human interest stories and their respective emotions are absorbing and always attention holding.

Absolutely a must see piece of cinema for anyone who needs to understand just why the evacuation of troops from Dunkirk was so important. Superbly played by the cast, directed with safe hands and produced with class by the brilliant Michael Balcon, Dunkirk 58 a smart bit of classic war cinema. 8/10",8.0
17720,"This is an excellent war movie, especially considering it is from 1958. It has aged well. Today’s war movies are more visually impressive, of course, with the special effects that make it seem like you are witnessing the real thing. This version can’t match all that, but except for setting it up politically with newsreel clips and people discussing the “phony” war, this film shows the personal journey of Dunkirk. The home front, soldiers caught behind the rapidly shifting line of battle, and later on the masses of soldiers on the beaches waiting for the civilian “navy” who lent their boats and themselves to the impossible task of getting the trapped army back home to England.

The voiceover narration seemed unnecessary at times. I felt they should just get out of the way and show this human side of the battle of Dunkirk, which could have been a massacre but was instead a stunning rescue operation. We almost expect our war movies to be three-hour spectacles these days, and they are visually impressive, but I still appreciate movies like this one, which balance realistic small-scale warfare scenes with scenes depicting the human interest stories of war.",8.0

The Bedford Incident is directed by James B. Harris and is adapted by James Poe from the 1963 book by Mark Rascovich. It stars Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier, with Widmark co-producing. The cast also features James McArthur, Martin Balsam, Wally Cox and Eric Portman, as well as early appearances by Donald Sutherland and Ed Bishop.

The story is set during the Cold War and focuses on the captain and crew of the USS Bedford as it patrols the North Atlantic waters for Russian submarine activities. Capt. Eric Findlander (Widmark) is a tough authoritarian figure who drives his crew hard and keeps them ever ready for any sort of incidents that may arise. They respond loyally to his ethics, this is a crew where nobody ever goes on sick call such is the hard approach instilled in them by their captain. Two newcomers have boarded the ship by helicopter: Ben Munceford (Poitier), a liberal newspaper journalist, assigned to write a story about the Bedford and its grizzled captain and a ship's doctor, Lieut. Comdr. Chester Potter (Balsam), a reserve officer who has volunteered for active duty. Both men are quickly disliked by Findlander, he sees their being there as intrusive and upsetting the tough equilibrium of his ship. When a Russian sub is spotted unlawfully in Greenland's territorial icy waters, Finlander stalks it ready to take action. But the top brass doesn't want a perilous situation arising between the two nuclear powered ships and orders Finlander to sit tight, something he is unable to comprehend and intends to do things his own way. With his hard driven crew at breaking point, this could turn into a catastrophic incident...

Taut, tense and impeccably acted by the cast, The Bedford Incident is a superior psycho-drama that feeds off of the paranoia of the Cold War and cloaks it in military claustrophobia. It offers up the dangers of military aggression fuelled by some sense of patriotic duty, with an intriguing ""hunt till we drop"" iron fist ethic making for an engrossing narrative thread. The film of course is not alone in the ""doomsday"" scheme of things, even the previous year had seen the release of Sidney Lumet's Fail-Safe and Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove (a link here coming courtesy of James B. Harris having been Kubrick's producer for almost ten years), but Harris' movie is more than the equal of any other film with the same thematics. The box office returns for the film at the time didn't do it justice, but time has been kind to the movie. For now it can be viewed as a lesson in jangling the nerves, a reference point in how to script polar opposite characters; thriving on dialogue set in amongst murky military zeal and an unstable political environment. Now more than ever the film serves as a cautionary tale. Tho there's some differences from the book, the film follows the novel fairly closely. However, the big change comes with the ending. I don't consider it hyperbole to suggest that the ending to the film is stunning. A fitting closure to the piece and the ultimate release from the stifling grip that the makers had held the viewers in throughout the story. Shot in stark black and white by Gilbert Taylor and with Widmark at the top of his game, The Bedford Incident is a must see for the serious War movie fan. 8/10",8.0
17744,"There is something of the ""Enemy Below"" (1957) in this tautly directed naval cat and mouse thriller. Richard Widmark (""Finlander"") is captain of the USS ""Bedford"" an American destroyer that is on the tail of a Soviet submarine caught in it's territorial waters. What ensues now is tense and nerve-wracking as the captain must play his dangerous game under the scrutiny of journalist ""Munceford"" (Sidney Poitier) and an observing German Commodore - and former U-boat commander - (Eric Portman), keeping his ship on maximum readiness as the his crew and his officers start to fray a bit round the edges. Widmark is good in this, less so Poitier - his part is maybe just too restricted by the environment and his dialogue isn't great, but Portman offers a sagely foil and a solid supporting cast including Martin Balsam in one of his best roles, manage to help convey the increasing sense of menace as we soon realise that the simplest of mistakes will cost lives. The location - amongst the ice floes, adds well to the suspense too - and the photography encapsulates that to great effect.

As much as I thought I would enjoy getting in the way back machine to see Christopher Lloyd getting up to whacky antics, this was disappointing.

It's a bunch of rich, spoiled kids tricking their parents into paying for what they is a way to get rid of their kids for the summer, and the kids basically creating a criminal ring to facilitate it.

I see a lot similarities between this and ""Accepted"", but where ""Accepted"" was built with better intentions by the characters who were adults that ended up dealing with a situation and turning it to be an attempt at betterment, ""Camp Nowhere"" grew the conspirators first and then committed to a fake camp.

This movie just doesn't have the fun charm that its future counterpart has, and that can probably be attributed to the child actors involved.  They're not all so bad, but they're mostly typical child actors.

Tim Thomerson is the Sarge in charge of a squad during WWII in Europe. His men are ambushed and only three others survive: Timothy Van Patten, Art LaFleur, and Biff Manard. Van Patten is an aw-shuckser who reads pulp sci-fi comics. LaFleur is the tough corporal, and Manard is the combat reporter. The group knows they are behind enemy lines, but they do not know where because all of their compasses are out of whack, due to some strange happenings in the nearby forest. LaFleur and Manard are captured by the Nazis and discover an alien as their fellow prisoner. At the same time, Thomerson and Van Patten stumble upon a crashed space ship. Thomerson destroys the craft, they rescue their comrades, and the five now try to get the alien home. A group of aliens lands to get their own back, but refuse to help our soldiers, who are being chased by the Germans.

The film is less than an hour and a half, but it still feels padded by about twenty minutes. The alien they find looks nothing like its rescuers, which made me think they were going to drag in a subplot about warring alien sides as well...no such luck. The four leads are immensely likable, and you find yourself cheering for them. The film makers take themselves a little too seriously, but make up for it with the cast and very good filming locations.

A special mention about the special effects: they suck. The creature effects are awful, as are anything involving the aliens' weapons, which deteriorate down to weak glowing animation. The only impressive effect comes from the set department, who build a huge crashed space ship that looks big and is totally convincing. Also, listen for Richard Band's musical score, which sounds suspiciously like a few bars from the themes in ""Star Wars.""

Assault on Precinct 13 is written, directed, edited and musically scored by John Carpenter. It stars Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer, Martin West, Tony Burton, Charles Cyphers and Nancy Kyes. Cinematography is by Douglas Knapp.

If you are going to homage films that you love, or ones that influence you, then you have to get it right. Something John Carpenter most assuredly did with this, his first masterpiece. Plot and structure of film are simplicity extreme, but it's the execution that matters here, the cool veneer of the hero characters, the frightening relentlessness of the gang members who assault the soon to close down police station and the small number of inhabitants within. Interestingly it's actually Precinct 9, Division 13, but Carpenter was no doubt in a playful mood.

Carpenter builds the first half slowly, introducing key characters whilst deftly staging the events that will lead to the actual siege itself. This part of Los Angeles where the story is set is conspicuous by how empty and soulless it seems, even in daylight, which is where the terror actually begins. It's as if residents and locals just prefer to be off the streets at any time of day or night. 

The gang, like the folk inside the station, are multiracial, but unlike those inside the gang never speak. They move like silent assassins, no shouting or cussing, just a tidal wave of death, their guns adorned with silencers, which leads to a truly brilliant extended sequence as the gang begin to destroy the building silently! Meanwhile relationships are being formed by those under duress, convicts and police forced to battle side by side in the slightest hope of surviving the night.

There is no flab on show here, no pointless dialogue or scenes which could have been cut, it's a film that is very much to the point. The cast respond well to Carpenter's requirements, be it emotionally, physically or coolly, all while Carpenter's low tone synthesiser plays out its memorably eerie beats. It's a superb lesson in low budget film making from one of the masters of that art. His filmic star may have waned in his later life, but for a time in the 70s and 80s he shone bright, Assault On Precinct 13 was the ignition. 10/10",10.0
17818,"This town looks as if it's full of men who step on baby chickens.

San Antonio is directed by David Butler and written by Alan Le May and W. R. Burnett. It stars Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Paul Kelly, S.Z. Sakall, Florence Bates and Victor Francen. Music is by Max Steiner and cinematography by Bert Glennon.

It's always interesting to compare Errol Flynn's Westerns, his work in a genre he was not overly fond of. Depending on your Western genre proclivities of course, there's a mix of the old fashioned type, where Errol flirts and is heroic, or the more serious ones where his heroism is underplayed. San Antonio is the former.

Plot has Flynn as Clay Hardin, who is the man who can prove that town impresario Roy Stuart (Kelly) is the man responsible for the rampant cattle rustling going on in the state. There's agendas gnawing away in the plot, romantic dalliances that bring the delightful Alexis Smith into prominence, and of course there's frothy comedy light relief - the proviso here is if Sakall and Bates' thing doesn't irritate you?

Flynn is ace, athletic with a handsomeness that's rarely been bettered in Hollywood, to which here he's on lovable rascal form, playing off of Smith with appealing skill. Smith is a strong foil for her leading man, holding her end up in both stern characteristics and comedy angles. While it's always great to find Kelly in a villain role, here getting his teeth into it for much viewing reward.

Unfortunately this really could have done with a better director, the blend of drama and comedy seemingly uneasy in Butler's hands. The big denouement between hero and villain is a damp squib, which is a shame as we are in the ruins of The Alamo, a poignant piece of architecture that positively demands a more extended and vigorous finale. Elsewhere, Glennon's photography is pleasing if lacking in exterior splendours, and Steiner's score will sound familiar to anyone already familiar with his work.

Gloriously pretty, vibrant and colourful, it's well weighted with good production values and a solid cast, but as fun as it is it does lack some urgency ingredients to be great. 7/10",7.0
17829,"After two minutes you will spot the obvious similarity with ""Ball of Fire"" (1941). Swap Gary Cooper with Danny Kaye and Barbara Stanwyck with Virginia Mayo then add some fantastic musicianship from the likes of Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Louis Armstrong, Sonny Burke et al, and we have a gently amusing story of a professor (of music this time) who falls for the gangster's moll. ""Honey"" (Mayo) takes refuge from the pursuing FBI with a bunch of dithery professors creating an over budget dictionary of music and soon the hapless ""Prof. Frisbee"" (Kaye) is eating out of her hand. The gangster elements of the plot are just a little too contrived: her boyfriend ""Crow"" (Steve Cochran) maintains this new situation to keep her from testifying against him - until, that is - he can make arrangements to marry her, but in the meantime might she start to fall for poor old ""Frisbee""? Neither lead are on great form here, Kaye seems oddly distracted from his role and Mayo always was quite a sterile performer, but there is still enough chemistry between them and, alongside a fun effort from Esther Dale as their somewhat puritanical housekeeper ""Miss Bragg"" this works ok. Essentially, it's an excuse for some great toe-tappers with a gently simmering romance and some slightly slapstick humour.

An Atlantean barbarian (Kevin Sorbo) takes the throne of Valusia when he defeats King Borna (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and so General Taligaro (Thomas Ian Griffith) & assorted “noble-blooded” men conspire to overthrow Kull by resurrecting the wicked Acheron sorceress Akivasha (Tia Carrere). Karina Lombard plays Kull’s love interest, Zareta, while Litefoot is on hand as the priest Ascalante.

Released in 1997, thirteen years after the last Conan movie, “Kull the Conqueror” was intended to be the third Conan film, but Schwarzenegger declined so they morphed it into a Kull movie. For those not in the know, Kull was author Robert E. Howard’s other barbarian hero, who wasn’t as popular as Conan. Kull, incidentally, existed thousands of years before Conan’s Hyborian Age. The switch didn’t really matter because the script was loosely based on Howard’s Conan story ""The Phoenix on the Sword,"" which was a rewrite of the Kull yarn “By this Axe I Rule.”

Sorbo was in his prime here and definitely looks like Kull from the comics, except he has his characteristic geniality whereas Kull was more grim and brooding in Howard’s tales. Nevertheless, Sorbo is well cast and one of the film’s highlights.

The score by Joel Goldsmith is quite good, except for a couple of semi-cheesy metal riffs, like the eye-rolling riff near the beginning and another one much later during the fight at the ice cave, which isn’t as bad. At least half of the score lacks any metal guitar whatsoever and most of the pieces that do include it are very good; there’s just a couple of dubious riffs, which turned me off the first time I watched the movie. These wannabe metal rhythms were rather lame in 1997, let alone today.

Another flaw is that the opening of the movie is weak with Kull’s dealings with the Dragon Legion and his fiery sword fight with Taligaro. If you’re patient, however, the story takes a compelling turn with the palace confrontation. The production is acceptable, but noticeably inferior to “Conan the Destroyer” (1984). I’d say it’s on par with “The Sword and the Sorcerer” (1982), but with a superior story and more interesting characters (once you get past the lousy opening). I should add that Tia looks great as a green-eyed redhead and the fiery demon F/X at the close are quite effective.

IF you can handle its obvious shortcomings, “Kull the Conqueror” is an entertaining S&S flick that should be enjoyed by fans of Conan, Sinbad and the like. If you watched it before and didn’t like it, give it a second chance. I’m glad I did. It’s flawed, but there’s too much to appreciate to give it a negative rating.

Set in a 1984 UK industrial-suburbia, as the cold war gets hot, we follow regular people in their daily lives and how they prepare for the coming apocalypse.

Barry Hines and Mick Jackson explains and shows us how the world is interconnected and woven together, each strand in this web is dependent on the others and when the threads start to break, the webbing that hold society together, unravel and we are quickly left with hardship and irreparable loss.

There is no help from the outside, as most places are left in the same sorry state.

With the lingering pollution from the war, there is only one way human kind can go from there.

This film has no high-notes and there are no cheesy Hollywood-lines to comfort you during the viewing, just cold-hard facts and statistic. 

When the inevitable starts, we follow Ruth in particular, the main character, on her journey, 13 years into the future. We see how she tries to cope, as the remnants of the industrial world and human kind slowly crumble and whither around her.

The film use simple effects and has a natural gritty style. 
This prevents the film from looking too dated. In addition, most of the film work with limited sets and scenes, so the time-period it is shot in, is somewhat removed from the story and experience. 

The acting is real and very good, they are real people, playing real people, 'no time for plastic Hollywood-figures here'.

What we are left with, is most likely one of the bleakest, grimmest and most depressing film, that everyone needs to see at least once.

Virginia City is directed by Michael Curtiz and written by Robert Buckner. It stars Errol Flynn, Randolph Scott, Miriam Hopkins, Humphrey Bogart, Alan Hale and Guinn Williams. Music is by Max Steiner and cinematography by Sol Polito.
​
Story is a loose working of actual events that happened in December 1864 at the tail end of the American Civil War. A group of Confederate sympathisers are trying to ship a substantial amount of gold out of Virginia City to rebel leader Jefferson Davis, where it is hoped that the course of the war that the Confederates are close to losing will now be changed...​
​
It was a messy production, not very many people got on, the pic started without a finished script, and with the bad weather mixing with bad blood it was something of a chore for many of the cast. Add in that the great Bogart is woefully miscast - and he knows it - then you got a picture that considering the talent involved across the board is a long way away from being a genre classic.​
​
It starts off so promisingly, we are thrust into the murky confines of Libby Prison - The Black Hole Of The Confederacy (AKA: The Devil's Warehouse), where the ever splendidly twinkled Flynn is burrowing out through a tunnel with his two comedy sidekicks, Hale and Williams. Before you know it they are to be confronted by that bastion of Western/Southern film greatness, Randolph Scott, this is classic film fan nirvana. Sadly it's a false dawn that precedes a film of great moments cobbled together to almost outstay its welcome.

However, such as it is that a love of classic film can keep one engaged for escapist fare value, so it be here. Curtiz at least keeps things brisk enough with a number of action sequences, where we at times find the genius that is stuntman Yakima Canutt at the core of things. Some stunts here beggar belief, including one involving a horse that the ASPCA must have raged at! The stars hold court for their scenes - well except for Bogart trying to munch his way through a Mexican bandit accent and Hopkins out of tone the for the singing sequences , while as fluffy as it is the ending has a warm glow to it. Which leaves what?

It's not the disaster it could have been given the behind the scenes problems, and for sure a love of the era of film making it comes from ensures you have to give it props (it was popular on release). But this could have easily have had twenty minutes shaved from its excess, for then it might have spared an unhappy cast and an expectant audience the sense of disappointment it isn't top line stuff. 6/10",6.0

He's an actor called Lawrence Pressmann and he's not delivering his own painfully garnered research, but an hybrid of that of others. That gimmick doesn't really matter, though, as once this docu-drama gets under way, it's turns into a well photographed investigation into just how easily insects could take over from mankind as the dominant species on Earth. The narration is a bit over the top, alarmist, you might even say but the imagery displayed - especially of the close ups of the menacing features so readily fodder for the sci-fi and horror film industries, is quite effective. These creatures morph from the most unlikely and ugly looking entities into the most beautiful; they work and live in massive swarms and hives existing in concert with nature peacefully pollinating whilst at the same time they can wield enormously potent destructive power. They can be hugely loyal and equally cruel - mating then eating your partner always seems a tad brutal to me (however bad it was!). It lingers briefly on the role of plants in managing their ambitions - some Venus fly traps amongst those quite capable of luring and devouring. Essentially, this illustrates that these animals can be poisonous and/or just hungry, exist in ginormous quantities and the thrust of the narrative is that if they were ever to turn their attentions to mankind, then we'd be ill-equipped to fend them off.

Law is handsome enough, Munro brings a bit of glamour, Baker hams up nicely as the baddie and Christian and Martin Shaw contribute a little bit of nautical humour and theatrical guffawing to the proceedings nicely, too. The real stars, as ever though, are the creations of Ray Harryhausen - not least the Centaur and the wonderful Kali with her sword dance.

17898,"Quaint comic book werewolf flick by Stephen King

RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Daniel Attias, ""Silver Bullet"" chronicles events in a small town in Eastern America when a ferocious werewolf starts picking people off one-by-one. Corey Haim and Megan Follows play the adolescent brother/sister protagonists, the boy being a paraplegic. Gary Busey appears as the amiable alcoholic uncle while Robin Groves plays the mother. Everett McGill is on hand as a prominent minister while Terry O'Quinn appears as the sheriff.

Stephen King wrote both the novella and the screenplay and so the movie has the comic book vibe of movies based on King’s works. The townspeople are unsurprisingly cartoonish, but the main family is well done, i.e. realistic. In any case, “Silver Bullet” seems quaint compared to the three werewolf flicks of 1981: “The Howling,” “An American Werewolf in London” and “Wolfen” (of course the latter wasn’t strictly a werewolf flick, if at all). Nevertheless, I appreciate the old fashioned take on the subject and the warmth of the family members. The werewolf is Grade B when fully revealed, but certainly formidable. 

The film conveys cinematic stereotypes, like the goodhearted drunk (or prostitute) and the corrupt civic leader, who puts on a fake smile for the community while being a savage beast within. Although there’s some truth to these depictions, most of the time a drunkard is an alcoholic because his/her heart is desperately flawed. And the bulk of respected community leaders aren’t evil incarnate. Yet I like the way the movie shows how everything is not necessarily as it appears.            

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in North Carolina (Burgaw, Leland, Wilmington, Castle Hayne and Carolina Beach).

Warning: Spoilers
 
Silver Bullet is directed by Daniel Attias and adapted for the screen by Stephen King from his own novelette ""Cycle Of The Werewolf"". It stars Gary Busey, Corey Haim, Megan Follows, Everett McGill & Terry O'Quinn. The film is set in the small rural town of Tarker's Mills, Maine, which falls prey to a series of grizzly murders. At first the killings are believed to be the work of a mad man, with the town ready to take up vigilante arms against the perpetrator, but young wheelchair bound Marty (Haim) is convinced something more lupine like is responsible.

As most folks know, Stephen King's adaptations to screen are a mixed bunch. Some have been tackled by top line directors such as Kubrick, De Palma, Cronenberg, Reiner & Darabont, while others have been turned out by no marks where the quality befits the low production value. Silver Bullet falls somewhere in the middle on the quality list of King adapted movies. Its reputation is somewhat Luke warm, and whilst it's a little understandable when put up against other 1980's film's in the werewolf pantheon (An American Werewolf In London, The Howling & The Company Of Wolves), it does have a high entertainment value. Of note, too, is that it's not shy in the dark department either. There's mutilated children, a pregnant woman tore to shreds, car attack on our crippled hero, while some of the characterisations are also interesting - such as an alcoholic uncle (a wonderfully OTT Busey) & the mean hick bar dwellers who raise the spectre of vigilantism.

True, the film is also dotted with cheese, but there's fun in that too. I don't know if some of the laughs were intentional or not, but I like to think so. How else can you react to a werewolf that takes up a baseball bat to fell one of his attackers? That's surely meant to be funny, no? It is also not taxing of the brain to work out who the hairy beast is in human form, because, like, the makers gives us the clues. I really don't think they were trying to spring a big surprise on us. Cast wise it's the usual array of mixed performers. Haim is likable, particularly in the scenes with the afore mentioned Busey, O'Quinn adds professionalism, while McGill is always value for money when playing important members of the community. Tis fun too seeing future ""Reservoir Dog"" leader Lawrence Tierney putting his gruff stamp over the bar room proceedings.

So not one for the technical and artistry seeking purists then, but definitely one for those looking for a good bit of werewolf tear em' up that comes with a tasty slice of 1980s cheese. 7/10",7.0

17907,"The Raven succeeded in 1935 where Roger Corman and Vincent Price failed 28 years later. The 1963 version of The Raven was written by Richard Matheson, who is quoted by Wikipedia as saying, ""After hearing that they wanted to make a movie out of a poem, I felt it was a total joke, so comedy was the only way to do it.""

Matheson's mistake was precisely that he approached the material lightly, though; it's because Raven '35 takes itself deathly seriously — director Lew Landerss and screenwriter David Boehm are more popish than the Pope (or, in this case, more Poe-pish than Poe) — that the film transcends the horror genre and enters, albeit unwittingly, the realm of (self) parody.

Consider this: early in the film the characters attend a dance recital entitled ""The Spirit of Poe,"" in which a dancer performs a choreography while we listen to the titular poem over a musical background and see, on one side of the stage, the author in the process of capturing his masterpiece on paper. ""The Spirit of Poe"" would not be out of place in The Tall Guy, in which Jeff Goldblum had the title role in a satirical musical about the Elephant Man called ""Elephant!""

Among the spectators is the morbid Dr. Vollin (Bela Lugosi), who is not only obsessed with Edgar Allan, but also has a personal interest in ballerina Jean Thatcher (Irene Ware); Vollin reluctantly operated on Jean after a car accident, and only after her father, Judge Thatcher (Samuel S. Hinds), assured him that all other doctors agreed that he was the only one who can save her — and save her he does, falling in love with her in the process.

The Judge is grateful but not that grateful, and understandably not wanting the saturnine Vollin for a son-in-law, tries to put a stop to the matter, in turn leading Vollin to hatch a nefarious plot against the Thatchers, with the unexpected but timely help of the fugitive murderer Edmond Bateman (Boris Karloff). This Bateman is, to borrow Grampa Simpson’s expression, dumb as a mule and twice as ugly.

Bateman bursts into Vollin's office demanding that the former surgically readjust his face so he can live in anonymity. Perhaps knowing that the doctor likes to play hard to get, Bateman threatens him with a firearm.

I’m reminded of Eminem's song ""Stan,"" wherein the title character records a message to Slim just before he drives off into a river, logically but belatedly wondering, ""Shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?""

Similarly, Bateman's plan to force the doctor to operate on him at gunpoint has only one small flaw known as 'anesthesia' — and sure enough, Vollin not only relieves Bateman of the gun, but also paralyzes the right side of his face, promising to fix the stroke victim look he's given him if Bateman does the doctor’s bidding (to say that Karloff's makeup is crude is an understatement; rather than made-up, his face looks drawn on.

Vollin invites, among others, Jean, her fiancee, Jerry, and the Judge to a soirée at his mansion — furnished with so many trapdoors, secret passageways, and dungeons that it could have been designed by H. H. Holmes —, introducing Bateman as his servant; although not exactly what he expected, Bateman's new features do serve the purpose of making him unrecognizable (if only the doctor didn't insist on calling him by his real name out loud).

To make a long story short, Bateman subdues the Judge, whom Vollin attaches to a replica of the pendulum from ""The Pit and the Pendulum""; additionally, he locks Jean and Jerry in ""the room where the walls meet.""

For someone with an ""extraordinary interest in Poe,"" Vollin's knowledge of the Bostonian author comes too close to what Lovecraft called ""secondhand erudition."" The doctor knows The Raven by heart, but he recites it like a schoolboy who has learned his lesson without understanding it; moreover, his interpretation of the poem is literal: according to him, Poe fell in love with a certain Lenore and lost his mind when “someone took her from him” (if the Lenore of the poem had a real-life counterpart, it was most likely Poe's mother or his wife Virginia; the consensus is that he had a more brotherly than romantic relationship with the latter).

As for the pendulum, if Vollin had bothered to read Poe’s tale all the way through, he would know the device is more trouble than it’s worth (to be fair, it’s pretty much a given that the good doctor is a few cards short of a full deck, and in that sense it would be a little too much to ask for a method to his madness).",3.0
17909,"An old bus, owned by ""Krstic & son"" is heading from unnamed province to the capital Belgrade, just one day before Nazis attacked Yugoslavia in april 1941. 
The writer Dusan Kovacevic stated that this story was inspired by true events and real people. They all had their reasons why they needed to get to Belgrade as soon as possible, not knowing that their destiny was uncertain.
And their stories and characters get twisted together in a series of events that make you laugh in disbelief.
This comedy and drama is so popular in all of ex Yugoslavia, that even young people know the most of dialogs from this movie by heart. They have become the part of the popular culture. Dusan Kovacevic manages to make those characters so real and alive. The cast is the first class, all of the actors come from the best theaters in the country. 
No use to tell the story and spoil the joy of watching. Just to tell how good it is: the play is staged in theaters around the country for more than 30 years! 

I will not waste time trying to explain technical details, photography, etc. since I am not an expert for that. When one watches the movie, all it matters is do you get bored during the show at any point? Not with this one! And the feeling you get after: do you get excited? Do you want to watch it again? Oh, yes!
It is funny, interesting, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You will see that different cultures are not so different and that destiny can play tricks with everyone and everywhere.

17909,"<i>Ko to tamo peva?</i> is one of Yugoslavia's film classics. It was shot and released in 1980, but it looks back to a tragic era in the country's history: the opening titles announce that what we will see takes place on 5 April 1941, a date that any Yugoslav at this time would recognize as the day before the German invasion. In a non-descript countryside, a bus stops for a motley crew of passengers all headed for Belgrade. They include a grizzled old WWI veteran (Milivoje ""Mića"" Tomic), a dandy hoping to audition at a caberet (Dragan Nikolic), a germanophile who may well be a spy (Bata Stojković), and a newlywed couple (Slavko Stimac, Neda Arneric). Also on board are two gypsies (Miodrag and Nenad Kostić) who periodically comment on the action in funny musical interludes. Driving the bus is cranky and sly old man Kstic (Pavle Vuisic) and his manchild son Misko (Aleksandar Bercek).

So much of the Yugoslav cinema tradition up to this point had consisted of state-approved World War II films repeatedly underscoring how the brave Yugoslav Partisans beat the Germans through every patriotic Yugoslav banding together regardless of their backgrounds and differences. <i>Ko to tamo peva?</i> upsets this tradition, depicting its cast as a squabbling bunch of cantankerous, greedy, and venial types, every man for himself. Yet, in spite of their dislike for one another, the Serb passengers manage to join together at least to beat up the gypsies. (This is a grim counterpart of the old joke popular in the USSR that ""friendship of peoples"" -- one of the values proclaimed by the Communist Party -- refers to when e.g. Russians and Georgians join together to beat up some third ethnicity.)

As the bus makes its way to the big city, the passengers encounter a series of absurd obstacles a la William Faulkner's novel <i>As I Lay Dying</i>: a funeral, the bus driver's impromptu barbecue, and the Yugoslav army detaining them as suspected spies. It seems like they will never reach Belgrade. But when they do finally make it to the capital, the audience has a surprise in store.

The extremely high rating given to this film is mainly due to Serbs and other former Yugoslavs gushing about a beloved classic, perhaps more than it deserves. For viewers outside Yugoslavia, few are likely to get all the references and humour, and so one will probably be so impressed as those reviewers giving this a perfect 10. Still, <i>Ko to tamo peva?</i> may be worth seeing for cinephiles abroad. Much of the comedy does come through. Furthermore, the work of the former Yugoslavia's most internationally acclaimed filmmaker, Emir Kusturica, riffs on some of the gags here. Indeed, the screenplay for this film was written by Dusan Kovacevic, who would eventually collaborate with Kusturica on <i>Underground</i>, and <i>Ko to tamo peva?</i> presents a similar view of the Balkan mentality as a lot of riotous eating, drinking, and dancing as in Kusturica's films.",5.0

Charles Dickens famous novel of an orphan boy, Oliver Twist, who escapes from his poor life to seek his fame and fortune in London, is adapted as a glossy musical.

Who would have thought that a story from the brilliant Dickens could be so sweet and endearing? So it be with Carol Reed's (Best Director Winner) unforgettable 1968 Best Picture Winner. Yes it's some way away from the essence of the source, those in need of that should be seeking out David Lean's fabulous 1948 version, but with an array of wonderful tunes and choreography, this Oliver is a treat for all the family. The cast are uniformly strong, notably Ron Moody (Fagin), Oliver Reed (who as Bill Sykes is probably playing himself!), Mark Lester (Oliver) and the fabulous Jack Wild (The Artful Dodger). While Lionel Bart's songs are as timeless as they are engaging.

The effects were pretty cool for that time, though not too sophisticated as they really didn't need do be.

Fired Up knows it's completely and outlandishly ridiculous and enjoys every goofy second of its insane existence. The premise of 2 guys skipping football camp to chase girls at cheerleading camp sounds like every other teen film but Fired Up is surprisingly fun, witty, and at moments even endearing. Eric Christian Olsen and Nicholas D'Agosto make a fantastic comedy duo, building one-liners on top of each other with excellent chemistry and hilarity. And John Michael Higgins is just as crazed and entertaining as ever. Overall, Fired Up is a much better-than-average stupid humor movie with a cast and director that know how to do comedy.",9.0

Two popular high school football jocks (Eric Christian Olsen and Nicholas D'Agosto) decide to go to cheerleading camp in the summer instead of football camp in order to score with the ladies. Their plans go awry when one falls one of the head cheerleaders (Sarah Roemer) and they both find themselves wanting to help the squad win the camp competition.

The purpose of a teen dramadies like this is to entertain and elicit laughs; the great ones avoid too much raunchiness, etc. and offer strong subtexts (like 1995's ""Clueless"" and 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""). The good news is that ""Fired Up"" (2009) is surprisingly funny from beginning to end and it does have heartwarming elements. Despite being direct-to-video, it's obvious that a lot of thought and effort was put into the film.

For it to be effective, Olsen and D'Agosto have to work well together and they do. Olsen was 31 during filming and D'Agosto was 28, hardly high school age, and – while they do a good job of appearing high school age – their overall demeanor give 'em away. As for the females, Sarah is striking as Carly and there are quite a few curvaceous beauties, including the brunette cheerleading coach.

I would easily give ""Fired Up"" a grade of 'A-' if not for some unnecessary coarseness, implied raunch (in other words, there aren't any overtly raunchy scenes) and way too many 'gay'-oriented jokes. These aspects remove it from the realm of greatness, as far as I'm concerned.

Now, I understand that Disney puts out a lot of things with different companies. But Midnight Madness was released officially by the mouse. This is the first Disney movie that I have seen with such overt sexual content. It's wonderful!

The plot is in the same vein as movies like Cannonball Run or It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. This movie just mixes in a bit of Animal House and other College Comedies of the era. Five teams of bombastic stereotypical young-adults set out on a treasure hunt. They follow clues that lead them to locations with more clues. The winners are given a trophy. The secondary plot follows Adam and his brother Scott as they try to bond.

The teams are color coded. Green, Blue, Red, White and Yellow. The Green team is the Jocks. Your stereotypical meat-heads appropriately driving a cropped VW Bug called the Meat Wagon. Dirk Blocker plays Blaylock who has some hilarious scenes at a Pabst Blue Ribbon factory. Easily the best jock. The Blue team are jerks. Stephen Furst of Animal House is the leader. He is short tempered and seems unenthused. The Red team is the female group. Their memorable members are these obese twins that giggle, a lot. The White team are nerds. Their led by Eddie Deezen. 

The Yellow team is our star team. This is the featured team of the film. It features your stars like David Naughton, Debra Clinger, David Damas, Michael J. Fox and Joel Kenney as Flynch. Flynch is your McLovin' character. Fox is making his film debut in Midnight Madness. It's also an early feature that cameos Paul Rubens before his Pee-Wee Herman fame.

17979,"A Christmas Carol sings the haunted verses of Dickens through disjointed emotionless motion capture. “Bah! Humbug!” Zemeckis had always been fascinated with digital cinema. ‘The Polar Express’ was technological innovation at its more pure, yet ‘Beowulf’ stabbed itself through contrived art direction that failed to suit the dark environment it was showcasing. So when he heard the “House of Mouse” were adapting Dickens’ universally known tale (again...), he clearly joyfully jumped at the chance of producing more digital art. The inevitable question though is: why? Does a Victorian-era Christmas story warrant the unrefined technological advancement of motion capture? Yes and no, is the answer.

The tale itself remains intact, following closer to Dickens’ words than any other adaptation that preceded this. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge encounters various spirits that show the repercussions of his selfish acts, in a bid to rid the evils of ignorance and want. I’ve seen it. You’ve seen it. Your nan has definitely seen it. And probably your pet dog too. Whether it be live-action, Mickey Mouse or The Muppets, you have almost indefinitely seen an adaptation of this famous novella. It’s an important moral that warrants the several iterations over the course of cinema, teaching families the significance of generosity and Christmas spirit.

Much like its source material however, it’s a dark tale. Ghostly ghouls visiting an elderly lonely man, including his deceased business partner entrapped in shackles and the shadow of Sauron succumbing Scrooge to the depths of Mordor’s burning fires. Zemeckis took the core tone of Dickens’ novella and merged it with Disney’s typical holiday whimsicality. The end result? Inconsistent. It’s either too dark for children or too joyous for adults. The two jarring tones rarely worked, producing a conflicting adaptation. One moment Scrooge is dealing with a prostitute dragged away in a straining jacket. The next scene? Children having a snowball fight to the merry notes of Silvestri’s score. Neither producing an entirely cheerful Christmas flick or faithful replication. I’d rather have a 15-rated horror adaptation of A Christmas Carol, as intended of course.

Now for the motion capture. It is what it is I suppose. A technical achievement for its time, utterly outdated a decade later. Character models were stilted. Eyes lacked any expression whatsoever. When close to candle lighting, resembled waxworks. The Ghost of Christmas Past just looked terrible, with its face mismatching the rest of its anthropomorphic candle body. Environmentally speaking, the scenery and inanimate objects were stunningly designed. It really felt like Christmas in Victorian-era London. Just a shame that Zemeckis only tested the limitations of animation through scenes of padding. Scrooge chased by a grim reaper for five minutes. Scrooge flying around London for three minutes. Scrooge slowly becoming Jim Carrey for the film’s entirety. Seemed like additional efforts for gimmicky 3D extravaganza than actual substance.

Fortunately the voice acting was perfect. Carrey and his multitude of personas rarely matched Scrooge’s mundane lifestyle. But that’s why it worked so well! The various voices of the ghosts as well tested his voicing talent remarkably. Oldman as Cratchit added a touch of humility to the story, and again, suited the character perfectly.

A Christmas Carol is a smorgasbord of tonal clashes and technical anomalies. For every fantastic aspect is a tiresome trope. The gorgeous scenery design is counteracted by horrific motion capture. The source material’s darkness is restrained by forced whimsicality in an attempt to appeal to the masses. It’s not the ideal Christmas present I asked for, but I can make do with its contents. Bah!

Robert Zemeckis has assembled a solid vocal cast to compliment the eerily life-like characterisations and although they can look a little sterile at times, this is still a worthwhile reimagining of an oft told story that keeps a tight hold on the reins for ninety minutes of dark festive fantasy with a message of joy and hope.",6.0

Out of Disney, we get the kind of wacky family friendly comedy that serves a purpose on a miserable real life day.

There is at least one scene involving an injection that will remain in my mind (not that it made the most sense, given the character's connection with the injecter's sibling but...). Aside from that though, I don't think <em>'Bleeder'</em> offers all that much in my opinion. 6/10.",6.0

I struggled with the rather amateur style of this right from the start. It's narrated now and again by a clown-clad ""Jonny"" (which does make sense at the end) but for the remainder of this rather episodically staccato effort, the story can't quite decide if it's a comedy, or a thriller, or a drama - it's just a hotchpotch of actors each doing the odd scene or two to augment a pretty nondescript story led by the always underwhelming Winstone and supplemented by an underperforming Law. It's pretty rudderless throughout and by the conclusion I really couldn't care less who was singing the karaoke.",6.0

Evidence of a prehistoric shark is discovered near a resort town on the west coast of Mexican. A beach patrol chief (John Barrowman) and a paleontologist (Jenny McShane) team-up to see if the megalodon actually exists. It does and it’s feeding on beachgoers.

“Shark Attack 3: Megalodon” (2002) is not as bad as armchair critics say or as amusing as its supporters say in a “so bad it’s good” way. It’s somewhere in between. Jenny McShane returns from the first flick (1999), but the film’s not as good. Not that the first one was great or anything, but at least it had an original plot. This one rips-off “Jaws” too much, including the similar-sounding shark music. It’s also predictable. For instance, if the initial megalodon discovered is a baby, what do ya think that means? Nevertheless, the scene done at the 1-hour mark is effective.   

On the female front, Jenny’s three years older here and not as curvy or alluring. There are several glimpses of bikini-clad women in the periphery but they’re generally second rate with maybe one or two brief exceptions.

The movie was shot in Bulgaria, but the Mexican flag is shown in as many scenes as possible to convince viewers that it’s Mexico. I didn’t have a problem with this because the scenery was a decent stand-in for Mexico, it’s just that most of the actors are Eastern Europeans who are badly dubbed or speak with heavy accents.

The obvious CGI is unsurprisingly cartoonish, but the actual shark footage is good, filmed off the coast of South Africa. The main protagonists are decent and play it straight while the heavies are too over-the-top sinister. The few unintentional laughs don’t come until the final act.

The film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes.

18019,"Having finally beaten Pompey's armies, Caesar (Louis Calhern) has returned to Rome to the acclaim of it's population. A fourth term as consul and the title of dictator for life suit his ambitions but they cause alarm amongst those who feel this is the first step to absolutism. First amongst those suspicious characters is Cassius (John Gielgud) and together with Brutus (James Mason) and Casca (Edmund O'Brien) conclude that drastic action needs to be taken if they are to prevent him becoming king. They must, however, factor in the powerful Mark Antony (Marlon Brando) - Caesar's right hand man, and an honourable military figure. The Ides of March duly arrive, and history takes it course - and for me, that's when this adaptation of Shakespeare's play comes alive. The hitherto largely unseen Brando's character cleverly manipulates the mob into handing him an opportunity for vengeance on the assassins, and together with Octavius (Douglas Watson) a chance to wrest control of the empire for themselves. Many people have said that Gielgud was the finest of 20th century Shakesperian thespians and his performance here is potent and evocative. His character comes across as only slightly less ambitious than Caesar, and one way more venal. It's James Mason, though, who impresses most here. His Brutus imbues a sense of principal, of honour and integrity - he seems the only one not quite in it for himself. Both of these men deliver some legendary soliloquies with skill and adroitness. Brando really only gets the one significant kick at the ball as he delivers his eulogy, but here he delivers an impassioned speech to the baying crown that's as insightful as it is inciteful. Joseph L. Mankiewicz competently presides over a well produced and paced dramatisation of brutality, duplicity and pride - and he allows those on screen to demonstrate their abilities to deliver some slightly abridged but still complex dialogue strongly. Not be forgotten are a couple of important, if sparing, contributions from Greer Garson and Deborah Kerr and we are delivered of a great story of intrigue and power that I really enjoyed.",7.0

Mike Hammer is driving down a dark highway when a half naked blonde forces him to stop, this event sends Hammer spiralling on a journey that may have a cataclysmic consequence for all involved.

Kiss Me Deadly is a harsh movie, it contains an array of characters that are dislikable in the extreme, nobody can be trusted, and everyone on the surface appears to be selfish in their respective motivations. Taking in torture, murder, violence on tap, and a wonderful mystery plot, it's not hard to see why the film has gained a massive reputation as the years have rolled by - where although it's brutish in substance, the film is a damn riveting piece of work.

Ralp Meeker is excellent as Hammer, a character who refuses to lay down, he gets knocked down constantly, but he gets back up tougher than before, he becomes the kind of hard boiled guy who hits first and then asks questions later. The direction from Robert Aldrich is perfect, off-kilter camera work drags the viewer into this skew-whiff world that Hammer has entered, and we often only see shots of the bad guys torsos so as to make them faceless thugs. It's down right aggressive film making that hits the requisite thriller mark.

Kiss Me Deadly has influenced many others since its release, be it ""Repo Man"" or ""Pulp Fiction"", the impact is still being felt today. Containing a much talked about ending (both the restored and alternate endings work on differing levels to many), it's a film that leaves things up for discussion and debate, but what we do know for sure is that it's explosive and crowns what is now firmly established as a crime classic from the film noir splinter of film making styles. 8.5/10",9.0

Gossip is a Dramatic Thriller that was made fifteen years too late.

18050,"I sometimes wonder whether politics in the 21st century might be a bit more stable around the globe, were we not to have spent much of the last century sending folks like ""Father Chisholm"" all over the place imposing Christianity on peoples who had got along splendidly for aeons without it... This film depicts one such gentleman - a well meaning Father who struggles to find fulfilment at home in Scotland. His seminarian friend Edmund Gwenn is now the Bishop, and decides he needs a challenge - so he is duly dispatched to China where he is tasked with spreading his faith amongst those in a war-torn province coming to terms with the end of the Ming dynasty and the ascension of the new Republic. Oscar nominated Gregory Peck brings quite a bit of nuance to his role. He arrives to find his mission in ruins and a congregation he could count on one hand. His sense of humanity and his determination to help the poor, sick, and needy attracts the attention of the local mandarin, whose son he helps recover from a life-threatening illness. In return, he is provided with land and builders; builds a new mission and even manages to secure the services of three nuns - the senior of whom he has a bit of a contretemps with before war presents them all with more important issues to deal with... The story is told by way of a retrospective, so we know all along roughly what happens in the end - but Peck along with a solid supporting cast including Thomas Mitchell and Rosa Stradner keep this creatively photographed story engaging for an, admittedly, long 2¼ hours. Keep an eye out for a few short scenes from Vincent Price and a very young Roddy McDowell (just 16) too.",7.0
18061,"Though certainly epic in cinematographic terms, this is a really meandering and over-cast depiction of the Zulu defeat of the British garrison at Isandlwana at the end of the 19th century. I'm assuming it was made as a precursor of - and to capitalise upon - the far superior ""Zulu"" (1964) but right from the get-go it's just wordy and ponderous and, well, lacklustre. Peter O'Toole does exude a certain arrogance in his role as the Commander of the army (Lord Chelmsford) but Burt Lancaster - and his distinctly ropey accent - as ""Col. Durnford"", features all too sparingly to offer much more than a casual dig at the incompetencies of his boss as the Zulu and the soldiers of the Queen square up. This cast list is impressive but none of the assembled stars of stage and screen are really used to any great effect. History tells us what happens next, and the colourful action scenes are well put together with enthusiastic efforts from the Zulu themselves delivering well staged combat scenes. Sadly, though, we have to wait far too long for these to rescue this from the doldrums of colourful but procedural cinema that offers us little to nourish either our interest in the characters or in the colonial and ambitious politics of the region that prevailed at the time.

Their adaptation is very creative and I appreciated the choices they made to update the story.  I don't know what the connection is to the Mormons but it does not detract from the movie.  I don't think the word Mormon is heard in the movie, and the church they visit could be any modern church.  Having religious characters does help the characters stay true to their Austen-era values.  Most of the fun of any P&P adaptation is seeing the characters and I think they are all very consistent to the characters in the book as far as their motivations and personalities.  The biggest disappointment is the lack of a Mr. & Mrs. Bennett but they were probably trying to stay in budget.  The character Lady Catherine is also missing with Caroline Bingley taking over some of that plot drama.  Overall, I can recommend this movie to fans of the book.

18094,"**_Inspirational story of an obscure metal band from the 80s_**

This is a documentary chronicling the Toronto metal band Anvil, focusing on the friendship and aspirations of the two main band members, singer/guitarist Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner.

The band formed in the late 70s as Lips, but changed their name to Anvil upon obtaining a record deal in 1981. The mid-80s were a good time for the young band and they were expected to go on to great success, but it was not to be. Guitarist Dave Allison left the band in 1989 followed by bassist Ian Dickson in 1993. But Steve & Robb soldiered on with new members, releasing album after album up to the present (16 studio albums altogether, as of this writing). When the film was shot, Ivan Hurd was the second guitarist with Glenn ""Glenn Five"" Gyorffy on bass. Both are featured in the movie while original members Allison and Dickson are featured in the deleted scenes on the DVD (their scenes shouldn't have been cut IMHO).

This is a great inspirational documentary whether you like Anvil and metal/hard rock or not. I really like the band, but never heard their stuff until 2009 when I rented the 1988 movie Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers,"" which features two songs from Anvil's 1987 album STRENGTH OF STEEL, the catchy ""Straight Between the Eyes"" and ""Wild Eyes."" One critic claimed that their 1982 album METAL ON METAL was their best-selling recording, but that's simply not true, STRENGTH OF STEEL was; and, although it's maligned by some fans, it's easily one of their top albums and not ""too commercial,"" as some erroneously contend (check out songs like ""Concrete Jungle,"" ""Paper General,"" ""Kiss of Death"" and the aforementioned ""Straight Between the Eyes"").

Anvil were just as good in their own unique way as any of the so-called Big Four, Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer and Megadeth. If you don't believe me, check out their top albums, like WORTH THE WEIGHT. (The album being recorded in the movie, THIS IS THIRTEEN, is actually NOT one of their better recordings, song-wise, nor is the follow-up JUGGERNAUT OF JUSTICE, although each have their points of interest). So why didn't Anvil AT LEAST attain the success of the secondary bands of the Big Four (i.e. Megadeth and Slayer)? Cheap production of their 80's albums may be one reason, although the production wasn't THAT bad for the era and certainly listenable; it was superior, for instance, to the production of albums by the contemporary Venom. Perhaps their location had something to do with their inability to reach the next level, but then how did Rush (another Toronto-based band) become so successful? (Then again, Rush switched from prog metal/rock to pop rock in the 80s). Bad management is likely another possibility. The reason is probably a combination of factors, including the band's sense of humor, Lips' outrageous antics and their sometimes goofy or juvenile lyrics (e.g. ""Straight Between the Eyes"").

In any case, this is a great documentary on the travails of trying to make it in a struggling rock/metal band. Their European tour shows that the lifestyle is difficult and takes dedication, to say the least: They miss trains, arrive late at a club in Prague because they were lost, play before small non-crowds, don't get paid and are offered goulash as a substitute. At a festival in Transylvania with a 10,000-seat capacity only 174 people show up. While there are certainly some high points on their tour it's mostly terrible. Steve, ever the optimist, responds, ""Everything on the tour went drastically wrong. But at least there was a tour for it to go wrong on.""

I know of a local struggling metal band, by the way, that's currently touring Europe and I'm sure they're facing the exact same kinds of challenges.

Anvil's family members are loyal, but think maybe they should throw in the towel. Yet Steve & Robb march forward in faith. A famous producer decides to produce their next album THIS IS THIRTEEN (2007), but it's going to cost thousands of dollars. Where are they going to get the money? And how are they going to release the album without a record contract? A Japanese promoter shows interest in having them play at a festival, but will more than a handful of fans show up?

Then you have Steve and Robb's great friendship, which is seriously tested at times, like during the stress of recording their new album in England: Tempers flare, one quits in frustration and the other apologizes. Will they stay together?

""Anvil: The Story of Anvil"" is an entertaining lesson on faith in one's calling, perseverance, friendship, teamwork, glory/humility and the nature of true success.

The film doesn't wear out its welcome at 80 minutes.

18117,"This is one of those films that I recommend to everyone who love movies and great acting.   It was little seen upon its release which is a shame because it has some of the most sublime and subtle acting as well as a moving and at times hilarious screenplay.

Set in Edwardian England, we meet Fisk senior, an elderly gentleman looked after by his son, Fisk Junior, and house keeper, Mrs Brimley.  Fisk senior has withdrawn from life and as a part of his son trying to keep him involved in society, they visit a talk on reincarnation where they briefly meet local clergyman, Dean Spanley.  Following a further chance meeting, Fisk junior decides that he would like to spend more time with the reclusive Spanley, but he can only do so if he can procure a bottle of Imperial Tokaji (formerly spelled Tokay in English).  

As I mentioned, the acting in this film is superb by all, Northam with his quiet frustration with his father as Fisk junior and Brown does his “abrasive” Australian.  But it is Sam Neil and Peter O'Toole who are the highlights – their acting, particularly during close ups, is at times incredible.  

Full credit to Toa Fraser for bringing these performances out with his light-handed direction.  

The beginning of the film can be a bit slow but I believe that this was done on purpose as a reflection of Fisk senior's life...as we journey with him, the film opens up more.  

I highly recommend this film, especially if you can try some Tokaji when you watch it.

18118,"How to succeed by failing big?

Mackenna's Gold is directed by J. Lee Thompson and adapted for the screen by Carl Foreman from a novel of the same name written by Henry Wilson Allen (AKA: Heck Allen, Henry Allen & Will Henry!), which in turn is loosely based on the legend of the Lost Adams Diggings. It stars Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Camilla Sparv, Julie Newmar, Ted Cassidy & Telly Savalas. It's photographed by Joseph MacDonald in Technicolor and Super Panavision, with a music score by Quincy Jones. 

It begins so well, the credits inform us that not only do we get Peck, Sharif and Newmar in lead roles, but that we also have in support a role call of quality thespians: Eli Wallach, Edward G. Robinson, Raymond Massey, Burgess Meredith, Lee J. Cobb, Keenan Wynn & Anthony Quayle. We are then treated to some gorgeous aerial photography of Monument Valley, a Vulture glides gracefully thru the air, and then, we hear the awful strains of ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" warbled like it belongs in a seventies porn movie by José Feliciano. It's there that the true marker for Mackenna's Gold is set. 

The idea and source for the plot is safe, Lawman Mackenna (Peck) has the knowledge of where the legendary Canyon of Gold is. A fabled place awash with gold but guarded religiously by the Apache. With the map safely tucked away in his brain, Peck is quickly captured by blood thirsty Mexican bandit, Colorado (Sharif), and his companions, one of which (Newmar playing Indian Hesh-Ke) has past history with Mackenna. But that's not all, pretty soon Mackenna's party are joined by a whole host of other gold seekers, all seemingly gripped with Gold Fever. So in fighting and suspicion ensues, and with the Cavalry in pursuit of Colorado and the Apache still to come, this is as dangerous as it gets. If only the film wasn't so choppy and flat. 

The film was originally a three hour epic, complete with intermission, but the budget probably all went on securing the cast and the producers don't seem able to deal with the task of making a big budget epic. Thus the film was cut to just over two hours; thank god for small mercies! Looking at the cast assembled it's obvious that this was a very ambitious project meant to keep the Western flag flying high and enthral the adventure seeking cinema goer. And you can see why such a quality cast signed on for the film, tho Peck was second choice after Clint Eastwood wisely chose to make Hang Em High instead. But what plays out is a series of clichés and absurdities that makes one unintentionally laugh. The effects are awful, I mean OK we don't expect back screen work to be high class, but here, with the actors half heartedly pretending it's real, it belies the fine work of MacDonald for the exteriors. 

The problems don't just stop with the effects, before we even get to the issues in the cast, there's Jones' dreadful score to try and ignore. It sounds like he thinks he's scoring a Keystone Cops Gold Rush type movie! Dimitri Tiomkin, along with Foreman, is on production duties (hmm), I'm sure he could have knocked up something better for this film in his sleep. Peck is actually OK, with that laconic way of his, he suits the tone of the narrative. Sharif is grossly miscast, while Sparv is simply woeful. Newmar raises the temperatures of audience and cast alike, which you sense was her only instruction, while the lauded support cast file in and out without time to impact on proceedings. All of which leads to a finale of ham, model work and predictability. Yet there's been just enough to make the undemanding stay to the end. We wonder if indeed there is a Canyon of Gold, and Peck is so likable we just want to see him win out and defy the baddies.

18118,"***Entertaining, but comic booky 1969 Western with a superlative cast***  

""MacKenna's Gold"" (1969) deals with the insanity of ‘gold fever’ and builds-up a good amount of anticipation concerning the secret gold canyon. Does it exist or doesn’t it? Western expert Brian Garfield (author of ""Death Wish"") commented on ""MacKenna's Gold"" in his outstanding book ""Western Films"" thusly: ""it hasn't a single redeeming quality. It has got to be the most expensive star-studded two-hour ‘B’ movie ever made; a gargantuan dud of absolutely stunning dreadfulness.""

It hasn't a SINGLE redeeming quality? Okay, let me list a smattering: Outstanding cast, including Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Ted Cassidy, Julie Newmar, Telly Savalas, Carmilla Sparv and many more, albeit mostly cameos; one of the greatest Western scores of all time by Quincy Jones, which ranks up there with ""How the West Was Won,"" ""Rio Lobo,"" ""Duel at Diablo,"" ""Bandolero!"" ""Bonanza,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (to name a handful); a standout theme song, ""Old Turkey Buzzard,"" sung by Jose Feliciano, written by Jones; and magnificent locations (Utah, Arizona, Rogue River Oregon) & cinematography.

Plus, although the story has an undeniable comic booky vibe (which explains why Garfield referred to it as a ""B"" movie), it is played out in a completely serious manner. And pretty much holds your attention while creating much anticipation regarding the legendary canyon.

Gregory Peck, who plays Marshal MacKenna, and Carmilla Sparv are definitely the ""good guys."" The film was made at a time (the late 60s) when characters in Westerns tended to be unlikable or amoral (e.g. ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Macho Callahan""), and this movie has its fill as well, but it's nice to have some quality protagonists.

Omar Sharif plays the head Mexican bandit ""Colorado"" excellently. It's sort of an atypical role for him, but he performs with such gusto it seems he was born to play the part. Ted Cassidy, well-known as ""Lurch"" on TV's The Addam's Family, plays the intimidating, laconic Indian warrior Hachita. He superbly fits the character (regardless of whether or not he has AmerIndian blood running through his veins). Julie Newmar is likewise great as a CRAZY squaw. Red-blooded males will be interested to know that she has a nude swimming scene.

Quincy Jones' opening score and the theme song ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" are so stirring (especially combined with the magnificent Southwest photography) that sometimes I'll just play the beginning of the film, which runs a full 6-8 minutes (!). I've heard some complain that ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" is corny. But, speaking as someone who’s never been much of a fan of County/Western music, ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" is just a potent composition, regardless of the musical genre. It effectively comments on man's temporal nature and the insane & contagious condition of gold fever.

While ""MacKenna's Gold"" certainly lacks the gritty realism of, say, the contemporaneous ""The Wild Bunch,"" it is indeed a serious film despite some undeniable cartoonish aspects. One could also probably nitpick about the not-quite-successful F/X miniature sequences, but that's not important; what is important is the film's entertainment value. At the end of the day ""MacKenna's Gold"" entertains.

The movie runs 2 hours, 8 minutes.

The Grifters is directed by Stephen Frears and adapted to screenplay by Donald E. Westlake from the novel of the same name written by Jim Thompson. It stars Anjelica Huston, John Cusack and Annette Bening. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Oliver Stapleton.

“The best reason I can think of is that you scare the hell out of me. I have seen women like you before, baby. You're double-tough and you are sharp as a razor, and you get what you want or else; but you don't make it work forever. Sooner or later the lightning hits, and I'm not gonna be around when it hits you”

1990 was a grand year for neo-noir, of the dozen + titles that came out that year, The Grifters sits atop of the pile. A superlative film noir that boasts class on the page and on both sides of the camera. Set in modern day Los Angeles, the story follows three cynical and sly con artists through a psychological fog of bluff, double bluff, pain, misery, manipulations and shattering developments. That the trio consists of a boyfriend, girlfriend and an estranged mother only darkens the seamy waters still further.

Los Angeles positively bristles with a smouldering atmosphere thanks to the work of Frears, Bernstein and Stapleton. Sexual tension is ripe, Westlake’s adaptation doing justice to Thompson’s novel, while the three leads – and Pat Hingle in super support – are on fire, bringing complex characters vividly to life as they trawl through the devilishly labyrinthine plot, adding biting humour and shallow savagery into the bargain.

Tricky. It's a decent film, lovely to look at with its scope photography and technicolor palettes, James Garner and Edmond O'Brien are holding court in the acting stakes, and of course this being a submarine war film it has the requisite claustrophobic feel. Yet it never really gels as a whole, submerging too far into the mundane to play out a whole bunch of sequences that test the patience of the viewer. There's also the not too small problem of being able to suspend disbelief with the final mission.

Now this is Hollywood and a Warner Brothers film, in 1959, so we don't naturally expect realism in our story telling, in fact we often want incredulity to stir the blood, but this kinda takes the rise too far. Alan Hale Junior is on hand for comic relief, and this proves good foil for Garner's lovable charm, but Gordon Douglas directs at such a snails pace you get the feeling that the comedy is just a merciful release for all involved. In short there's both the good and bad of 1950s war film making on show here; production value is high - narrative thrust is tepid. 6/10",6.0

As a weapon of war, they aways provided a great vehicle for an adventure - great atmosphere, murky depths and torpedos that seemed very rarely to hit what they were aimed at! Best of all, though, there was positively no room at sea, on the boat, for any slushy romance!! This film opens with James Garner (""Braden"") doing his best impression of the beach scene in ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953) with Andra Martin (""Sally"") and my heart sank - yuk, I thought! Yet, no - stick with it. Shortly after all this sand in the swimsuit malarkey and a marriage proposal after knowing each other for a fortnight, he is shipped out to Pearl Harbour and is soon at sea engaged on a perilous top secret mission to photograph some Japanese radio codes. Edmond O'Brien is his captain - the men don't initially hit it off, and Alan Hale Jr (""Malone"") is the generally jovial Irish man in the middle trying to keep the peace, and the pace starts to pick up nicely. Garner was better with more comedic roles; he's probably nobody's idea of an hero but he does OK with this. The tension with O""Brien is just too forced, though - we know all along what's going to happen, so why create this extra layer of animosity?

In a land where duty is everything, this film depicts the rather unfeeling, though never callous, way in which the elderly pair are bundled from pillar to post, to a spa populated by youngsters and ultimately into the care of their widowed daughter-in-law ""Noriko"" (Setsuko Hara) who makes time to look after and try to entertain them. The film takes it's time. The delicate performances from the older couple are a joy to watch, especially once he ""Shukichi"" (Chishû Ryû) has had some saki with his friends; and she ""Tomi"" (Chieko Higashiyama) is superb as the long suffering, kindly wife who has a stoicism that is both entertaining and laudable. It all comes to an head in quite a sadly poignant fashion, allowing the brief appearance of their other son ""Keiso"" (Shirô Ôsaka) for a conclusion that is both depressing and yet oddly fitting. This is beautifully crafted observation of changing family dynamics, or priorities and of, well, just taking people for granted.",7.0
18158,"Restrained but still an effective piece of sci-fi pie.

Reports of flying saucers start coming in thick and fast until sure enough alien invaders begin to attack the Earth. Focal point of their attack is the U.S. Space Programe, can hero in waiting Russel Marvin conjure up a defence weapon to save the day?

Obviously a template for many an alien invader film since its release, Earth Vs The Flying Saucers never quite reaches the heights that perhaps it should have. Bogged down by maudlin scripting and restricted by its budget, it often hints at what a great picture it could have been. The lead cast are poor and this hurts the film even more, Hugh Marlowe as Russell Marvin bores us with the scientific speak when really he should be fascinating us, whilst scream queen duties fall to poor Joan Greenwood who forgets that she is actually supposed to emit some sort of terror when the alien hordes attack! However, on the plus side the aliens themselves are certainly creepy enough to grab your notice, Ray Harryhausen's flying saucers animation is of course top dollar for its time, whilst the final battle across Washington DC is classic gold, an all buzzing assault with splurges of death rays at every turn.

18191,"It never hurts a movie to have both William H. Macy and Joe Mantegna, not least because there’s a good chance it’s a David Mamet film. Mantegna appears briefly in Edmond, adapted by Mamet from his one-act play and directed by Stuart Gordon, but his intervention is key.

Edmond Burke (Macy) encounters Mantegna’s character in a bar, and after the two bond over their shared racism, the latter gives the former a card with the address of a nightclub, but which Edmond momentarily sees as a Tarot card: the Hierophant.

This is ironic because the Hierophant is believed to bring religious worshipers into the presence of what is sacred, and in The Rider-Waite Tarot Deck it represents conformity to social norms or a deference to the established moral and social order, being a guide to knowledge, perception and wisdom.

Thus, in the Apollonian guise of the Hierophant, Mantegna is actually a Dionysian agent, gently nudging Edmond toward the profane and immoral, and into an downward spiral of hatred, ignorance, and crime.

The protagonist’s name is equally ironic. Edmond is related to Edmundi, which itself is derived from the Old English ēad, meaning “prosperity” or “riches”, and mund, meaning “protector.”

During the course of this fateful night, however, we see Edmond haggling fruitlessly with prostitutes, and generally illustrating the proverb 'a fool and his money are soon parted.' Additionally, more than a protector, Edmond becomes someone to be protected from.

Edmond is an utterly vile and despicable being, concerned exclusively with sex and money — specifically how much of the latter he's willing to part with in exchange for the former (Macy's performance is notable for making Edmond a human scum without entirely repelling us; his company is abhorrent and at the same time fascinating).

His victims are not shown in a much more positive light, though; they are no better than Edmond, only slightly less bad. For instance, the African-American man that Edmond beats up within an inch of his life, each blow accompanied by a racist slur, tried to mug Edmond whilst pretending to be a pimp.

And when Edmond finally manages to hold sexual congress — ironically with the only woman he approaches who is not a prostitute —, she turns out to be just as intolerant as he is. Edmond nonetheless kills her because she, an aspiring actress, refuses to admit she’s nothing but a glorified waitress.

Gordon and Mamet don't just condemn white male supremacy; they accuse society as a whole — everyone is accountable (although some more than others, and Edmond certainly receives a punishment proportional, not only to his crime, but also to his racism and homophobia); it’s only when Edmond is isolated from that society that Mamet and Gordon denounce, only when he himself severs any tenuous ties that might bind him to the outside world, that he finds some sort of redemption, and learns to love his fellow man — literally as well as figuratively.",6.0

Cagney stands out, but Annabella (""Madame de Beaumont"") and both Richard Conte (""O'Connell"") and Frank Latimore (""Lassister"") work well too, to keep the suspense running well for much of this 90 minute adventure. The story has plenty of action, only a modicum of romance to clutter up the drama and it delivers a strong sense of just how perilous the lives of these fighters, and their counter-espionage colleagues, actually was in the occupied territories.

18203,"**A forgotten film about naive, deeply believable and human people.**

There are certain films where everything depends on the actors' performance, and this is one of them. The dialogues are truly rich, the development of the characters and the ways they interact is highly valued, the plot is reduced to the simplest it can be and almost everything happens in the limited space of the Italian restaurant. It looks like a play, and that even leads me to believe that the film could be an adaptation of a play.

Such simplicity and minimalism obviously mean that there was no significant financial investment on the production side. Cheap to make, with touches of indie cinema and quality personnel in the cast and crew, the film meets the necessary goals to entertain us pleasantly for some time, but it will never be unforgettable for anyone. In fact, it is quite forgotten nowadays, which I completely understand.

Technically, the film does everything without mistakes, but it doesn't take any risks: the cinematography doesn't bring anything new or bold moves, rather the regular average that is presented without a single error. In common, the soundtrack is perfectly forgettable and the scenarios, although good and perfectly credible, do not have any particular interest. Even the restaurant is banal, an average establishment without any kind of interest, where you go for the quality of the food and not exactly for the atmosphere.

The plot is very simple and works excellently: two brothers, Italian immigrants, have a restaurant that is about to close because they didn't know how to manage it and gain customers; This leads them to listen to the advice of the owner of a competing restaurant and invite singer Louis Prima to dinner in the hope of boosting the business. The brothers are, each in their own way, perfectly naive! If one is unable to understand that in a business like that, the customer is in charge and not the cook, the other decides to trust the advice of someone who had every reason to harm them. This makes them human, believable, and it is impossible not to suffer for them. The naivety is not just theirs: the character of Minnie Driver is also deeply naive in her own way, in the way she becomes romantically involved and allows herself to be deceived.

Stanley Tucci, intelligently, collaborated directly in writing the script and the result was one of the best works of his career, with the actor in a role that he tailored to his own abilities and qualities, without prejudice to his colleagues, to whom he gives the necessary space to showcase their talent. Thus, Tony Shalhoub also makes the film an authentic calling card, proving his qualities as an actor. In a more reserved position, we must also highlight the collaboration of Minnie Driver and Ian Holm, and also the special participation of Isabella Rossellini, who brightens the film with her occasional but very committed collaboration.",7.0

18223,"Poison Ivy: The Secret Society is the “sexy girl version of The Skulls” (Wikipedia), but I think it’s more like the 'dumb blonde version.' I'm not saying that the protagonist's intellectual ineptitude is directly related to her gender or hair color; her golden mane and femininity are just an unfortunate coincidence. 

Danielle Brooks (Miriam McDonald) is a farm girl — completing the trifecta of stereotypes — who transfers to Berkshire College, an elite New England private school. Danielle sold the property she inherited from her late parents to pay for school, and yet the best she can afford is a work-study program. Oh, and her nickname is Daisy. How do I know all this? It’s all in the ""Berkshire Transfer Students Official List,"" (BTSOL, if you’re into the whole brevity thing) of which we even see a copy. I swear, they could show a character literally reading directly off the script, and it wouldn’t be as dumb as this. 

Daisy, by the way, is the name of a flower, as is Azalea (Shawna Waldron), who is the president of the Ivys, a ""secret"" society that everyone on campus knows about; on the other hand, it must be impossible to keep a secret in a college so small that, as far as we can see, only offers one single, solitary course, attended by all the main characters, and taught by Professor Andrew Graves (Greg Evigan), who is not only married to the dean (Catherine Hicks), but is also the father of Daisy's romantic interest, Blake (Ryan Kennedy).

Azalea learns that Daisy is a shoo-in to get a coveted internship; the former’s plan to prevent this from happening is to get Daisy to join the so-called secret society. “Turning the farm girl into an Ivy won't stop her from getting the internship,” Blake warns her; Azalea's response is ""yeah, we'll see about that"". Spoiler alert: we never see about that. 

What we do see is the Ivy’s vast influence (one can't help but wonder why Azalea doesn't just use this leverage to nab the internship for herself). Once Daisy is accepted, she doesn't have to worry about money anymore; “Who do you think made your financial aid problems go away? Who do you think gave you your scholarship?” Azalea asks rhetorically. To my chagrin, though, she doesn't ask who makes Steve Guttenberg a star.

Do the writers (unbelievably, it took three people to write this movie) really expect us to believe that, on top of selling the family ranch or whatever, Daisy still needs not only a student loan but also a scholarship, or do they just not understand the difference between the two? 

I lean towards option B, especially after seeing the way Azalea blackmails Daisy, which involves Will (Brendan Penny), Daisy’s rancher boyfriend whom she left behind (“how do you know about Will,” Daisy asks; my guess is she must have read it on BTSOL). 

Azalea claims to ""have this piece of paper and at the top it says ""title deed"", at the bottom, a name and it's ""William Miller""."" Daisy never even demands to see this document, so she may just be dumb enough to believe that ""Will's land"" really ""is at stake,"" as Azalea later assures her; moreover, recording Azalea's confession and immediately playing the tape back to her is likewise not the action of a person of at least adequate intelligence.",1.0
18228,"_**Elvis goes to Hawaii**_

After a two-year enlistment in the service, Chad Gates (Presley) returns home to Hawaii, but prefers the genuineness of the Polynesians and blazing his own trail to being the heir to his parents’ pineapple plantation. With his half-Caucasian/half-Polynesian girlfriend (Joan Blackman) he tries his hand as a tour guide. Angela Lansbury is on hand as the amusingly snooty mother.    

“Blue Hawaii” (1961) was the first and easily the best of three Elvis flicks set in Hawaii, followed by “Girls! Girls! Girls!” (1962) and “Paradise, Hawaiian Style” (1966). Actually, it ranks with his better movies, like ""Kid Galahad"" (1962), “Roustabout” (1964) and “Viva Las Vegas"" (1964). 

Several things make this one work: The magnificent locations, the trivia about Hawaii & Hawaiians, the compelling story, the serious-but-fun vibe and, of course, the music. Speaking of which, this one has more songs than usual.

On the downside, the female cast could’ve been better, although winsome Blackman is a’right. Nevertheless, the subplot about Chad (Elvis) being the tour guide of an attractive school teacher (Nancy Walters) and five teenage girls is entertaining, especially the shenanigans with the curmudgeonly lass (Jenny Maxwell). 

The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot in Hawaii and Paramount Studios, California.

Either way, that didn't affect my enjoyment at all.

Having only seen Ryan Reynolds in his present day comedy machine it is so odd seeing him act less jokey and more serious, even if you can still spot the quintessential Reynolds comedic delivery in there every now and then. It takes a little bit to get over that but eventually a strong performance is clearly visible. Sandra Bullock fits this realm comfortably and is also very good throughout.

The film does a neat job at making it all believable, the journey from where the two characters begin to where they finish is one that somehow feels natural.

An American man (Jeffrey Combs) inherits a castle about an hour’s drive north of Rome and brings his wife & daughter (Barbara Crampton and Jessica Dollarhide). The couple is troubled by the husband’s alcoholism, which caused the death of their young son. Meanwhile the teen daughter insists that someone else is dwelling in the castle. Havoc ensues.

I didn’t have high hopes for “Castle Freak” (1995) due to the blunt title and cheesy movie poster, but it’s surprisingly well done for a flick that only cost $500,000. I couldn’t help be reminded of HP Lovecraft’s “The Dunwich Horror” (1970) and therefore wasn’t surprised to find out the film was inspired by Lovecraft’s ""The Outsider.""

The tone and setting is similar to “Subspecies” (1991), just exchange the vampire for a contorted monstrosity. Speaking of the undead, the milieu also brings to mind Dracula flicks, like the most recent (at the time) “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992).

The first half takes its time to set up the characters, create some Gothic mood and milk suspense while the second half turns increasingly horrific and tragic. Psychologically, there are several gems to mine, like the consequences of abuse and folly, not to mention potential redemption and forgiveness in a fallen world. Culturally, this is a great flick to get a feel for pastoral Italy.

Raffaella Offidani appears on the feminine front as a chic courtesan and I couldn’t help thinking of Halle Berry. I prefer Jessica Dollarhide as Rebecca, but not enough is done with her (not talkin’ ’bout nudity or sleaze). Speaking of which, there’s some nakedness and a little passionate sex on display, as well as utterly gruesome bits. Just a heads up.

The ending was, incidentally, ripped off in “Cold Creek Manor” (2003). Meanwhile a reimaging was released in 2020 under the same title, but I have yet to see it (although the trailer is intriguing).

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Giove & Attigliano, Italy, including the castle owned by executive producer Charles Band. The region is 45 miles due north of Rome. I shouldn’t close without mentioning Luca Zingaretti’s significant role as the sheriff.

18262,"And you can kiss tomorrow goodbye!  

Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is directed by Gordon Douglas and adapted to screenplay by Harry Brown from the novel by Horace McCoy. It stars James Cagney, Barbara Payton, Helena Carter, Ward Bond, Luther Adler and Steve Brodie. Music is by Carmen Dragon and photography by J. Peverell Marley. 

Ralph Cotter (Cagney), career criminal, escapes from prison and crudely murders his partner during the escape. Hooking up with Holiday Carleton (Payton), the oblivious sister of the slain partner, Cotter quickly gets back into a life of crime and violence. Will his evil deed stay a secret? How long can he keep the corrupt coppers under wraps? And is his ""other"" romantic relationship with Margaret Dobson (Carter) doomed to failure? 

Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye seems to have gotten lost in the slipstream of White Heat which was released the previous year. An undoubted classic of the gangster/crime genre, and featuring one of Cagney's greatest acting performances, White Heat has unsurprisingly dwarfed many other below par genre entries. However, while it doesn't equal the searing ferocity of White Heat, both in tone and character performance by Cagney, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is a seriously hard as nails movie. Energetic from the off, film is often brutal and cynical and awash with potently memorable scenes, with some deemed as being just too much, resulting in the film even being banned from theatres in Ohio! 

Female or a cripple, it matters not to the menacing force of nature that is Ralph Cotter. 

Gordon Douglas was a multi genre director, unfussy and able to keep things taut, he gets some super performances from the cast while never letting the pace sag. Cagney is a given, give him this sort of character and let him run with it and the rewards are plenty, though to an extent it's arguably a detriment to the film as a whole that it can't match Cagney's blood and thunder show. that said, Bond (big bad corrupt copper), Brodie (Cotter side-kick) and Adler (shifty lawyer) do shine through with imposing in character turns. 

Of much interest in the narrative is the dual lady characters that are firmly in Cotter's life. Both are very different from each other, and this gives the film a double whammy of femme fatales in waiting. Payton takes the honours, in what is the best written part in the film, where her Holiday Carleton is a good girl drawn in to a murky life by a bad man. While on the other side of the fence is Carter as bored rich girl Margaret Dobson, she likes fast cars and dangerous men, and this allows the actress to deftly sidle in to impact with potency in the smaller role. 

Photography isn't out of the ordinary, where the pic cries out for some film noir styled psychological menace, and the music is standard boom and bluster for a crime picture. But really this is about Cagney's super performance and the grim thematics contained within the piece, where much like Ralph Cotter himself, it doesn't ever pull its punches.

18262,"James Cagney positively oozes malevolence in this gritty and dark thriller. He is ""Cotter"", a violent man who escapes from prison with the help the rather naive ""Holiday"" (Barbara Peyton). Pretty soon she is putty in his hands, swiftly followed by a couple of bent cops - and before we know it, he is running quite a successful little crime syndicate with a brand new identity. A chance encounter with the wealthy socialite ""Margaret Dobson"" (Helena Carter) tantalises the avaricious young man, despite warnings that her father was not a man to be trifled with. Soon, she too is captivated and when he leaves ""Holiday"" to take up with her, it starts to look much more perilous for all concerned. This story is told by way of a courtroom retrospective, but unusually that doesn't rob the film of much of it's jeopardy. We don't know quite what happened, and to whom, until quite an effective ending that I felt quite fitting. Cagney is on great form, and with Peyton and Carter offering us fine examples of women who are just so enamoured that they cannot see past this cruel and manipulative man. There is also a solid supporting cast - Ward Bond and Luther Adler amongst them, the dialogue is tightly scripted and delivered and the whole thing has a sleazy and grizzled outlook that I found appealing and appalling in equal measure.

Will Lockhart (James Stewart) leaves his home in Laramie on a mission to find out who was responsible for selling repeating rifles to the Apaches who killed his brother. Landing in Coronado, New Mexico, he finds that most of the territory is owned and ruled by Alec Waggoman (Donald Crisp), a fierce patriarchal rancher with one loose cannon son, Dave (Alex Nicol) and another surrogate son, Vic Hansboro (Arthur Kennedy) running the Barb Ranch. As he digs deeper, Lockhart finds he is in the middle of two wars, one of which may eventually conclude his revenge fuelled mission.

The Man From Laramie is the last of the five Westerns that director Anthony Mann made with leading man James Stewart. The only one filmed in CinemaScope, it is a visually stylish picture that is full of brooding psychological themes and boasts great acting and a tight script. It's no secret that Mann, before his sad death, was looking to make a Western King Lear, The Man From Laramie serves as a delicious starter to what would have been the main course. With its family dilemmas and oedipal overtones, Mann's Western is very Shakespearian in tone. That its characters are sumptuously framed amongst a harsh dangerous landscape further fuels the psychological fire; with the landscapes (terrificly photographed by Charles Lang) providing a link to the characters emotional states. So many scenes linger long and hard in the memory (none of which I would dare to spoil for would be new viewers), so much so they each reward more upon subsequent revisits to the film. There's some minor quibbles down the pecking order; for instance Cathy O'Donnell as Barbara Waggoman is poor and contributes little to proceedings, but really it remains a quality piece of psychological work that barely gives us reason to scratch the itch.

Jimmy Stewart stars as the titular man who meets a storekeeper (Cathy O'Donnell) while delivering supplies to a Southwestern town in Apache territory. It doesn't take long for him to clash with the rash son of domineering rancher (Alex Nicol and Donald Crisp). Despite the mounting tensions, he stays in town perhaps because he's sweet on the woman, but so is the rancher's formidable foreman (Arthur Kennedy). More importantly, he's searching for the mystery man who's been selling rifles to the Apaches.

Disregarding the hopelessly hokey title song during the opening & ending credits,  Anthony Mann's ""The Man from Laramie"" (1955) is a winning mid-50's Western, the last of five Westerns Mann did with Stewart and easily the best of the latter four. The vast New Mexican landscapes in gorgeous color are magnificent. The compelling story is a little complicated, but not overly so. O'Donnell is winsome as the proverbial girl-next-door.

It runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in Taos & Santa Fe, New Mexico.

18274,"Lazy pre-""Jaws"" nature-nuns-amok flick  

RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by George McCowan, ""Frogs"" chronicles events when myriad swamp creatures (frogs, snakes, alligators, lizards, scorpions, tarantulas, crabs, etc.) vengefully attack a crotchety old man's Southern mansion in the swamp. Apparently, they’re hopping mad about the toxic chemicals used to exterminate them, not to mention pollutants in general. The film stars Ray Milland as the old grump, a mustache-less Sam Elliott and a young Joan Van Ark.

""Frogs"" predates ""Jaws"" (1975) by a few years. The creators were obviously going for a swamp version of the basic ""The Birds"" (1963) plot. The difference is that ""The Birds"" is a first-rate flick whereas ""Frogs"" is second rate, which isn’t to say that it’s unprofessional or that there aren’t points of interest. Any fan of nature-runs-amok flicks should find something to like. The film gives you what you pay for: Real swamp locations with real swamp creatures horrifyingly attacking and killing people, not to mention a grand antebellum mansion and grounds.

The best thing is that the story is taken seriously. There's no silliness or camp to be seen as in, say, ""Lake Placid"" (1999) or ""Crocodile"" (2000). Another highlight is Joan Van Ark who’s quite fetching at 28 during shooting. Lynn Borden and Judy Pace are also worth mentioning in the feminine department. On the other side of the gender spectrum, there’s Elliott, who’s excellent as the low-key macho protagonist, as well as Adam Roarke and David Gilliam, amongst others.

The main problem with “Frogs” is that there isn't any suspense; the tone is curiously lazy. But if you're a fan of creatures-on-the-loose films or any of the cast members then you'll probably find something to appreciate. It has more originality than the many post-""Jaws"" flicks and there are indeed a few horrifying parts. Just don't expect a Class A film like ""The Birds"" or much suspense and you won't be disappointed.

For any who complain that the name of the film is inaccurate in light of the fact that there are various bog creatures attacking the people, not just frogs, think about it like this: The frogs are like little Napoléons sending their soldiers into the fray.

Along with some friends, they must help Cassandra (Demi) save her grandfather's house from the greedy Beckersted Family.

She was 22 during filming and looks great, but she curiously wears big, loose clothing throughout, which conceals her physical beauty. But there are a few notable females in peripheral roles, such as Kimberly Foster as cookie. There's also a Godzilla parody that's great fun.

His ideal existence comes to a bit of an abrupt halt, though, when his alcoholic courtesan of a mother ""Rebecca"" (Rebecca Pan) reveals to him in a drunken stupor that she isn't actually his mother at all. The rug has now been pulled from under his cocky feet and he now embarks on a rather self destructive journey to find out just who the real woman is. After an initial relationship with ""Su Li-zhen"" (Maggie Cheung) he finds himself hooked up with dancer ""Mimi"" (Carina Lau) but no nearer his ultimate goal. It's only when ""Rebecca"" decides to set off with her newest beau for a new life that she dispatches ""Yuddy"" to the Philippines where his answer lies. Meantime, ""Su Li-zhen"" has again found herself alone after her boyfriend decides to leave his police job and become a sailor. Is it all possible that the two might reconcile? Now, there is definitely something of the episodic - even soap opera - about this film. An unlikable and frankly selfish character seeking his own truth for his own reasons, but to be fair to the director and the writers, they manage to elevate it from the more tabloid and gradually develop the characters into creatures with whom we can, to an extent, empathise. There are façades all over the place, truth and honesty and trust are near, but in shadows - and the use of the dark, rainy, Hong Kong scenarios provides ample locations for all of those to hide - and from which to be discovered. Not my favourite of Wong Kar-wai's films - it is just a little predicable - but still, he packs lots into ninety minutes and the cast deliver well - especially Maggie Cheung - and I did enjoy it.",7.0

Rarely has anyone tried to depict her early years and sadly, this is a rather shallow attempt so to do.

They separate and both find themselves leading lives that neither would have sought or really want - but yet they cannot go back; don't want to go back - even though one life takes on new positive meaning, whilst the other hits the skids. It's beautifully shot with director Wong Kar-Wai making full use of the grand scenery offered by the Argentine, but somehow I think that grandeur subsumed the story. The characters are strong, and both lead actors deliver well and consistently, but I couldn't help feeling a certain element of ennui as I watched it. It would be unfair to describe it as melodrama, but somehow the characters didn't engage me. Whilst I felt sympathy for ""Po-wing"" (Leslie Cheung) I found him rather irritating; his introspection grated on me after a while. ""Yiu-fai' (Tony Leung) offered more by way of validation - of optimism, but again it just didn't quite get my engagement genes firing.

Jerry Lewis stars, directs, produces and co-writes (with Bill Richmond) this comedy take on Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

The Nutty Professor is a film I adored as a child, and truth be told most of Jerry Lewis' films made a humorous mark in my spotty youth, but not many can now be viewed in adulthood and still tickle the rib cage with the same mirthful impact. The Nutty Professor still does to me now what it first did many many years ago.

Reading some of the reviews around the internet you can see some people going a bit deeper than is really necessary, yes there are some interesting things to delve into if you so wish, (beauty skin deep, the meek rising, be yourself, social acceptance issues etc etc) but ultimately it's a comedy spin on the Dr. Jekyll & Mr Hyde story with Jerry Lewis in sublime pratfall mode.

Lewis' reading of the ""good & bad"" side of one man is basically he expressing he himself, and he has great fun with both sides of the character. There's some very funny sequences along the way, reference Kelp's attempt at bulking up at the gym and jitterbugging at the dance, and all things build to the climax where common sense prevails as the heart strings get tugged and the smile lands firmly on the face. Joining Lewis in the froth broth as the love interest is Stella Stevens, who is not only socko sexy and gorgeous - splendidly attired in Edith Head's figure hugging costumes - she also proves to be great foil for both of Lewis' characterisations.

Hour of the Wolf (Vargtimmen) is written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. It stars Max Von Sydow, Liv Ullmann, Gertrud Fridh, Georg Rydeberg and Ingrid Thulin. Music is by Lars Johan Werle and cinematography by Sven Nyquist.

While vacationing on a remote Scandanavian island with his younger pregnant wife, an artist has an emotional breakdown while confronting his repressed desires. 

Is this really Ingmar Bergman's only genuine horror movie? I would argue that pretty much most of his movies have horrific elements. That said, this one is haunting in its dissection of a fragmented mind, to see the unravelling of an artistic persona tortured by repression, doubt and a nightmarish world that he, or us, are not sure exists or not.

When Bergman was at his pomp, he had this knack of drawing in his audience to be part of his plays, so it be here. Sydow yet again gives his all for his director, absolutely sinking into the role of troubled artist Johan Borg. Ullman (playing pregnant and genuinely pregnant with Bergman's child), yet again hits all the emotive discordant notes of a woman in love but fearful of where both her sanity - and that of her husband - is heading.

As Johan's drawings start to take on disturbing overtones (we don't see them, he narrates to his wife but we get the picture), we then get pulled into Bergman's world of flashbacks and the question of reality or nightmares?. Here the director unleashes his weapons of choice, human demons - grotesques, all cloaked magnificently by cinematographer Nyquist who once again follows his leader down the road of chilly expressionism.

Alma (Ullman) quite early on announces that couples who are together for so long start to resemble each other, so is it any coincidence that as things reach fever pitch Johan is wearing lipstick? Are we to buy into the notion that Sydow's character's under Bergman are in fact his alter egos? Does it matter? No it doesn't, for Bergman is a fascinating director (I personally don't like all his films), what you do come away with is a feeling of being invaded mentally - and joyously so. 8/10",8.0

From literally the first few seconds you know where <em>'The Country Bears'</em> is going, both with the plot but also with the concept of the bears themselves. That's if you didn't already guess from the poster.

On the contrary, where to start with the negatives?! The bears. Having people in costumes is always a bad idea, it cheapens everything else around it. They have little or no emotion, so it's impossible to feel attached to the characters. The dub-like audio for them, and other parts of film, is very poor.

No-one stands out in the cast, with the exception of Christopher Walken (Reed) - but that's only because of Walken's fame, not his role in this.

Add in the dubious take on this part of English history that so irked the historians, and you would be forgiven for thinking that the film is something of a stinker. Not so actually.

It's all just a bit overly-theatrical for me, though - especially the really hammy Hank Azaria who just seems to be trying to do his best Robert Downey Jr impersonation of the menacing Pharaoh. It's really just anther vehicle for Ben Stiller to do what he does best, and if that's what you like then there is nothing to disappoint here - he does all that he needs to.

18373,"The Family Way seems to have had a splashy release for a couple of reasons. It involved a topic rarely dealt with: an unconsummated new marriage, and the debut of Harley Mills in an adult role. I know when I was in the throes of puberty I would have been gobsmacked if I had been allowed to see the naked back of Hayley Mills, whom I had boyishly fancied in her Disney movies. It is a pretty good movie in its own right, not rude or crude in its depiction of what would be treated as a sex comedy nowadays but which received a half-serious treatment back then.  

It takes its time to develop the characters and the main plot. I read a couple of reviews that suggested that John Mills stole every scene he was in, but I didn’t see it that way. He was good, but I thought Hayley owned nearly every scene she was in. She may have been seen as playing herself or the same type as in her older films, but she was serious when she needed to be, and her character’s innocence and sweetness felt real to me and was the secret ingredient to make you care about their problem.  

The only negatives for me involved the brothers. The temporarily impotent young husband had a breakthrough of sorts due to violent feelings that had built up in him. Back then that was no doubt acceptable, but to modern sensibilities having that violence “solve” his problem felt a little worrisome. I also thought the groom’s brother was granted a few too many liberties as he flirted and more or less dated the bride while new hubby was working, but I suppose in a movie without a real villain, tension needs to be built up in other ways.

But I found the movie well worth watching all the way through because of Hayley Mills’ sunny but also layered performance, as well as for the sensitive way it handled its rare subject matter of a virginal wife and what it can do to young love if it is not resolved in time.",8.0

18392,"Like a 90’s Lifetime movie with Alyssa Milano and softcore

RELEASED IN 1995 and directed by Anne Goursaud, ""Embrace of the Vampire” is an erotic drama/romance about a college freshman (Alyssa Milano) who is haunted and seduced by a vampire (Martin Kemp), which transforms her from virginal to darkly sultry.

I thought this was going to be a 90’s version of “Twilight” (2008), but the production quality is of the Lifetime movie level with an emphasis on erotica (softcore). Alyssa obviously wanted to shed her chaste kid-star image from Who’s the Boss and she does so as she’s shown top nude and almost naked on several occasions (I should specify that no one’s genitals are ever shown). Some dreamlike sequences are awkwardly hedonistic and mere excuses for erotic semi-nudity. The film starts weak with an inferior rip-off of the Dracula’s three brides’ seduction of Jonathan Harker in “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992).

As far as the story goes, I like the coming-of-age at college element with Harold Pruett playing the likable beau and Jordan Ladd the prissy biyatch. Charlotte Lewis is on hand as a photographer who’s interested in something more than merely photographing Milano’s character. Meanwhile Jennifer Tilly has a small role as an oversexed pub patron. So there’s some good in this movie that makes it worthwhile but, for me, the good is canceled out by the semi-porn elements.

18392,"Embrace of the Vampire is a teenage wet dream come true for anyone who first felt their loins stirring while watching Who's the Boss. The two stars of this “erotic horror story” (All Movie) are arguably Alyssa Milano's breasts which, like a pair of Norma Desmonds, were ready for their close-up.

If the plot, such as it is, of this movie seems awfully familiar, then let's just say that director Anne Goursaud is mostly known for her work editing Francis Ford Coppola films, including Bram Stoker's Dracula (hintity hint hint).

The nameless villain (a vampire played by Spandau Ballet’s bassist Martin Kemp... so, Kempire?), who apparently lives in the clock tower of an equally nameless university campus, has a small window to seduce Charlotte (Milano): ""In three days I will fall into an eternal sleep."" 

Why three days? This is the number of days until Charlotte's eighteenth birthday, but a cause-and-effect relationship is never established between one event and the other. The eternal sleep thing isn't explained either, but clearly Kempire doesn't want Charlotte as much as he needs her to ""survive"" — which is not a bad thing per se, but then why does the movie invoke the Reincarnation Romance? Anyway, as well as having to remain ""pure"", Charlotte ""must desire [Kempire] before he empt[ies] her life down [his] throat.""

One possible reason for Kempire's urgency is Chris (Harold Pruett), Charlotte's horny boyfriend, but a bigger threat is Sarah (Charlotte Lewis), ""the campus nympho."" According to All Movie, ""To weaken Charlotte's resolve, the vampire plans to introduce the lovely Sarah to the pleasures of lesbianism."" 

That’s dumb even for this movie’s standards. Regardless of whether or not Charlotte would remain pure, I thought the idea was for her to leave Chris for Kempire, not for some random bisexual photographer. Then again, the character of Sarah exists solely to provide some of what Eric Bischoff used to call Hot Lesbian Action.

Interestingly, Kempire is not averse, in order to lure him away from Charlotte, to seduce Chris himself — albeit in the tantalizing shape of Jennifer Tilly. Now, if only Kempire had approached Chris man-to-man, so to speak, that might have offset the gratuitous sapphism.

With all this is going on, Charlotte's grades suffer — for example, she gets a ""D"" in her ""film noir"" midterm (I like to think one of the questions was 'what is the Maltese Falcon made of?') —, which could just as easily be due to Kempire's distracting influence as to the fact that, up to this point, we haven't seen Charlotte (or, for that matter, any other character), attend any classes at all.

An argument in favor of the distraction theory is that Charlotte at some point wears a necklace with an ankh pendant Kempire gave her, an object which, apart from glowing in the dark, supposedly alters the behavior of the person who wears it — which, in Charlotte's case, means different hair, makeup, wearing revealing clothes (though this, ironically, means she’s actually overdressed in these scenes), and flirting with random guys.

All of this raises one question: If Kempire needs Charlotte to not only remain pure, but also give herself to him of her own free will, for what possible reason would he give her a behavior-altering artifact that makes her act like a slut? All things considered, there’s no horror here, nor is there much of a story, but at last they got the erotic part right.",4.0

Suddenly is directed by Lewis Allen and written by Richard Sale. It stars Frank Sinatra, Sterling Hayden, James Gleason, Nancy Gates, Kim Charney and Christopher Dark. Music is by David Raksin and cinematography by Charles G. Clarke.

 

The small American town of Suddenly is gearing up for a pit stop visit by the President of the United States. Unfortunately the President’s visit has attracted the attention of assassins, who hold hostage the Benson family and friends as their home is the perfect viewpoint for a sniper shot at the President…

 

Show me a guy with feelings and I’ll show you a sucker.

 

Sinatra was never comfortable with his role in Suddenly, even before he “requested” it be removed from circulation post the assassination of his friend JFK in 63, there was a feeling within the Sinatra camp that playing such a despicable character would harm his image. More so as it came a year after his Oscar winning performance in From Here to Eternity. Blue Eyes would even try to make good on the characterisation by reversing the roles as it were for The Manchurian Candidate 1962, but of course a lot of things changed after November 22nd 1963. This all gives Suddenly a curiosity value that it actually doesn’t need, for it’s a gripping thriller capable of standing on its own two feet, and it’s boosted by a terrific performance from Sinatra, one of his best in fact.

 

That it was hard to see for quite some time is a shame, because it deserves to be better known. The makers take a hostage scenario and give it a noir edge by way of the conspiracy angle, some paranoia, a family in peril and a strong noir staple of a returning soldier from a war badly scarred by his experiences. In this case John Baron (Sinatra) has the taste for killing, as he is taunted by chief hostage Sheriff “Tod” Shaw (Hayden) about his means and motives, that Baron just likes to kill, Baron repeatedly rants that he was a Silver Star winner, that he killed 27 German soldiers, but this doesn’t hide the fact that he has no compunction about killing the President for money. To him the President is just a mark of no significant interest, Baron is a real cold fish and Sinatra gives a thunderously twitchy coiled spring portrayal.

 

Sinatra is backed up by Hayden doing one of his strong macho type turns, and Gleason scores best of the support actors as a wise old boy who himself was once in the Secret Service. These two bastions of Americana off set the near irritating characterisations of Ellen Benson (Gates) and Peter Benson III (Charney), the former the hysterical female, the latter the annoying kid saying illogical things. However, these two stereotypes don’t harm the picture, because director Allen manages to keep the group under duress dynamic ticking away, smothering it with claustrophobic atmosphere to then unleash all for the explosive finale.

 

It’s set in daylight and visually it’s nothing to get excited about, in fact much of the film is set in one living room, while the patriotism over traitorism is a necessary piece of thematic flag waving. But this comes highly recommended as entertainment as sleepy small town Americana is jolted out of its stupor. 8/10",9.0

Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Sharone Meir.

 

During a family vacation, teenagers Mari (Paxton) and Paige (MacIsaac) are viciously set about by a gang led by recent prison escapee Krug (Dillahunt). When bad weather forces Krug’s car to career off the road, the gang, unbeknownst to them, seek refuge in the vacation home of Mari’s parents. When the parents realise what their new lodgers have done, they begin to enact bloody retribution.

 

It’s pointless going on about remakes of old horror films, they are here to stay and we continue to watch them in the hope that they will strike a chord with us. With The Last House on the Left, remaking it, to me at least, is understandable given the 72 film is not exactly a great classic itself. True enough to say it has that grainy grunginess that was so befitting the decade’s horror movies, marking it out as an unsettling experience without really living up to its “terrifying” reputation. In fact if you put both movies together they still wouldn’t have enough class in them to give Bergman’s movie a run for its money.

 

So the remake then, all glossy and big budgeted, with name actors in the principal roles, it is by definition routinely packaged for the modern day audience. However, that doesn’t take away from the fact that what unfolds on that screen is challenging us, it really does do its job. The pertinent question exists, are you capable of such violence having had violence inflicted on your loved ones previously? What would you do in the same situation that Mari’s parents find themselves in?

 

We have been privy to what was meted out to poor Mari and Paige, and the impact is most distressing. There is good cause to argue that Iliadis and his production team go too far in grabbing our attention in readiness for the “revenge” factor later on. Certainly I myself was uncomfortable watching it, as I was with the I Spit on Your Grave remake, but it’s about getting a prescribed response, however close to the knuckle it is.

 

It’s not a film anyone can feel comfortable about recommending, surely? But I know it put me through a gamut of emotions, even making me feel bad about myself the next day. That is quite often the power of cinema, and clearly the banner that Craven and Iliadis held aloft during the publicity tours for The Last House on the Left. Today I give the film an uneasy 7/10, it’s uncompromising and unapologetically violent, but also laced with flaws. On another day I may find myself rating it considerably lower…",7.0

The deputy who monitors her ankle bracelet (Tim Blake Nelson) becomes infatuated by her. Will the real criminal be discovered and prove her innocence?

“Cherish” is a quirky dramedy/thriller with similarities to Tarantino’s “Jackie Brown” (1997), although not as good. But it ain’t bad and hardly a rip-off. Tunney looks great and has the charisma to pull-off the lead role while Blake Nelson is effective as the besotted officer. The peculiar story, the eccentric characters and the soundtrack keep you entertained. Liz Phair has a small role and is delectable.

A likable conman living in a small trailer on the coast of Malibu (Burt Reynolds) gets the bright idea to form a volleyball team from the exotic dancers who work at a local nightclub called Cloud 9. But what will happen when the girls compete with Olympic level players? D.L. Hughley plays his black “son” and Paul Rodriguez the dubious coach of the team. Meanwhile Angie Everhart and Gabrielle Reece appear as rival players.    

""Cloud 9"" (2006) is an amusing Southern Cal beach flick featuring volley ball and several good-lookin’ ladies. It never set out to be “Gandhi.” Yeah, the humor is often eye-rolling or falls flat, but it is a fun flick and there were three times that I laughed out loud. Despite the attractive females and exotic dancer angle, the movie thankfully avoids raunchiness and delivers a good message. 

My two favorite females in the cast are Katheryn Winnick as Olga and the curvy brunette who plays with Gabrielle Reece. The other volleyball girls include: Marnette Patterson (Crystal), Patricia De Leon (Corazon) and Kenya Moore (Champagne).

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot in Malibu, California.

Elsewhere, you have three of the Disney resident youngsters teaming up in James MacArthur (Fritz), Tommy Kirk (Ernst) and Kevin Corcoran (Francis). They might not be the greatest actors, yet after seeing them in so many other films (together, in Kirk and Corcoran's case) I can't help but like them. Janet Munro (Roberta) is also decent.

18449,"***Melancholic, harsh Peckinpah Western with Keith and O’Hara***  

A former Union soldier, Yellowleg (Brian Keith), vengefully searches for a Confederate who tried to scalp him alive 5 years earlier. After something bad happens in an Arizona town he offers to escort a dance hall woman (Maureen O’Hara) to a ghost town where her former beau was buried. There are a couple problems though: They have to go through Apache territory and two lowlifes accompany them most of the way.

Released in 1961, “The Deadly Companions” has a lot going for it: It stars Keith and the beautiful O'Hara, who had such great chemistry in ""The Parent Trap,” released the very same month. This is Sam Peckinpah's directorial debut in cinema. Most people reading this know that Peckinpah went on to become a highly acclaimed director with notable efforts like ""Ride the High Country"" (1962). In addition, ""The Deadly Companions"" was filmed on location in Arizona (including Old Tucson); you can't beat Arizona for fine, authentic Western locations. Lastly, the picture only runs 90 minutes, so it won't likely wear out its welcome.

The first act is promising, highlighted by a church service in a saloon with O'Hara playing a social outcast amongst the church folk (for legitimate reasons). After a tragedy happens, the tone turns melancholic as the characters take a hard journey through the desert where they fight with each other and the Injuns. The movie’s realistic and harsh, reminiscent of unmemorable Westerns like “The Appaloosa” (1966) and “The Stalking Moon” (1968). “Molly and Lawless John” (1972) was the only one that took this basic approach and made a compelling Western. 

But at least Peckinpah & team tried to do something different, like Brando did with the contemporaneous “One-Eyed Jacks.” The odd classical-meets-Country-and-Western score by Marlin Skiles is notable. At the end of the day “The Deadly Companions” shoots for dark art with a message of maybe redemption but, after the quality first act, never rises above mediocre. And verges on “The Deadly Dull.” 

I kind of liked it, though, but you have to be in a meditative, brooding mood.

18451,"Dating Conan the Barbarian’s creator in the heart of Texas in 1934-1936

Released in 1996, the movie focuses on budding writer Novalyne Price Ellis (Renée Zellweger) and her experiences with famous pulp writer, Robert E. Howard (Vincent D'Onofrio), creator of Conan the barbarian and other characters, like Kull, Solomon Kane and Red Sonya. The events take place in central Texas (Cross Plains and Brownwood) during the last two years of Howard’s life, 1934-1936, and are based on Novalyne’s  memoirs “One Who Walked Alone” and “Day of the Stranger: Further Memories of Robert E. Howard.” Ann Wedgeworth is on hand as Robert’s sickly mother.

Howard’s great imagination and expertise with words made him “the greatest pulp fiction writer in the whole wide world,” as he was known. Unfortunately he died way too young at the age of 30 but, thankfully, he was prolific and so we have a lot of material by him to enjoy. It has always been a mystery to me why this talented man died the way he did, but this film gives life to REH’s last two years and helps the viewer understand what happened.

This is a true-life drama with elements of romance consisting of the simple way of life of a writer, his parents and friends in the plains of central Texas in the mid-30s. Most of the sequences take place at the quaint Howard abode, the theater in Brownwood, the school where Novalyne taught and, mostly, Robert & Novalyne driving the desolate landscapes or walking and talking, sometimes in conflict. In other words, this is a simple drama. The potency comes with the subject matter, Robert E. Howard.  I found the drama gripping as insights emerge in the dialogues and other sequences.

The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes and was shot in the heart of Texas (Austin, Bartlett, Bastrop and Rockne).

18477,"Wes Craven brings us an unlikely sequel to one of his most infamous films. The Hills Have Eyes Part II is a very low-budget survival horror film that is, like many, a victim of studio meddling. The film was written by Craven and had originally been planned to be much longer. However, production was halted after the budget ran out. The film stars Michael Berryman, Kevin Spirtas, John Bloom, Janus Blythe, Tamara Stafford, and a number of acting school graduates. It was filmed in 1983 but didn’t get a release until October 5th, 1984, at the Sitges Film Festival.

A group of young adults ventures into the desert for a motocross event, not far from the location of the first film. Unbeknownst to them, one of their own was once part of the cannibalistic family that inhabits the barren wasteland.

There is some really cool stuff in this movie, but it’s no wonder why Wes Craven wanted to remove his name from the finished product. It’s very disappointing. And kind of a surprise considering this film followed Deadly Blessing and Swamp Thing. Both movies, while not perfect, were far more impressive. But also considering that this is before Craven had blown up with A Nightmare on Elm Street, we can see why studios were hesitant to cough up big bucks. They just didn't have the confidence in old Abe Snake. With a bigger budget, this film might have had blockbuster potential. However, given Craven's admission that he was motivated by money, perhaps its fate was sealed regardless.

The lack of funds had terrible effects on the film, leaving a good portion of it unfinished as Craven went on to work on Nightmare on Elm Street. And, following the success of that feature, the studios granted permission for Craven to finish the rest of The Hills Have Eyes Part II but without any more money or any more filming. Meaning we have a ton of padded-out time using clips from the first film across multiple flashback sequences. And these are full, uncut scenes, not just highlights from the first picture. Infamously, the dog Beast even has a flashback sequence. It's absolutely absurd.

Aside from recycling footage from the first film, composer Harry Manfredini recycles music that was used in Friday the 13th pictures. Everything is just recycled, with a few new elements thrown in, that's about it. I don't know how else to try and sell what we've got going on here. It's not very scary. There aren't very many creative murders or kills. And the pace is extremely slow.

That all being said, this film is undeniably more ambitious than its predecessor, injecting some humor into the mix. Michael Berryman, a friend of RottenPop, gets significantly more screen time and dialogue – these movies are practically showcases for his talent. And not one of us is mad at that. One scene, a hilarious callback to the first film involving Beast the dog and Berryman's character Pluto, is particularly brilliant. The way it mirrors the original is spot-on, and I absolutely loved it. Aside from a few Motocross scenes, this is the best part of the movie.

However, I didn't find myself hating this movie nearly as much as most of the internet does. As stated above, Michael Berryman is awesome and we love his work. The rest of the cast is… alright, I guess. Tamara Stafford is fine. She plays a blind character, so she's working with that poorly. Robert Houston returns from the first movie to have a mental breakdown. And we also get Janus Blythe returning as Ruby. The maniac candlestick family has been whittled down to just about only Pluto Jupiter and newcomer The Reaper Jupiter? A new character who's apparently the older brother of the main antagonist in the first film.

If you've already seen the first movie, then watch this movie just so that you can complete the cycle. It's not necessary viewing, but myself and the rest of the RottenPop crew are a bit of completionists. We need to finish what we start. Even if it hurts. And this one hurts. If you're a Michael Berryman fan like we are, then this is going to be up your alley. If you like weird s***, then take a look at it and see what you think. RottenPop gives this one two stars.",2.0

How strange that those two came together to make two very similar movies so close together. In the end, here, there is enough done to separate them, but early on especially I felt like I was watching the same film almost. For the record, that other release is so vastly better than this... so I'd recommend that more if you want a train-centric production from Scott and Washington.

With all that noted, this 2009 film is still a fairly enjoyable 1hr 40mins or so - despite some questionable editing choices. A big reason for my positive rating is the aforementioned Washington, who gives as good a performance as he always tends to give - which is why he is probably my favourite actor, him or Leonardo DiCaprio anyway.

John Travolta does well though, even if I kept getting <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/face-off/"" rel=""nofollow"">Face/Off</a>'</em> vibes throughout. Here, he made me laugh a few times and the guy has some good dialogue/delivery of said dialogue. Even if that latter element is hit-and-miss elsewhere.

18487,"It’s not really fair comparing this with the much more sophisticated 1974 version of this story as Tony Scott has taken a fairly broad-brush to that template and pretty much re-characterised the whole story. That’s a story about a gang of well organised criminals who plan a daring hijack of a subway train in New York, USA. Their plan is simple enough. They seize one car and then their leader “Ryder” (John Travolta) demands $10 millions within the hour or the bodies will start mounting up. His contact in the control room is “Garber” (Denzel Washington) and soon wheels are in motion to get the cash. What’s not so clear, though, is just what the agenda of these criminals is. It’s not an excessively large sum of money and we know that “Garber” is under investigation for bribery, so is there something more sinister going on here? What is obvious is that these guys mean business and are not afraid to demonstrate that fact! Tony Scott has managed to convey something of the claustrophobic nature of the tunnels well here and Harry Gregson-Williams’s aggressive score also helps build the tension but for me, Travolta just doesn’t deliver anything on the scale of menace I wanted here. Sure, his character is vile and violent but with the story relying on a degree of ambiguity for much of it’s substance, his unsubtle and charm-free performance is all just too one-dimensional to keep the intrigue sustained. Washington, likewise, just doesn’t impose himself on the story anywhere near enough to give us any real sense of panic and the other  supporting efforts are all a bit too underwhelming too, delivering a great deal of wasteful shouty dialogue as this thing rather lumbers along as if it were stuck at the lights, too.

Aside from that this movie is still pretty bad. The main actor has some weird green eyes that glow when he “invokes” them (I guess). I don’t really know, because they don’t explain it, and they show up when he is “more” menacing than he normally is. I also didn’t understand why they had to wear sunglasses towards the end. He could turn his weird green eyes off when he wanted. He didn’t need the sun glasses. 
I also didn’t get why the main character decided he had to quit school to clean up a house. Why wouldn’t you just clean up the house after school??? It didn’t make any sense.

And outside the battles, there is not much suspense either, nor acting possibilites, nor dialogue, let alone character development. Even the technobabble is off.

18519,"**After two films with a lot of good things, this film shows signs of fatigue and wear.**

If I can say that I really enjoyed the first film in this trilogy, I can't say the same for any of the sequels. The first film, even with all the flaws, was quite good and was so enjoyable that it became a milestone for many people's childhood and adolescence. The second film managed to retain many of the first's qualities, but lacked a credible and intelligent script. This film, in turn, is not able to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor and ends up sounding like more of the same, in a tired and worn recipe.

The action of the film takes place several years after the second and first. If for Jesse time passed, for Willy time would pass even faster, since these animals usually have an average lifespan of twenty to twenty-five years in human age. So, if Willy would still be young in the first film, in this film he would be a much more mature animal, and the probability of being able to answer his old partner's call of circus skills would be, to say the least, a house-sized absurdity.

Even so, the script brings the two together again, and this time to face an illegal whaling ship willing to hunt as many orcas as it can, to make good money with them. Keeping what we've been used to since the beginning, the film seeks to raise public awareness of important issues for the preservation of marine life, and this time nothing seems better than showing the cruelty of illegal hunting of whales and other cetaceans. However, the weakness of the film itself somewhat undermines such noble intentions, and I have no doubt that the Chinese would abhor the idea, given that China is one of the rare countries that still sanctions the hunting of these animals.

It is quite evident that the film has lost all the freshness and shine of the first two, and that we also do not have a quality direction that knows how to squeeze the few qualities that still remain in the franchise. And although the villains are quite impressive, the film is predictable, all the material is tired and does not hold our attention. The film is saved, “in extremis”, by the fast pace and by the fact that it doesn't take long to finish.

Back to the usual characters, Jason James Ritcher and August Schellenberg return to be present, but if Ritcher still manages reasonably with the task, Schellenberg seems a shadow of what he was in the previous films, even if it is a return that is more than positive and well-received. coming. With the rest of the previous cast declining the chance of returning, we are left with the positive and interesting addition of Patrick Kalpatrick, who offers us a very satisfactory job. Vincent Berry also deserves a good grade, but there's not much for him to do, really.

Technically, the film continues to bet on good cinematography and the choice of beautiful filming locations. As with its predecessor, it's a film that doesn't look its age: if you watch it without knowing when it was made, you don't give it more than ten years. Good sound effects, good special effects and a realistic animatronic whale are some of the values that the film presents to us. The soundtrack is pleasant, but it's a recycling of previous material.",2.0
18535,"_**Elvis’ first starring role where he plays a rising 50’s rock star**_

A delivery man with musical talent (Presley) is discovered by a publicist (Lizabeth Scott) at a small town festival and joins a traveling band where he increasingly “steals the thunder” of the main guy (Wendell Corey).      

“Loving You” (1957) was Elvis’ second of 31 movies, but it was his debut in the starring role and his first film to establish the ‘Elvis formula.’ Most of the rest of his movies would use this cinematic recipe with Presley’s character being in different occupations, which of course changed the setting and dynamics. For instance, in “Wild in the Country” (1961) he’s a troubled rural youth on probation, in “Blue Hawaii” (1961) he’s a tour guide, in “Kid Galahad” (1962) he’s a boxer, in “Viva Las Vegas” (1964) he’s a race car driver and in “Roustabout” (1964) he’s a carnival worker. 
 
This one was the blueprint for all of those and works well because it’s basically a retelling of Elvis’ own rags-to-riches story and so he’s comfortable playing a rising music star with the challenges thereof.

Everything works except the melodramatic last act, which somewhat lost my interest. Plus the girlfriend (Dolores Hart) is deemphasized and so her relationship with the Presley character isn’t compelling. On the positive side, when he’s frolicking on the farm with her and feeding a horse a sugar cube and singing, there’s a wholesomeness and innocence to treasure. Plus Elvis never looked better, being young and lean.

She then meets a mysterious girl (Jolie) and upon learning of the sexual abuse that Violet (Rosenberg) and Rita put up with (Lewis) from Mr. Buttinger (John Diehl), she along with the other girls decide to rise up and take revenge on him.

  Maddy then learns that the girl's name is Legs and then informs her that their is an abandoned house up the river where she can stay. Then while at school she and the other girls learn that they've been reported for assaulting a teacher. Suspended from school and unable to get her art portfolio Maddy and the girls retreat to the abandoned house. Legs then insists they break into the school and retrieve the portfolio. At first their plan goes smoothly until Goldie (Shimizu) finds a rather unflattering photo of herself, she pulls to the side to smoke a joint but ends up setting off the school's sprinkler system.

  The girls then frantically try to escape the school and evade the police and fireman. They are successful and get back to the house, Legs then decides to commemorate the night by giving herself a tattoo. She then proceeds to brand the others as they sip wine and smoke. The next day Maddy's boyfriend Ethan (Peter Facinelli) is surprised to find that she has assaulted a teacher and gotten a tattoo. The girls then read a letter from another student who reveals she was pursued by Buttinger as well. Later that night the girls are dancing, but their fun is interrupted by the local jocks. Furious that the girls accused and assaulted Mr. Buttinger because he is their coach they threaten the girls. Only for Maddy to tell them to get lost, while Rita flirts with one of the jocks.

  The gang then starts roaming the streets at night, from a skatepark, to sharing a drink to walking on the Brooklyn bridge. Their fun is interrupted by Goldie's dad (Chris Mulkey) who demands she comes home, Legs gets enraged when he smacks her upside the head. Back at the house Legs then tells Maddy she lost her mother and that she has never seen her father since, they have a tender moment and enjoy the night sky. The next day one of the jock's girlfriends asks Maddy for a favor, but then she learns that it was a trap. Just as she is about to be sexually assaulted, Legs shows up and pulls a knife forcing the jocks to let Maddy go. The girls then proceed to hop in the car and take it for a joyride. Legs' reckless driving alerts cops on patrol, she refuses to pull over and the girls end up totaling the car by rolling it. 

  Though not seriously injured they are charged with carjacking, resisting arrest and assault with a deadly weapon. Cindy, the girlfriend lies to the judge and as a result Legs is forced to spend time in a youth correctional center. As the group is separated they start to flounder, Goldie runs away from home and joins a drug house. Cindy then goes back to the courthouse, feeling guilty for what she did and confesses to the judge that she lied. Maddy then learns of Goldie's whereabouts and brings her back to the house/ Legs is then released and makes her way back to the house, but her homecoming celebration is cut short. Maddy shows her Goldie, who is suffering from heroin withdrawal.

  Legs then decides that the only way to get Goldie help is to get money from her father for rehab. Tension rises when he refuses, Legs then picks up a pistol and holds him at gunpoint. The girls then take him hostage and bring him back to the house. Legs gives the gun to Rita to hold, while she thinks about another idea. Maddy then realizes that she is holding Goldie's father for ransom, and then says that she is going about it all wrong. Legs then voices her frustration towards her own father. The girls then decide that he should see Goldie, who walks upstairs and spooks Rita. Rita accidentally fires the gun and it nicks his shoulder.

  Maddy now realizing how dangerous and violent the situation has gotten urges the girls to take Goldie's father to a hospital. The girls then agree, but Maddy notices Legs is missing. She goes to look for her, and finds her thumbing for a ride on the Brooklyn bridge. Maddy approaches her and begs her to stay in Portland, but Legs persuades Maddy to join her on the road. They both make their decision, and Maddy watches as Legs boards a truck and watches it drive off. As Maddy proceeds to climb the bridge, we learn that Goldie and her dad got their relationship worked out. Maddy has gone on to be a successful artist and has traveled around the world. The girls manage to keep in touch, and even though they never saw Legs again they reminisce about the past.

While the movie is critically panned, it was a box office success. It does not deviate from the original novel, it does has some stuff left out. However, the movie takes a creative license approach and I love that they modernized the story. The original story is about New York girls who form a gang in a post World War II New York City. This is easily a story anyone can read and think that it is more suited for modern-day. The movie relies heavily on misandry and feminism, as well as the rape culture. The casting is wonderfully done, Angelina is powerful as the femme-fatale Legs Sadovsky. Hedy Burress is charming as Maddy and the others can hold their own. Legs is the girl Maddy longs to be, while Maddy is the girl Legs needs. Maddy has morals and guidance while Legs is a rebel. One of the best scenes is the nighttime scene with Legs and Maddy on the roof as they watch the night sky.

Overall, if you're a fan of the original novel then this is not for you. But, if you enjoy Indie films and are a fan of Angelina Jolie I highly recommend this movie. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",7.0
18569,"Jimmy Stewart always could pull off the role as the hapless, dewy-eyed fellow; but in this one - despite actually shedding a tear - he struggles to hold this slightly gloopy melodrama together. He portrays a lawyer who falls in love with and impulsively marries Carole Lombard (""Jane"") and they have a baby. Simultaneously, his job prospects take a turn for the worst and they find themselves a bit skint. This puts obvious pressures on their relationship and the film charts their ups and downs. Charles Coburn turns in a good performance as the ""Judge"" and there's quite a tense sequence with Ward Bond/Eddie Quillan flying in to the rescue at the end. I think sometimes we tend to forget that a lot of these films were little more than production-line efforts; so maybe we expect too much by way of distinctive storylines and/or performances. This one is fine, but forgettable.",6.0

Henry Jarrod is a very talented sculptor of wax figures for a museum. But as the museum starts to flounder, Jarrod's partner, Matthew Burke, insists on taking a new direction, a row ensues and Jarrod is knocked unconscious. Burke seizes the opportunity to torch the museum and get the insurance money, with Jarrod still in the premises. Thought long since dead, Jarrod resurfaces, apparently wheel chair bound and with horribly burned hands. Opening up a new museum, his new figures (made by his protégé under his instruction) look ever more lifelike than before, could he be responsible for some despicable crimes in the area?

This marvellous film is a remake of the 1933 chiller, The Mystery Of The Wax Museum, directed by Michael Curtiz. Here this film is taken on by Andre de Toth, originally filmed in 3-D with the then bonus addition of Warner Phonic Sound, it's a picture that thankfully holds up real well even in its basic flat format. The reason it does hold up well is because director de Toth didn't get carried away with the gimmick, it's used sparingly so the narrative never gets lost amongst any trickery, and thus House Of Wax's excellently creepy story comes to the fore.

Having the ever supreme Vincent Price as your leading man (Jarrod) will always help your horror genre picture, and here he two folds the performance brilliantly. At first his Jarrod is charming and carrying a grace about his dedication to his craft, but then, devilment takes control as Price pumps creepy ardour into Jarrod's fractured mind. Quite a turn from Price who most definitely suffered for his art during the shoot, forced to do his own stunts (the 3D process needs more than one camera), he was involved in an accident that set him on fire and almost saw him crushed!Then there was the long and often painful make up sessions to get the desired effects of a burns victim, layers of rubber strangling his skin to the point of passing out, oh yes Vincent earned his money on this one!

We even get one of the earliest credited performances from Charles Bronson (here under his real name of Buchinsky) as Jarrod's assistant Igor, whilst fans of The Addams Family TV series will no doubt enjoy the performance of future Mortica, Carolyn Jones. The film was a big success on its release, and hugely popular with critics, and it's not hard to see why, because today it still stands proud as one of the finest exponents of classic horror, both as a story and as a technical construction. 9/10",9.0

Morton's performance is actually quite good; and her life of drugs, sex and lack of fulfilment may well have been the depiction of a labour of love from director Lynne Ramsey and co-author Liana Dognini, but as a piece of engaging cinema it fails completely. I don't doubt that there are many people for whom this is a manifestation of their psychological difficulties - an inability to form any kind of meaningful relationship - on any level - with anyone else; but it is presented in such a drab, pedestrian fashion that even some grand cinematography of the Balearic scenery does little to lift it from the doldrums.",5.0

An American tank specialist serving in Deutschland (Presley) dreams of running his own nightclub and bets that he can win the favor of a hard-to-get German performer with legs from here to Frankfurt (Juliet Prowse). Robert Ivers is on hand as the protagonist’s soldier pal. 	

“G.I. Blues” (1960) was Elvis’ 5th movie of the 31 in his acting filmography. The highlights here are the German locations, the tank action and Juliet Prowse, especially her two sizzling dance routines.  Letícia Román (Tina) and Sigrid Maier (Marla) are also featured in the feminine department.  

While this is one of the more obscure Presley flicks, it has its own uniqueness and delivers the goods as an entertaining Elvis vehicle.

If they win, well there ought to be enough cash for ""Tulsa"" to go home and own his own nightclub. Thing is though, about five minutes after the bet his pal is posted to Alaska and so he must try to fulfil the wager himself! Initially she's not remotely interested, but yes... it is all that predictable. Elvis fans will probably enjoy this as an expertly staged, choreographed and lit vehicle for a star who doesn't look remotely natural at any stage and who simply cannot mime to his own songs. His regular ""Jordanaires"" get in on the gig too, but most of the renditions of songs like Carl Perkins's timeless ""Blue Suede Shoes"" as well as ""Wooden Heart"" and ""Pocketful of Rainbows"" look like they are episodically shot and inserted into the weakly constructed drama that does, to be fair to Prowse, offer us one glimpse of her dancing skills. This is a very sanitised image of ""The King"" that looks like production line stuff from the most risk averse of marketing departments from end to end. Not great from anyone, sorry.",6.0

A family of hicks from rural Georgia run out of gas on the northwest coast of the Florida peninsula and decide to homestead there. They have to deal with annoying bureaucrats and gangsters who run a mobile gambling ring.  Elvis Presley, Anne Helm, Arthur O'Connell, Simon Oakland and Joanna Moore are all on hand.	

“Follow That Dream” (1962) was Elvis’ 9th movie of the 31 he did. I didn’t like it the first time I saw it because of the (seemingly) eye-rolling premise. Viewing it again after many years, I appreciated it more because (1) I knew it wasn’t supposed to be taken too seriously and (2) the movie, albeit farcical, does reveal interesting data on the concept of homesteading with the corresponding establishment of civilization, government, laws and lawbreaking.

Moreover, the film is an interesting commentary on the naiveté & goodwill of backwoods types in contrast to the corruption of big city people. Of course, “Deliverance” (1972) would change this perception forever, but “Follow That Dream” is closer to reality.        

Anne Helm is easily one of the top females to costar in a Presley flick along with Ann-Margret in “Viva Las Vegas” (1964) and Michele Carey in “Live a Little, Love a Little” (1968). She’s all-around winsome and fills out a pair of jeans exquisitely.     

While the film is overlong at 1 hour, 49 minutes, I didn’t mind. It was shot completely in Florida at Crystal River, Inverness, Yankeetown and Ocala.

18644,"Elvis Noir as Rock N Roll comes to the King Creole.

King Creole is directed by Michael Curtiz and adapted to screenplay by Herbert Baker and Michael V. Gazzo from the novel A Stone for Danny Fisher written by Harold Robbins. It stars Elvis Presley, Carolyn Jones, Walter Matthau, Dolores Hart, Dean Jagger, Vic Morrow, Paul Stewart and Jan Shepard. Music is scored by Walter Scharf and cinematography by Russell Harlan. Plot finds Presley as Danny Fisher, a high school student struggling at school who falls in with the wrong crowd just as family matters of the heart start to take a hold.

He said anybody that disagreed with you got a punch in the mouth. Is that what I brought you up to do, to fight?

The last film Presley made before going off to do his service in the army, King Creole is his best film. It's one of only a small handful that showed the star actually had some acting ability, here he gets a top director to work under and a very tidy cast put along side him for him to respond too. Presley immediately warmed to Curtiz (Casablanca/Mildred Pierce), wilfully doing as he was told by the wily old director, rewarding the film fan with a performance of some merit. Presley would often say it was his personal favourite of his own films, and it's not hard to see why. Though packed with musical numbers, many of them belters as well, the film always stays dramatic, in fact the tunes form part of the narrative, they are not frothy interludes slotted in purely for fan appeasement.

Everything he touches turns to drink.

It's not unreasonable to expect King Creole to be a fun movie, the kind where Elvis flies a plane, speeds around on power boats, or saves the word during a treasure hunt, because the poster art and DVD covers lend you to think that. Honestly, one shows the King with guitar wrapped around him, hips bent and a huge smile on his face, the other has the same Elvis pose but along side him is a smiling beauty bedecked in a banana patterned dress! I mean really, would you think this film is shot in moody black and white, features murders, theft, family upheaval, drunks, knife fights, wasted life and all round dirty tricks? That the King is snarly, aggressive and channelling Jim Stark from Rebel Without a Cause? Because all these things reside within this potent and most agreeable Elvis picture.

Now you know. That's how you get into it.

With the drama relocated from the New York of the novel to Bourbon Street New Orleans, and Danny Fisher changed from a boxer to a singer, atmosphere needed to be tight to the emotionally battered story. And it is, very much so, with Harlan (Ramrod/Riot in Cell Block 11) doing a great job of making The Big Easy come off as The Big Seedy. This is a world of back alleys where hoodlum youths dwell and of wet tinged streets barely lit by gas lamps, many of the night scenes shot here are worthy of film noir status, with a rain sodden mugging sequence truly top of the line. Conversely Curtiz also paints a bustling Orleans picture, with song clubs and street sellers proving to be the heartbeat of the city. It's a twin viewpoint of Orleans that matches other duality themes that drive the narrative forward, because Danny is caught between two girls and two night club owners.

Cast are very good across the board, with Matthau menacing, Morrow weasel like, Jagger and Jones sad and pitiful, Stewart elegantly honest and Hart doing a neat line in confused love. Stand out tunes include the title song, ""Hard Headed Woman"", ""Trouble"", ""Steadfast Loyal and True"", ""Lover Doll"" and the quite beautiful ""As Long As I Have You"". It's not perfect, serious crime goes unpunished, the main motive driving on Matthau's club boss is rather weak and the two love interest girls are written lazily as love sick puppies. Yet this is still a cracker of a movie, where Presley bristles with magnetism and emotional conflict and Curtiz and Harlan rack up the requisite amount of impressive atmospheric visuals. 8/10",8.0
18644,"_**Elvis living on Bourbon St. in New Orleans**_

In New Orleans, Danny Fisher (Presley) fails to graduate high school for the second time and so uses his singing talents at nightclubs to provide for his destitute father and sister. Walter Matthau plays a shady nightclub baron while Carolyn Jones plays his floozy.  

“King Creole” (1958) mixes the Elvis formula with B&W film noir. Despite the name, don’t expect any bayous; the story takes place entirely in and around the Bourbon St. district of New Orleans. 

Touted as one of the best Presley flicks because it’s a relatively dark & serious Big Easy drama meshed with a few of his musical performances, it’s not as compelling or believable as Elvis’ better dramas, like ""Kid Galahad"" (1962) or “Roustabout” (1964) nor as entertaining as his more farcical movies, like “Viva Las Vegas"" (1964).

The story, which came from a book by Harold Robbins, feels contrived. You have rival club owners (one good/one bad, of course) with a “sing for me or else” element and an eye-rolling subplot involving Danny’s father, a pharmacy, back alley toughs and black mail. The B&W photography doesn’t help. Hottie Liliane Montevecchi as the banana showgirl, Forty Nina, is the best part. 

How anyone thinks this is the best Elvis flick is puzzling.

The film is overlong at 1 hour, 56 minutes; it was shot in New Orleans and Paramount Studios, California.

18644,"Holyrood certainly didn't stint on the resources it put into this outing for Elvis. Michael Curtis took the helm and Harold Robbins provided the original novel as we follow the escapades of ""Danny Fisher"". He is a skint college flunkey who takes a job in the eponymous club. His boyish charms and his moves delight the audience, and they also attract the mischievous temptress ""Ronnie"" (Carolyn Jones) - who just happens to be the mistress of the club's dodgy owner ""Maxie"" (Walter Matthau). Dangers looms, but when he realises that there is money to be made with his crooning - for the right people - he finds himself immersed more and more on the wrong side of the tracks. Luckily for him, there is hope of redemption in the form of ""Nellie"" (Dolores Hart). She is a good natured girl who tries to get ""Danny"" to see past his short term life and look to a more honest, positive future. Will his new friends allows either of them that luxury? Easily the best film Presley ever made, in my book. Curtis creates a wonderfully grim and gritty environment for this story of love, lust, greed and ambition to play out. The star himself was a bit old for his role, but still he looks every inch the wayward teen - a sort of mini-Marlon Brando; and the songs - though not his best or most memorable, are worked well into the narrative. Nope, the ending is never in doubt, but there is bags of charisma on offer here from a star who was exactly that.",7.0
18647,"Flashes of greatness standing out in chopped messy Western.

I was never that smitten with this film many years ago on my first viewing, but now, with the advent of time, I like to think I view films with newer and wiser perspectives. Sadly I can't say that One-Eyed Jacks has left me anything other than frustrated and cold with disappointment.

Marlon Brando took over directing duties from Stanley Kubrick after the two giants fell out about the direction the picture was taking, this let Brando loose to shoot for 6 months on a film meant to be wrapped in two. Now this may be the main problem to me because the film is painfully devoid of major fleshing out of the characters, scenes are not expanded and there are obvious gaps due to mass editing cuts. It reads on the screen that our protagonist gets sentenced to 5 years in jail, two seconds later we see a bearded haggard man escaping prison chained to another inmate, next shot he is clean shaved and it seems we have missed some important chat between the two escapists. On it goes throughout the picture, I'm sure that the final elongated cut (rumoured to be between 4 & 6 hours) would have been a joyous experience, but as it is we get a cut down 141 minutes of film that rather outstays it's welcome. And to get through it you really need to believe in patience being a virtue.

Brando of course holds court and is never less than interesting, and at times he sizzles and dominates the screen in the way that Marlon was want to do. But the whole performance has the reek of over indulgence about it. Making it more about the actor than the actual narrative. Along side him, Karl Malden is solid and gruff as the villain of the piece, but Katy Jurado is badly underused and seems like an afterthought to be an important character. Sadly, too, Pina Pellicer struggles to convince in her only American film, but naturally that is not important in the context that she was to take her own life at the woefully young age of 29 (depending on what site you believe as regards age at death). The bright spot here is the cinematography from Charles Lang Jr at the various sites in California, it is simply gorgeous, check out the coastline shots and take it all in. I personally feel that this film is one that Brando fans choose to ignore the major flaws with. His name some how making the end product seem better than it actually is. In its longest form I'm sure it ""could have been a contender"" in the great Western stakes, as it is it remains average and something of an unfulfilling disappointment. 5/10",5.0
18647,"_**One of the GREAT Westerns**_

Dad Longworth (Karl Malden) literally ""takes the money and runs"" as he leaves his young partner in crime, Kid Rio (Marlon Brando), behind to rot in a Mexican prison. Rio escapes 5 years later with only vengeance in mind. He finds Dad in Monterey, California, now a respectable town Sheriff with a Mexican wife (Katy Jurado) and step-daughter, Louisa (Pina Pellicer), living the American Dream on the beautiful Pacific coast. The situation is complicated by Rio's teaming up with two lowlife criminals whose only intent is to rob the town bank (Ben Johnson and Sam Gilman), as well as Rio's romantic dallyings with Louisa. 

""One-Eyed Jacks"" was Brando's only stab at directing and his original cut of the film was twice as long (!). I would love to see this director's cut, which HAS been shown on TV, but this 141-minute cut is fine as is. 

Not only is ""One-Eyed Jacks"" one of the best Westerns of all time, it's also one of Brando's top films. What makes it so great? Several things. Brando is at his most captivating here, but the story is entrancing as well, even though it's more of a slow drama Western than an action/adventure. When the action comes, however, it's quick and realistic.

There are numerous themes running through the long story. One of the major ones is the clash of the misfit with conventional society. Since society is composed of a bunch of conformist misfits, the misfit must learn to conform if s/he wants to fit in and succeed. In other words, if you want to 'make it' in conventional society it's necessary to hide your problematic past & flaws and put on a front of respectability. Dad Longworth has figured this out and he's not about to allow Rio to ruin it for him.

I would like to offer a word of defense for Dad Longworth: Although it was wrong for him to take the money and leave Rio to be captured, one can't help but empathize with him. If he went back for Rio there was a high risk of capture or death. The safest and most promising route was the selfish one. The good thing is that Dad wisely took advantage of this opportunity and made a good life for himself in Monterey. He was obviously sick of his criminal lifestyle and wanted a real life, a real job and real family. He was getting on in years and knew that this may well be his final opportunity, so he took it.

The problem is that one's past always has a way of haunting us or coming back to bite us in the hind end, which is another theme of the film; hence, Rio walks back into Dad's life 5 years later and his American dream is suddenly threatened. Notice Dad's rage when he whips/beats Rio to an inch of his life; he's doing everything in his power to kill the ugly phantoms of his past, which is why he tries to get Rio hung on false charges later in the story.

Another theme is how love is tied to redemption. Both Dad and Rio are criminals, but both desire redemption and a better life. The love of Dad's wife and the Monterey general populace brings this out in Dad, whereas Louisa's love for Rio slowly changes him. Near the end we plainly see that Rio no longer wants to kill anyone, he doesn't even want to see his nemesis; all he wants is to run off with his lady love. If Rio remained the same person he was at the beginning of the story ""One-Eyed Jacks"" wouldn't be half the film it is.

In addition, Dad's love for Katie, his Mexican wife, is what delivered Katie and Louisa ""from the beanfields,"" as Dad puts it.

Love goes hand-in-hand with loyalty or faithfulness. We see this in Rio's likable Mexican sidekick, Chico (Larry Duran).

One of the best qualities of ""Jacks"" is that it's refreshingly realistic. There's no goofiness, unbelievable one-liners, over-the-top action or excruciatingly dated aspects, except for the opening credits & corresponding score. Thankfully, the rest of the film isn't.

""One-Eyed Jacks"" was the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western. For instance, the protagonist is a dyed-in-the-wool ""cool"" anti-hero (like, say, Eastwood). The main difference between ""Jacks"" and most Spaghetti Westerns, however, is that ""Jacks"" has a worthwhile story, which can't be said for most Italo-Westerns; also the anti-hero in ""One-Eyed Jacks"" slowly transforms into a potentially positive member of society.

The film's influence goes well beyond just the Spaghetti Westerns. Take, for instance, the crucifixion-style beating and long restoration. ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982) pretty much ripped-off this entire sequence; Arnold Schwarzenegger even admitted to it.

Pina Pellicer does a notable job as Rio's girlfriend Louisa. Spiritually-speaking, she's incredible. Although she commits a foolish error after getting drunk, on a whole she's the epitome of love, virtue and spirituality. Again, this love is the key factor in someone's metamorphosis.

Unfortunately Pina committed suicide a few years after ""Jacks"" was released. Thankfully we have this film to remember her beauty and virtue.

""Jacks"" was filmed entirely in California with all the coastal sequences photographed on the Monterey Peninsula, including Pebble Beach. This is one of the few Westerns where you'll see the Pacific Ocean (you'll also see it at the beginning of 1954's ""Garden of Evil""). Other locations include Big Sur and Death Valley.

Bill Bixby (Donovan) and Susan Clark (Dusty) team up to strong effect, while Harry Morgan probably gives the best performance as McCoy. The villains are largely forgettable, though Slim Pickens is OK as Stillwell.

Not much more to add in truth, except for acknowledging the nice set design. All in all, the film isn't anything incredible but I'd still very much recommend it.",7.0
18671,"The Real Sex Pistols.

Bart Tare (John Dall) had a fascination with guns from an early age, even getting sent to a reform school at the age of 14 for yet another gun related incident. Back home now as an adult, after a stint in the army, he falls for a sharp-shooting carnival girl called Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins) and promptly joins the act. But after a fall out with the boss, the pair hit the road and turn to a life of crime - with Annie particularly showing a thirst for gun-play.

No doubt inspired by real life outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, ""Deadly Is the Female"" (AKA: Gun Crazy) is as good a ""doomed lovers on the lam"" picture that has ever been made. It may be a ""B"" movie in terms of production, but no doubt about it, this film is stylish, crafty and also very sexy. Directed by the unsung Joseph H. Lewis (""My Name Is Julia Ross/The Big Combo""), it's based on a story written by MacKinlay Kantor that was reworked by Millard Kaufman (AKA: the then blacklisted ""Dalton Trumbo""), into one that links sex and violence whilst simultaneously casting an eye over gun worship and its place in the American way of life. Dall & Cummings looked on the surface an odd pairing, but under Lewis' direction they go together like gun and holster (ahem). He is well spoken, almost elegantly fragile with his musings, yet underneath there is still this twitchy gun fanatic. She is savvy, almost virginal in sexuality, but ultimately she's a wild cat who's practically un-tamable.

The work of Lewis here should not be understated, check out the quite sublime continuous one take bank robbery. While marvel throughout at his long takes, use of angles, deep focus and jerking camera movements - all of which dovetail with our protagonists as they go on their nihilistic journey. But perhaps his master-stoke was with his preparation tactics for his two leads?. Sending them out with permission to improvise, he fired them up with sexual pep talks, and the result, in spite of the inevitable ""code"" restrictions, is a near masterpiece, a true genre highlight, and a film that continues to influence as much as it still entertains. 9/10",9.0
18683,"Willy Russell adapted his own play for this tour de force from Pauline Collins as the bored housewife who spends much of her time at home guzzling wine and talking to the wall before her husband (Bernard Hill) comes home from work for his supper at 6pm prompt! When her friend ""Jane"" (Alison Steadman) wins an holiday on Mykonos for a fortnight, she invites ""Shirley"" to accompany her. She initially dithers but luckily a visit from her rather selfish daughter ""Millandra"" (Tracie Bennett) convinces her to head to the sunshine after all. Her pal doesn't even make it off the plane before she pulls, and so ""Shirley"" is left to her own devices. She quickly finds a replacement for her wall - a rock (not called Hudson) and it begins to look like she has merely substituted a beach for her kitchen at home, especially as the other British tourists who try to adopt her turn out to be twits of the highest order! Then she heads out for a stroll where she happens upon a small seaside bar where she meets the suave, moustachioed ""Costas"" (Tom Conti) and her adventure really begins. This is a very British film, this, I think. The nature of the humour is sarcastic and downbeat - and it is frequently laugh out loud and usually effective. The observational nature of the dialogue - often quite pithily delivered using her inanimate companions - is also enjoyable (and used effectively too by her lonely husband in his bomb-site of a kitchen). Miss Collins got an Oscar nomination for her performance here, and that was well deserved as I left the cinema wondering just how many real middle-aged people come to their senses in their mid-forties and realise that their lives have been lived vicariously and largely passed them by.",7.0
18683,"""Shirley Valentine"" is a hugely entertaining film populated by richly layered and vividly drawn characters and fortunately it successfully manages to completely depart from its small scale theatrical roots to become a genuine motion picture treat. It essentially covers the same basic themes as ""Educating Rita"" (1983) and it is just as successful at doing this the second time around. The central characters of Rita and Shirley are also interesting. The former was about to become stymied by the very life the latter is already wearily trudging through on a daily basis, but they are both women trapped  by the monotonous circumstances of their mundane lives and they desperately want so much more to live for in a world that is rapidly passing them by. They are eager to explore their potential as people after they have solemnly taken stock of their meagre lives so far and asked themselves the important question: ""Am I really doing what I want to?"" and the conclusion they both reach is much the same as for the vast majority of us: ""No, I am not.""",8.0
18684,"_**Elvis travels to the Catskills and becomes a hit boxer**_

An ex-GI (Presley) returns to his rustic home town in upstate New York looking for employment as a mechanic. He's roped into becoming a boxer by a dubious manager-turned-innkeeper (Gig Young) while catching the eye of the man's kid sister (Joan Blackman). With the mentorship of his trainer (Charles Bronson), he quickly becomes the top-drawing champion dubbed Kid Galahad. Then the Mob tries to muscle in on the action. Lola Albright plays the innkeeper's significant other and assistant.

""Kid Galahad"" (1962) was Elvis' 10th film of the 31 he did in his acting oeuvre. I prefer the more serious Elvis flicks, like ""Roustabout"" (1964's ), to the silly farces, like ""Spinout"" (1966), and ""Kid Galahad"" falls into the former bracket.

While boxing is a big part of the plot, don't expect the urban-situated ""Rocky"" films or ""Southpaw"" (2015). What sets ""Kid Galahad"" apart is the setting -- the awesome lodge in the mountains. In the story it's supposed to the Catskills (or maybe the Adirondacks), but it's obvious that the film was shot out West. Regardless, the locations are exemplary. Beyond that, the story is dramatic and compelling, not to mention there's a refreshing sense of warmth between the main characters.

A photographer (Presley) meets a free-spirited eccentric woman (Michele Carey) on the beaches of Malibu and is eventually forced to get two jobs, one for a Playboy-like mag and the other for a conservative advertising firm, both jobs being located in the SAME Los Angeles building. Dick Sargent plays another guy smitten with the mysterious woman.   

“Live a Little, Love a Little” (1968) was Elvis’ 28th movie and he would only do three more before leaving cinema for good. What distinguishes this one is the way it tries to make Elvis’ character more ‘hip’ with the swinging 60s. For example, his love interest propositions him to “make love” within mere minutes after meeting him. Thankfully, the woman offers a somewhat interesting character study for those interested. 

Despite her character’s nuttiness, Michele Carey is actually one of the most voluptuous women to star in an Elvis flick, along with Ann-Margret. There are also a few peripheral women just as beautiful, such as Celeste Yarnall, the woman in white at the groovy party that Greg kisses. Elvis and Celeste incidentally became good friends. They viewed the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. together in his trailer over lunch. Celeste has stressed how warm & loving Elvis was and how he had an intense desire to please people.  

Elvis started to struggle with his weight around this time and had to take diet pills to keep slim; he wasn’t happy about doing musical fluff when he really wanted to do more serious stuff. While he could no longer demand his usual $1 million per movie, he did make $850,000 plus 50% of the profits on this one. Despite all this, Elvis looked bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. He certainly still had his charisma.

Elvis Presley stars as the lead in <em>'Charro!'</em>, a western from 1969. The main point of the premise is a promising one, but the execution of it isn't anything all that interesting. The end events are entertaining, it's just the 60-70 minutes leading up to it are very slow. More needed to be added to the story.

18691,"_**Elvis on a riverboat casino in the 1890s**_

Johnny (Presley) performs on stage with his partner, Frankie (Donna Douglas), on a riverboat casino on the Mississippi River in the 1890s. To improve his luck at gambling, a gypsy woman says he should look for a redhead. When the girlfriend of the casino manager shows up (Nancy Kovack), Johnny feels he needs her to win, which rubs Frankie the wrong way. Harry Morgan plays the piano player while Sue Ane Langdon is on hand as a lonely performer.  

""Frankie and Johnny"" (1966) was Elvis' 20th movie of the 31 in his acting filmography. This one has fallen into obscurity because, while fun and colorful, it doesn’t stand with Presley’s more notable flicks, like “Roustabout” (1964), “Viva Las Vegas” (1964), “Kid Galahad” (1962), “Blue Hawaii” (1961), “Easy Come, Easy Go” (1966) and “Live a Little, Love a Little” (1968).

Presley movies are known for taking the Elvis formula and inserting it into different environments. For instance, in “Roustabout” Elvis is a carnival worker, in “Viva Las Vegas” he’s a racer and in “Kid Galahad” he’s a boxer. So “Frankie and Johnny” is the riverboat casino installment. 

I think what hinders the movie is that it’s entirely set bound and so it has an artificial air, which is augmented by its campy, comedic vibe. In other words, don’t expect the serious drama of “Roustabout” and “Kid Galahad.” Nevertheless, it’s an amusing, colorful flick when you’re in the mood for something light and entertaining. And it’s good to see Nancy Kovack, who’s most famous for playing Nona in the Star Trek episode “A Private Little War” (1968). Donna of course played Elly May Clampett on The Beverly Hillbillies.

A successful racer is generous with his earnings and naïve about his best friend’s handling of his finances (Bill Bixby) when an IRS agent comes sniffing around (Nancy Sinatra).	

“Speedway” (1968) was Elvis’ 27th movie of the 31 in his acting filmography. 

How much you appreciate this one will depend on how much you like stock car racing and Nancy Sinatra. Presley looks his best and has his usual charisma; you wouldn’t know he was taking diet pills at the time to keep his weight down or struggling with his desire to put out more serious films. Nancy doesn’t do much for me physically, but I like her mane and she’s likable enough, plus her singing is great. Meanwhile Elvis and Bixby have great chemistry in their shenanigans.

It’s a fun and serviceable Presley entry highlighted by the swinging 60’s vibe and the generous naiveté of the protagonist, yet “Speedway” doesn’t stand out in Elvis’ oeuvre.

I'm not sure I'd want to be invited to a ""McCorkle"" supper, though - the musical preamble to their Irish stew must have rendered the dish stone cold by the time they actually started to eat it - and that summed up the whole effort, really: it's quite an engaging concept but without much pace, too many over-long set-piece musical routines, and at times it borders on the farcical.

Sgt John M. Stryker is a battle hardened Marine who's job it is to prepare his new charges for the realities of war. With no care for making friends, Stryker does what ever it takes to make these men tough and ready for the Pacific conflicts to come. 

Sands Of Iwo Jima is unashamedly proud in its jingoistic fervour, and rightly so. Iwo Jima, and the now immortal portrait of weary American soldiers hoisting the flag atop Mt. Suribachi, has become a bastion of bravery, a beacon of triumph if you will. So it's no surprise to find Allan Dwan's film has no intention if deviating from boasting its colours, and hooray to that. Here as Stryker we find John Wayne giving a bit more to his character portrayal than merely some beefcake winning the war. Wayne puts depth and sincerity into Stryker, an air of believability shines through as he shows vulnerability, we believe he can win this war with his men, but we also see tenderness and it lifts Sands higher than your average war picture. 

Wise old director Dwan (432 directing credits to his name), weaves the picture together with admirable restraint. Fusing actual newsreel footage with his own tightly handled action sequences, Sands plays out as the tribute and rally call that it has every right to be, even finding place in the film for three of the soldiers who hoisted that now famous flag. Ira Hayes, Rene Gagnon and John Bradley are the three gentlemen to look out for. The rest of the cast don't really have to do much outside of respond to Wayne's two fold performance, but keep an eye out for a fresh faced Richard Jaeckel as Pfc. Frank Flynn, while I personally enjoyed the brief, but important contribution from Julie Bishop as Mary. 

Wayne received a nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards (too bad for him that 49 contained brilliant shows from the winner Broderick Crawford & a bluderbus turn from Gregory Peck), with other nominations going to the Best Story, Editing and Sound categories. Ironically it was a role Wayne didn't fancy doing, but some encouragements from war veterans humbled him into starring.

Cunning Western from a director who had few peers in the genre. Much like other Anthony Mann pictures, The Far Country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery. Both of which play out amongst some of Mann's peccadilloes like honour, integrity, betrayal and of course, death!

The story sees fortune hunting partners Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) travel to Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle. Aware of the blossoming gold-boom, they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a Klondike town. Arriving in Skagway they find self-appointed judge Mr. Gannon (John McIntire) ready to meet out justice to Webster on account of Webster having fractured the law, all be it with honest cause, along the way. In punishment Gannon takes the partners herd from them, but they steal them back and head across the Canadian border to Dawson - with Gannon and his men in hot pursuit. Here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved.

Interesting from start to finish, The Far Country benefits greatly from James Stewart's bubbling (anti) hero in waiting portrayal and Mann's slick direction of the tight Borden Chase script. The cinematography from William H. Daniels is superlative, though not done any favours by current DVD prints, and the film has a few surprises and a ""will he wont he?"" core that's reeling the viewers in.

There are also some decent visual effects with plenty of action, (not so) near misses as Ford allows his three stars to tell this story in a far less jingoistic fashion than some of the more propagandist efforts made to bolster public support during WWII.

""Doppelganger"" (1993) is part spooky mystery and part romcom with some slasher bits. Drew was really cute at 17 during shooting, similar to “Poison Ivy” from the previous year. Meanwhile the story is amusing with a compelling mystery: Does Holly really have an evil doppelganger or is she experiencing multiple personality disorder? Or is something else going on? 

Regrettably, the climax is unlikely (in a Scooby-Doo kind of way) and, then, outlandish (in a Hellraiser kind of way). Writer/director Avi Nesher must’ve asked himself, ""What can I do to totally throw viewers off, a twist that no one sees coming?” Although confusing, I suppose the revelations make sense: Those who abused and manipulated a certain person for their own selfish ends unknowingly caused what is observed.

This Sporting Life is directed by Lindsay Anderson and written by David Storey. It stars Richard Harris, Rachel Roberts, Alan Badel, William Hartnell, Colin Blakely, Vanda Godsell and Anne Cunningham. Music is by Roberto Gerhard and cinematography by Denys Coop.

Frank Machin (Harris) gets the opportunity to utilise his brute strength and angry nature out on the Rugby League field. It looks a match made in sporting heaven as Machin quickly establishes himself as a star in waiting, but off the field he is less successful at life's challenges...

You taking the jam out of someone's sandwich without asking for it?

Pigeon holed as Brit Kitchen Sink Drama or Brit New Wave, This Sporting Life is regardless a very unique and powerful film. It was director Anderson's first full length feature and also Harris' break out performance. What transpires over the course of the two hour plus running time, is a tale of mud, blood and emotionally fractured characters. Set to a grim back drop of a damp Yorkshire city, with coal mines and factories the means of employment, the streets are paved with stone and the terraced houses charred by the soot of the chimney smoke.

Just a big ape on the football field.

This back drop marries up perfectly with Machin's life, where even out on the pitch he comes to understand that he's in a vortex of unfulfillment. There are some bright spots dripped into proceedings, hope dangled like a golden carrot, especially with one beautiful sequence as Frank plays with Margaret's (Roberts) kids, but bleakness is never far away, the story demands that. Margaret is his landlady and object of his brutish desire, she's one of life's warriors but struggling to keep up the good fight. Widowed and still burned by her husband's death, her relationship with Frank is heart aching in its hopelessness. Has the polishing of a pair of boots ever been so sad as it is here?

Harris is a revelation, a tour de force, feral yet anguished, all coiled up in one hulking frame. Roberts, likewise, is terrific, a measured and layered turn that helps to bring the best out of Harris. Around the central pair are a roll call of grand British actors aiding the quality of the production, while Anderson and his editor Peter Taylor use brilliant bold-cut transitions to let the flashback narrative work its magic. From the whack of an arm thundering into Machin's teeth at the beginning of the film, to his punching of a spider on the wall at the end, this is a 1960s British classic of some considerable worth. 9/10",9.0

She's quite a distant widow who keeps a low profile but he's interested in her, despite her dour exterior. Yes, in a physical way - but also because he desperately wants her to start to live again. With his new career comes cash, acclaim and success but there's also an emptiness as he seeks some greater sense of validation or purpose, and as that search proves elusive he descends into a drink fuelled abyss. His boss is the calculating and wealthy ""Weaver"" (Alan Badel) who cares not for the man at all, only for results and he's married to the bored Vanda Godsell who wouldn't mind a little fun with their tough new protégé either. As to the cause of the widow's unhappiness? Well rumours abound as to the cause - accidental or otherwise - of her late husband's death and those seem destined to map out her life - unless she and he can, perhaps, break that cycle of depression and find happiness? It's violent - both in spirit and delivery, and it clearly demonstrates the attitudes supporting a prevailing atmosphere of ""acceptable levels"" of domestic violence as the emotions of love, lust and anger vacillate for control of this immature young man, but it also features a subtle degree of decency and even respect deep down in there, too. There's quite a poignant effort from William Hartnell as his well-meaning but rather ineffectual dad and Colin Blakely also delivers well as his best pal ""Maurice"" who serves as a useful foil for the turbulent ""Frank"" as the story evolves.

""Demon Seed"" (1977) is a techno-thriller that mixes “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968) with “Rosemary’s Baby” (1968), ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" (1970) and “The Stepford Wives” (1975). Unlike “2001” the story is entirely Earth-bound, but the self-conscious supercomputer with a HAL-like voice, the psychedelic visual interludes and the sound effects are straight out of “2001.”

Julie looks great in a challenging role and the cutting edge effects (for that era) hold up. Furthermore, the movie creates a disturbing vibe concerning menacing, out-of-control technology. But the story’s just too one-dimensional with the bulk of it taking place in the couple’s house that Proteus has taken over.

World War II, the North Atlantic, the British Navy desperately tries to sink Germany's prime battleship. The scourge of the seas, The Bismarck. 

Cracker-jack war movie that brings brains and brawn to the party. Instrumentally the pic is concerned with the officers back at headquarters (Moore outstanding), how they try to device a plan to capture and sink The Bismarck. The second guessing of its movements, the attempts to keep a lid on the emotional pains as news filters through about losses in battle, men missing in action, with some personal issues bubbling away to further compound the hot-bed of stress. 

This all makes for a riveting and intelligent backdrop to the scenes out at sea. It's fascinating that as Winston Churchill was demanding that he didn't care how they did it, that they simply must destroy The Bismark, Hitler was sending out birthday greetings and pleasantries to his Naval commanders. The battle scenes are spanking, a mixture of real footage, great model work and superb effects, while the great Christopher Challis photographs it all in screen filling clarity.

18780,"**l like ""Sink the Bismarck!"" enough to have watched it every year or so since its release in theaters in 1960. First on T.V., then VHS and finally DVD about 17 years ago. This is another film, like the ""Battle of the Bulge"", where different (simplified/fictionalized) other than historically correct people, especially English Admiralty and Planners, were used for theatrical effects. I have always enjoyed watching the film, but it is less historically accurate than the ""Pursuit of the Graf Spee"", aka, ""Battle of the River Plate"". For instance, Kriegsmarine Admiral Lutjens wasn't a Nazi and didn't give speeches aboard the Bismarck rallying the German's behind the Nazi cause. In fact, Lutjens, was under investigation, at the time of his death for having Jewish domestics in his household, and Kriegsmarine officers were barred from political affiliations beyond the mandatory ""Loyalty Oath"" to Adolph Hitler, which was part of a deal with the military establishment in exchange for shutting down the S.A. (""Brown Shirts""). Also, the correct, historic Admiralty figures, such as Admiral Tovey, are omitted as to specifics and the actual engagements with the Bismarck have some severe inaccuracies. 

In the end, the Bismarck, whose Superstructure was a flaming wreck, because of 400+ rounds, mostly 16 inch caliber from the Rodney, at close range in the final 2 hours. The Bismarck's rudders, Range Finders, Fire Control radar and internal communications were non-functional by this point and the ship was ordered to scuttle, which only hastened the inevitable, due to progressive flooding. It wasn't a series of Torpedoes fired at the last minute as shown that sunk the Bismarck.

Also, the H.M.S. Hood, was never refitted or rebuilt, the way the other 20+ year old Capital ships were due to the war and the lack of free Dry-dock space. So while the Bismarck and Hood may have appeared equally matched, one was built and designed prior to the lessons learned at Jutland, in late May of 1916, regarding the British vulnerability to plunging fire due to thin deck armor and the Bismarck was the most recent Battleship to have been built, and without the constraints of the Washington or London Treaties which limited displacement and therefore armor. 

Nevertheless, the Bismarck was seriously damaged by several 14"" sells that struck its Bow, from the Prince of Wales, during its engagement with the Hood, and was experiencing ""progressive flooding"" and leaking fuel tanks from the onset. This caused a loss of speed and the ""shipping of green water"" over its forecastle which increasingly reduced its combat effectiveness over time.

It is an interesting movie to watch, but the details and some of the important people were created from 'composite' characters or not accurately presented. Btw, due to ""Blast Damage"" from their own main batteries, the Rodney was damaged permanently as a result of the action and was limited to several bombardments of the Normandy coast (for instance) 3 years later and was used primarily as a base of operations for the British Admiralty. It was on its way to the U.S. for a long overdue major refit when it was recalled due to the Hood's sinking and was never fit for independent operations after the Bismarck action though it wasn't hit (blast damage from own guns).",8.0
18781,"The Connecticut Horror.

Supposedly grounded in truth, The Haunting in Connecticut is a decent little spooker, yet still a pic that has all the pitfalls of other notable films of its ilk. Plot for what it's worth has a family move into a new home, only to find that it has ghosts and ghoulies residing within. But why?

There's good strength in the family dynamic at work here, the eldest son has cancer and is undergoing treatment. Thus he becomes the conduit for the strange happenings, and this as his parents fight impending grief and personal worries. The scares toddle along effectively, atmosphere via camera work and sound effects is perfectly efficient, and the story has enough mystery about it to carry you through to the end.

Unfortunately there's a lot of daft stuff as well, I mean who in their right mind would sleep in a basement room and not force open an adjoining door to see what is in there? It's these ridiculous leaps of faith required that if you are not willing? Then they kill the movie for you. The ending also takes some believing, such is the rampant stench of Hollywood of it all.

Gable is on good form as his character treads a very thin line between reason and obsession and Lancaster works hard to keep himself and the crew under control.

18801,"The Edbrook Haunting.
 

Haunted is directed by Lewis Gilbert, who co-adapts the screenplay with Bob Kellett and Timothy Prager from the novel written by James Herbert. It stars Aidan Quinn, Kate Beckinsale, Anthony Andrews, Alex Lowe, John Gielgud and Anna Massey. Music is by Debbie Wiseman and cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts.

 

Following the accidental death of his twin sister when they were just kids, David Ash (Quinn) has grown up to be a parapsychologist determined to debunk the existence of ghosts. Receiving an invitation from the Mariell family to investigate supernatural activity at their family home, Edbrook House, David accepts and quickly finds his life flipped upside down…

 

It’s from the old fashioned school of horror, a period piece of some worth, but not one for anyone looking to be scared out of their wits. Actually the novel by the late great James Herbert was becalmed when judged by his superb standards, so it really will help any potential first time viewer to go into this expecting a more ethereal chiller than anything else.

 

There’s an air of romanticism constantly hanging in the air, and with Gilbert nodding towards the likes of The Haunting for his scares and Don’t Look Now for the meditation on grief angle, it’s a film of mixed blessings. Also nice to see very good period design for the 1920s setting, while Roberts’ photography skilfully brings beauty to the English countryside and murkier tones for the inner workings of Edbrook House. 

 

Cast are fine, with Quinn and a perky Beckinsale creating good sensual chemistry, and Andrews and Lowe are suitably odd as the clearly off-kilter Mariell brothers. Massey, however, is not challenged by her role and Gilegud is only really filing in for an easy money cameo.  

 

It gets away from itself a little in the final stretch, where it’s not helped by some shoddy effects work, but there’s good value to be had in the picture. With grief, guilt, redemption and incest bubbling away thematically, and the spectral visage of David’s dead sister haunting the edges of the frame, film never lacks for literate effort or a sense of unease. The book is much better, mind. 7/10",7.5
18804,"**A film about idealisms, utopias and harsh realities, which could be much better than it is, but is still good enough to be worth it.**

There are many movies about romance and love in times of war. John Duigan gives us a film about love, but also about hopes for the future, utopias and the way war and human cruelty end it all in an instant. That old story of idealism versus reality. The film is good, but as a drama it is a little inconsistent and does not work from a romantic point of view.

The script begins with the unusual meeting between a young Irish student named Guy and a beautiful and liberal French heiress, Gilda Bessé. They have an affair that, years later, they will resume in Paris, including the young Spanish Mia. The ménage-a-trois ends up when Guy and Mia go to Spain to help the republicans in the Civil War. The defeat in the war and the German invasion of France will later condemn Gilda to a difficult survival, as the lover of an officer of the invading troops... and I really don't want to say more because it would spoil the pleasure of watching the film.

As I said, the movie is good, and it has a good story. The problem is that there's a lot here, and there are several sub-plots that come out of nowhere and end up not resulting in anything: it's the case of the tense relationship between Gilda and her rich father, or what happens to Mia's brother. Very little consistency and dramatic solidity, in a script that seems fragile at various times. I'm even willing to forgive that... but it's hard to ignore the way the film confuses love with sexual horniness. Gilda Bessé seems to be anything but a romantic or passionate young woman, and the relationship between her and her partners is very sexual, but not exactly rosy.

Despite having a pretty good cast, there are only three actors who really deserve a note and highlight. Penélope Cruz is quite believable in her character, but the director doesn't give her anything that really allows the actress to do something really memorable. Her character is cold, a little shy, and the actress has the ability to impress us more. Stuart Townsend does what he can in his character, but he's not ""nerdy"" enough for the character he's been given. He's elegant, he's handsome, but that's about it. He's not even an actor who seems capable of combining beauty and intellect in the same character. This makes me think that he was only cast in the film because he is the husband of the remarkable Charlize Theron who, in fact, is the soul of the film and gives us an extraordinary performance, where beauty, sexuality, drama and suffering are perfectly matched.

Technically, it's a restrained film, standard Hollywood at the time. There are some aspects that were very well-used, such as the original footage of the war, in black and white, and the way in which the sets and costumes were designed and recreated, managing to show the passage of years and the evolution of the characters very well. The soundtrack, however, could be better, while the cinematography seems a little disconnected from the rest of the work.",6.0

18807,"Built By Bullets, Dynamite And Blood Stained Spikes!

 

Kansas Pacific is directed by Ray Nazarro and written by Daniel B. Ullman. It stars Sterling Hayden, Eve Miller, Barton MacLane, Harry Shannon, Tom Fadden and Reed Hadley. A Cinecolor production with music by Albert Sendrey and cinematography by Harry Neumann.

 

 

""In the years preceding the War between the States, `Bleeding Kansas' was split down the middle. Being a border state-and not legally committed to either side-Kansas was almost torn apart by its two equally violent factions.

 

A railroad to the West was being built. To the rapidly forming Confederacy, this line, if completed, could mean the difference between defeat and victory, because it could well become the lifeline for the Union's western military installations. 

 

Some Southern groups therefore, took strong steps to see that the Kansas Pacific did not reach completion. Northern interests, on the other hand, took equally strong steps to see that it did. All of this happened before any formal declaration of war, so neither side was really justified in the acts of total violence which resulted.""

 

It’s a fictionalised account that would surely have the historians frothing at the mouth, but on its own modest terms Kansas Pacific is solid entertainment. It’s 1860 and Hayden is an undercover Army engineer who is sent in to ensure that the railroad is built. Not easy because the construction is plagued by sabotage attacks by Southern Rebels led by William Quantrill (Hadley). 

 

Thus the story follows a familiar path that sees Hayden viewed with suspicion by some, admired by others, and as the sabotage attempts increase in ferocity, so does Hayden’s will to succeed. Some love action comes his way (Miller on dressage duties only), as does the chance for some stoic engine driving. The action is well staged by Nazarro, who oversees dynamite attacks and cannon warfare, and the location photography coupled with the train sequences are most pleasing.

 

Modest for sure, but performed well in the right areas and at 73 minutes in length it barely has time to annoy anyone but the history buffs. 6/10",6.0

I didn't really enjoy <em>'Clash of the Titans'</em> but I didn't dislike it all that much either. The cast do alright, as Sam Worthington sticks out most - the rest kinda merge into one in my memory. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes feel very underused, in fact the parts of the story involving them onscreen didn't do anything for me - Worthington & Co.'s bits are far more watchable.

The special effects aren't the best, including those used for 'the gods'... though Fiennes as Hades looks fine enough. It's mainly the creatures that don't work as well, most notably for the giant scorpions on the wide shots. On that note, I did rate the long, sweeping shots that are used throughout... the music is strong too, I'd even say Ramin Djawadi's work is the best thing about this 2010 flick to be honest.

The fight/stunt scenes are naturally the film's major selling point, but I also enjoyed those onscreen and the score - which comes strong at the end and across the subsequent credits. Chan is good value throughout, though I also rate Kent Cheng's performance in this too - he suited his character well.

A family in Melbourne (Sam Neill & Susan Sarandon) is threatened when a young woman attracts the husband at work (Emily Blunt). But is she really a threat or is the wife just paranoid?   

""Irresistible"" (2006) is a drama/mystery/thriller that throws in bits of “Fatal Attraction” (1987), “Rosemary’s Baby” (1968), “Poison Ivy” (1992), “Single White Female” (1992) and “What Lies Beneath” (2000), but is unique enough to stand on its own. 

The style of the filmmaking took me a little bit of time to acclimate to. I suppose you could criticize it as a Lifetime movie with a bigger budget. But there are several things to appreciate, including some well-done visuals and the inevitable revelations. 

Neill is always effective as the male protagonist. Sarandon is past her physical prime, but still in shape and dramatically effective. As for Blunt, this is one of her earlier roles. So she’s attractively youthful, but too thin; she’d fill out better for “Wind Chill” (2007).

Anyway, off he goes and away we go into an abject farce of a film. This is a great story from Greek myth; it's got the whole gamut of adventure elements from which to pick - so how come Jonathan English has managed to squander such a rich vein and come up with this badly produced, shockingly scripted affair with special effects that were around in the days of ""Blake's 7"" on the television thirty years earlier? Tony Todd has a look of evil for his depiction of the permanently zonked King Deucalion but as for the the rest of the cast - including a tiny cameo from Rutger Hauer as his father ""Cyrnan""; the acting is just plain risible. ""Curse the God... Slay the Beast"" offers us a far more exciting tagline than this delivers - and I am sorry to say that even on television late at night after two bottles of your favourite tipple, the most ardent fans of TH (or the also handsome Lex Shrapnel) are going to be looking for ""Downton Abbey"" repeats on a streamer somewhere.",4.0
18871,"She's got a dead fish where her heart should be.

Ride the Pink Horse is directed by Robert Montgomery and adapted to screenplay by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer from the novel of the same name written by Dorothy B. Hughes. Montgomery also stars and is supported by Wanda Hendrix, Thomas Gomez, Fred Clark, Andrea King and Art Smith. Music is by Frank Skinner and cinematography by Russell Metty.
​
WWII Veteran Lucky Gagin (Montgomery) arrives in San Pablo during Fiesta time with the intention of blackmailing the man responsible for the death of his pal.​

1947 was a super year for film noir as a film making style, it's also a year that still even today hides little nuggets awaiting evaluation by noir fans, Ride the Pink Horse is one such piece. It feels a bit daft to suggest it's under seen, given that Gomez was nominated for a best Supporting Actor Academy Award (deserved as well) and Montgomery had made waves this year with his gimmicky production of The Lady in the Lake, but it does scream out as being little known.​

The title is a curious starting point, it's a reference to the carousel run by Gomez's Pancho character, a title that doesn't exactly scream out that this is a feverish noir, but that is exactly what it is. This is very much a bedfellow for Carol Reed's superb Odd Man Out (also 1947), the air of fatalism hanging heavy throughout, a sort of other wordly vibe that hooks you in and holds you there yearning for the resolution of the tale.

The setting is most interesting, that of a small Mexican town during its annual Fiesta celebrations. Yet as the locals indulge in frivolity and joy, Gagin (and us the viewers) are thrust into a shadowy claustrophobic world. The principal characters are suspiciously drawn, not so much Gagin - who is tough and downbeat and has a clear goal to aim for - but those who line up to hopefully aid him in some way. For the first half of the pic the makers keep the cards close to their chest, it's a nice move that ensures rewards await as the story shifts into a higher gear.​

Psychologically the piece is strong, led by Gagin who was already feeling alienated after the war effort, but now also finds himself in an environment doubly alien to him, an interesting juxtaposition cunning in its placement for character development. Many noir staples shine bright, the main villain with a handicap, potential femme fatale, the macguffin, carnival imagery (the key carousel - gigantic scary looking effigy) and on it goes. 

The look is terrific as Metty (Ivy/Crashout/Touch of Evil) and Montgomery bring much shadow play, the dalliances of slatted shadows and wooden beam crossbars further emphasising the imprisonment of Gagin at this life juncture. Montgomery proves a deft hand at directing a potent scene, here his  piece de resistance is a violent assault shot through the carousel while it is in motion, it's the high point of technical noir work in a film that has a lot of such.

Very well performed in amongst the moral ambiguity, Ride the Pink Horse is very much recommended to those interested in film noir. As a character piece with visual treats, and as a fascinating psychological study, this one score high. 8/10",8.0

There is virtually no dialogue - much of it relying on the quirky Brian Fahey score and the odd mumble that set the standards for many an inaudible television drama being made even now. It does recycle the joke once too often, but it still has a charm about it. The singing opening titles; closing windows to keep out the cold - not that they have any glass in them, and the simplicity of things getting stuck, walloped and wedged is fun for a while, but that simplicity struggles to sustain the humour after the first 15-20 minutes or so.

18882,"_**Deviates too much from the comic and has a boring midsection**_

Marvel Comics' Man-Thing is a mindless, empathic swamp creature that lives in the Everglades. This 2005 film is loosely based on the story ""Cry of the Native"" from the 1973 comic (Adventure Into) Fear #16, which featured the Man-Thing, by writer Steve Gerber and Howland, Ohio's Val Mayerik (artist).

The plot's great: The Seminoles and environmentalists are upset over a developer taking over their precious swamp. A new police chief comes into town and has to deal with the situation, as well as investigate an increasing number of horrifying deaths in the swamp and reports of a ""man-thing"" creature living there.

The swamp sets, cinematography, music, locations (Sydney, Australia, of all places) and cast are all quite good. This is not a Grade-Z movie. As a matter of fact, it was originally intended for theatrical release.

The film has a good mysterious feel to it, in particular the first 30 minutes and final 20 minutes. The vibe, to be expected, is very comic booky, but the material is respected and generally taken seriously, avoiding the rut of camp.

What works best is the ""Man-Thing"" itself; imagine Val Mayerik's rendition of the creature with a bunch of creepy branches & roots sticking out of its back & head and you'd have a pretty good idea of what ol' Manny looks like in this film: He's an 8-foot tall, hulking, and utterly horrifying piece of man-like swamp mass.

Now for what doesn’t work. Although the Man-Thing looks great, which is a cinematic triumph in and of itself, he doesn't appear fully until the last 20 minutes. This would be fine if the story were captivating, like say ""Jaws,"" but it's not. Although the plot's great, the story itself barely holds your attention after the first half hour and is unnecessarily convoluted with pointless characters. The middle-hour is wasted on various people hanging out in the swamp for one dubious reason or another, half of them getting picked off by the creature. I'm sure they did this to show-off the superb swamp sets and lighting, etc., but they forgot the most important part, an interesting story and characters. This makes no sense since Gerber's run on the comic contains a wealth of great material to use for compelling scripts.

Also, the film deviates too far from Man-Thing's original concept. Some new ideas introduced are great, like the way the creature looks and horrifically attacks people, but where's Manny's empathic nature? Where's the ""whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch"" element? And why does Manny kill people indistinguishably? For instance, the creature kills a noble native at one point and later threatens the two protagonists of the story. The Man-Thing never did this in the comics even though he was a mindless creature. In other words, he was a force for good, figuratively representing nature and, more specifically, the swamp. However, this CAN be related to the movie as well, if you think about it.

Some things are sort of faithful to the comics. For instance, Ted Sallis is linked to the creature and I actually like the change in the movie compared to the eye-rolling “super soldier” serum angle of the comics.

For those not in the know, the first Marvel comic featuring the Man-thing beat out DC's Swamp Thing by two months in 1971. To complicate matters, the cover of The Phantom Stranger #14 features a creature that looks suspiciously like Man-Thing (albeit NOT the corresponding story inside the comic) and this issue was released the same month that Man-Thing debuted in Savage Tales #1. In any case, Theodore Sturgeon's similar swamp creature ""It"" appeared in one of his short stories 31 years earlier! The first comic book bog beast, The Heap, appeared two years later in 1942, obviously inspired by Sturgeon's creature.

Let's compare ""Man-Thing"" with the similar ""Swamp-Thing"" from 1982. To be expected, the creature from ""Man-Thing"" absolutely blows away the guy-in-a-rubber-suit in ""Swamp-Thing."" The sets, atmosphere and cinematography of ""Man-Thing"" are also better than ""Swamp-Thing,"" not to mention the vibe's not as goofy. As for the story, I would say they're about equal.

FINAL ANALYSIS: The midsection of ""Man-Thing"" is lethargic and meandering, filled with uninteresting or undeveloped characters, but the film's attributes noted above make it worth checking out if you're into creature-on-the-loose flicks, particularly of the swamp monster variety. On that level it's a decent movie. The greatest part is the creature itself, which is a cinematic triumph, especially if you're a fan of the comic books. But these same fans will be disappointed because the film is a very loose interpretation with an utterly tedious midsection. It's too bad because the potential for greatness was there.

18885,"Let's delve into the rise and fall of the three ninjas franchise. Initially, the original “3 Ninjas” stands out as a remarkable film, even though it may not have received the same critical acclaim as others. It exudes a fun 90s vibe that resonates with many viewers. The characters Rocky, Colt, and Tumtum are engaging, especially in their martial arts pursuits under the guidance of their grandfather, Tanaka. While the film lacks in-depth martial arts training, it still retains a nostalgic charm that endears it to audiences, making it a cult classic worth revisiting.

The sequel, while decent, faced challenges with the recasting of Rocky and Tumtum, disrupting the continuity of the original cast. Despite this, the replacements manage to maintain the film's fun and entertaining essence, although it falls short of its predecessor. The lack of martial arts development persists, but the presence of the grandfather adds continuity to the franchise.

The third installment attempted to reunite the original cast for a nostalgic touch, yet the decision to recast once again puzzled viewers. While incorporating Indian culture and indigenous heroes, the film comes across as cheesy and lacks re-watch value, except for the reunion of the original cast members, notably the grandfather.

The franchise's downfall came with the fourth film, a disastrous attempt featuring Hulk Hogan and a Pamela Anderson look-alike in a money-grabbing amusement park takeover plot. The casting of Tumtum was particularly egregious, leading to a lackluster performance. Rocky and Colt were relegated to side characters, detracting from the essence of the three ninjas. The film's shift towards a villain-centric narrative fighting the FBI was seen as the franchise's lowest point, contributing to its eventual demise and disappearance from the spotlight.",5.0

“Jawbreaker” (1999) is a black comedy high school flick with similarities to “Heathers” (1988), elements of “Carrie” (1976) and influenced “Mean Girls” (2004). It’s unique enough to stand on its own and is arguably on par with “Heathers” and the overrated “Mean Girls,” but it’s not as good as “Carrie” or its excellent sequel, “The Rage: Carrie 2,” which was released the same year.

McGowan is great as the alluring biyatch while Gayheart looks too old for the part at 27 during shooting, not to mention nigh anorexic. Two years after the film’s release, Rebecca hit a Hispanic kid with her car in Los Angeles and killed him, which tripped up her career.

Relieved of his duties as an airline pilot due to amorous activities, Rick Richards (Presley) starts a helicopter business in Hawaii with his Polynesian pal. 	

“Paradise, Hawaiian Style” (1966) was Elvis’ 21st movie of the 31 in his acting filmography. It was the third and last of his three flicks shot in Hawaii, after ""Blue Hawaii"" (1961) and ""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" (1962). While it’s nowhere near as good as “Blue Hawaii” it’s superior IMHO to “Girls! Girls! Girls!”

The vibe is strange in that there’s unnecessary exposition in the first act or so which bogs down the story, but things pick up during the amusing dog sequence and, later, when Rick takes Lani (Marianna Hill) to a remote beach in his helicopter.

Aside from the spectacular Hawaiian cinematography and the King himself, this one’s worthwhile for the three main females, especially Marianna Hill, who’s known for being the most beautiful woman to appear on the original Star Trek in the 1st season episode “Dagger of the Mind,” which debuted the same year as this flick. 

Meanwhile blonde Suzanna Leigh is no slouch in the beauty department as Judy; she has a great bikini scene, which shows off her fitness. Julie Parrish is also on hand as Joanna; she can be observed in the aforementioned dog sequence. Julie played Miss Piper in the 1st season episode of Star Trek “The Menagerie.”

The film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot in Hawaii (O'ahu, Maui, Kaua'I & The Kona Coast), Torrance Airport, California and Paramount Studios, Los Angeles.

18898,"One minute he is telling us about seagulls and sardines, the next he is acting as a glorified counsellor - and that's when he's not helping Manchester United to rule the roost in the English Premier League. Eric is a multi-talented fellow, which is just as well as he has quite a task. It's super-fan ""Eric"" (Steve Evets) who is part of a dyed-in-the-wool group of postmen-fans of the club who lives with his stepsons ""Ryan"" (Gerard Kearns) and ""Jess"" (Stefan Gumbs) who have little respect for the man. Things all start to come to an head when the gullible ""Ryan"" gets himself involved with local hoodlum ""Zac"" (Steve Marsh) who gets him to hide a gun under the floorboards. When this is found some home truths have to be shared between these men - truths that lead to violence, a police raid and then maybe the best example of group participation I've ever seen on screen. It's got many of Ken Loach's usual hallmark views on the typical working class, but they don't take front and centre as prominently as in many of his more political films. This one comes across as more a critique on the dynamics of a family, and a largely male one at that, of community and of the almost tribal attitudes and loyalties that passionate following of a football club can engender. Evets handles his role well, especially in his scenes with his footballing icon that appear shot in such a fashion as to look like they are in the same room, sharing a drink or a cigarette, but also looking like they are not. It's Kearns who steals the show for me, though - his performance is engagingly visceral and at times quite touching. There's some gritty humour to be had here, too, and a little dig at those who gentrified football with their 4x4s and their season tickets at the expense of the ordinary fans. It's blunt and brutal, sensitive, funny and worth a watch.",7.0
18900,"This is one of those stories that really does epitomise the venality and cruelty of man! For the sum of $10,000 allegedly hidden in the safe of the rural ""Clutter"" family, two parolees come up with a plan to relieve them of their cash. ""Dick"" (Scott Wilson) is the architect of their plan. He's a nasty piece of work who is quite capable of manipulating the slightly less outwardly aggressive ""Perry"" (Robert Blake) into raiding the place then absconding for a life in comfort in nearby Mexico. Of course, the best laid plans etc., and pretty soon these two men top a most wanted list and are pursued by the doggedly shrewd cop ""Dewey"" (John Forsythe). It's based around a true story as interpreted by Truman Capote and essentially comes in two chapters. The first establishes the characters and the crime, the second the pursuit and it's consequences - and Richard Brooks adapts the story and directs these two chunks with considerable aplomb. There are also strong performances from the two men whose aspiration becomes desperation in double quick time, but who still struggle to display any semblance of human decency - except, maybe, when collecting refundable glass. There's precious little graphic violence here, but there's plenty of it implied and left to our imagination. Perhaps that's more potently delivered when it's mixed, especially by Blake, with at times a sort of gentleness and consideration - an almost childish style of behaviour. There are plenty of psychological aspects of their persona to evaluate as this progresses and that's as much of interest to ""Dewey"" as it becomes to us. The scoring also adds powerfully to the general menace, as does the frequently mobile and intense photography and at times there's almost a temptation to feel just a little sorry for these obviously flawed men as fate takes it's inevitable steps. Well worth a watch, I'd say - it's a complex analysis of two men with few boundaries.",7.0

He is ""Archie Rice"", a seaside entertainer who has long since passed his use-by date. His quick witted, slightly risqué and smutty humour no longer amuses the theatre audiences who now require much greater sophistication. He can't adapt though - it's in his blood. As he desperately tries to stay one step ahead of the bailiffs and the taxman, he puts his nearest and dearest through a maelstrom of emotions and trauma. It doesn't help his wife ""Phoebe"" (Brenda de Banzie) that he is also a bit of a womaniser - usually with younger girls, too. His long suffering kids ""Jean"" (Joan Plowright) and ""Frank"" (Alan Bates) try to keep things running as they struggle to make ends meet and stay cohesive as a family. Add to these four, a sparing but super contribution from Roger Livesey as his father - another man who made his living treading the boards back in the day, and what we have here is a telling look at a man who just no longer belongs. Olivier, the actor, turns his hand to stand-up, tap dancing, singing - all standard skills that anyone making a living this way would have needed; and he does it really well. None of the theatrical, method style he is so often famed (and criticised) for. Indeed, I think this is the most natural I have ever seen him on film. He seems to be rejoicing in the role - and that's contagious to watch. It's not a bundle of laughs, we are given plenty of opportunity to dislike this rather selfish, narcissist - especially when he is with the excellent Plowright and de Banzie. Although there is an inevitability to the conclusion, I still felt for this family reaching a crossroads, ill-equipped to fit into a society they didn't recognise nor really want to embrace.",7.0
18930,"It's tough to kill someone who's not dependable. 

Murder by Contract is directed by Irving Lerner and written by Ben Simcoe. It stars Vince Edwards, Philip Pine, Michael Granger, Caprice Toriel and Herschel Bernardi. Music is by Perry Botkin and cinematography by Lucien Ballard.

Claude (Edwards) one day decides he's had enough of being a regular Joe earning regular Joe wages. He decides to become a hit man, and after enacting a few clinical kills he works his way into the confidence of the mysterious Mr. Brink. This earns him a ""big hit"" in Los Angeles, where he is to snuff out the main witness in a big upcoming trial. All is going well until he finds out the target is a woman, so where once Claude was calm and assured, he now becomes irritable and irked...

With the help of its appearance on the Columbia Pictures Film Noir Classics DVD set, and a certain Martin Scorsese proclaiming it as one of the biggest influences on his career, Murder by Contract is getting the exposure it so dearly deserves. An odd, even kooky type of noir flavoured picture, it's a film that is like many of the late 50s film noirs that don't have the classic noir look. It's light, airy and set predominantly on the salty sea climes of the West Coast of America. It's with the characters, or in this case mainly the central character, where many of these ""lighter"" shot 50s crime movies get their noir worth. And Murder by Contract is a beaut in that respect.

He doesn't like guns!

For two parts of the running time it's a film oozing a sense of cool. Claude proves to be a calm and methodical protagonist, his dialogue sparkles with intelligence and sophistication, he knows the world and his place within it. Words like existentialism and spare, the latter of which Scorsese uses a lot, are words bandied about frequently in conjunction with Lerner's (City of Fear) movie. Those words signify how much of a great job Lerner and Ballard did, where shot in 7 days with a minimal budget they have crafted a picture of unique quality, where maximum impact is garnered from such minimal space and sequences. Perry Botkin's score also aids the oddness on offer, predominantly electric guitar based, it's a fusion of The Third Man and Zorba the Greek, unsettling and at odds with a hit man based yarn, yet sneakily putting a sense of disquiet into the mix.

I don't like pigs!

It's with the last third where film really comes alive, both physically and psychologically. Once Claude gets to Los Angeles and hooks up with Mr. Brink's men, Marc (Pine) & George (Bernardi), who are babysitting him while he enacts the hit, things change drastically. Marc and George are in turn fascinated and irritated by Claude's calmness, tagging along as Claude takes in the sights, gets a bit of R&R and generally chills out. But then it's revealed that the target is a woman and Claude changes, he become unglued. He tells all that a woman is not dependable, he wants double the money or he's not doing it. It's then where we realise there's Freudian repressions lurking underneath the once icy calm exterior. We recall his outburst upon finding lipstick on a cup, his irritation at the party girl sent to his room for company, again lipstick an issue. There's emotional scars and these are further given a scrape during the finale as Claude desperately tries to finish the job, his repressions leading to classic film noir closure.

18930,"I can't help but think this could have been so much better if only someone had taken a razor blade to the soundtrack. It's repetitive nature really annoyed me after about ten minutes. The story, though, is quite quirky and really centres around just three characters. ""Claude"" (Vince Edwards) is a contract killer - and an extremely efficient one - and his two minders who are supposed to liaise with their ""chief"" and sort out the logistics. All is going well until the latest target - a woman, a witness in an huge crime case - unsettles our otherwise meticulous and unshakable killer. Regrettably, this has been made on a shoestring with a tight turnaround, so we get little - if any - time to play any mind games with our assassin; what is it about killing a woman that troubles him? She's a relatively easy mark - even if she is guarded by the police 24 hours. The end of the film, therefore, feels just a bit rushed and thought there is a clear conclusion, it could have been much better developed and complete. Still, for what it is, it takes quite an innovative approach to a standard plot line and Edwards makes the whole thing certainly worth a watch.",7.0
18937,"Empty watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.

This movie is a good example of Warner Bros' desperate desire to be like Disney instead of doing their own thing when it comes to animation.  It even looks like they lifted a character directly out of ""Alice in Wonderland"", and maybe there was a legal loophole they had , but it was really unnecessary.

Honestly, most of the premise is a lot of nonsense, and I don't mean to dash dreams and lose the fancy of imaginative creation, but it's not even just fun.  They took one of the few popular free stories (King Arthur) that Disney hadn't monopolized (""Sword in the Stone"" only covers Arthur as a child, and this is after Camelot was realized), and then added so much magical guff to it that it was hardly recognizable as a version of the original story.  This is not a ""King Arthur and his Knights"" story, it's a Kayley, and you don't know who that is because they made her up.

Even Cary Elwes (Princess Bride: The Man in Black), by far the best actor /  character in the movie, seems to have impatient disdain for having to perform the role, and he's probably the 3rd most occurring character.

A knight that Arthur never would have made a knight, that the audience doesn't know, traitors the crown (when Lancelot did it, it was impactful) and kills a knight, that the audience doesn't know or care about, so the main character is launch into adventure on a basis that the audience objectively doesn't care about, and that adventure is further preluded with a Griffon dropping Excaliber into a cursed wood (which would have normally been represented by Merlin and/or the Woad), and having some magic would be fine, but they basically rip off the ""Fire Swamp"" from ""Princess Bride"" and add in all these questionably real people with weapons for hands.

The Communist regime in Romania forces Dracula from his castle (George Hamilton), so he and Renfield (Arte Johnson) fly to New York City to meet a model who has caught the Count’s eye (Susan Saint James). Richard Benjamin plays her therapist and Dick Shawn an officer that tries to help solve the vampire happenings.

“Love at First Bite” (1979) spoofs Dracula flicks and was AIP’s most successful film up to that point (an honor that would only last three months, after which “The Amityville Horror” took the crown). It surged Hamilton’s career and remains his most profitable movie. 

If you like other classic monster satires, such as “The Vampire Happening” (1971) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), you should appreciate this one. It puts Dracula in the modern day Big City and milks it for fun. While it’s rarely laugh-out-loud funny, it’s consistently amusing (or eye-rolling) in a quiet smirks kind of way. There are several cameos of celebs that were popular at the time.

Although it has been accused of being “racist,” it pokes fun of people across the board, whatever their skin color or socioeconomic status. For instance, the beginning makes fun of Romanian Communists followed by superstitious rural villagers (all white people).

18971,"**Rosencrantz and Guildenstern must remain in the theater.**

This film is perhaps the proof that not all successful plays are good enough to work in the cinema. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two characters from “Hamlet”, by William Shakespeare, but it is difficult for anyone to remember them without being very knowledgeable about the literary work in question. They really barely matter to the action. Here, they are the main actors, and we are invited, in a way, to see things through their eyes. In theater, this is interesting. In the cinema, and for a general audience that doesn't know “Hamlet” so well, this doesn't seem like a good idea.

Gary Oldman and Tim Roth brought the main roles to life with great panache and value, and the film ends up not being an absolute waste of time thanks to these two magnificent and valuable actors, full of talent. There is a high dose of “nonsense” in the dialogues between the two, and this can become tiring, but it generally works without surprising. The rest of the cast does not have such good material and opportunities to stand out, thus leaving the film somewhat devoid of good characters other than the protagonists.

On a technical level, the emphasis is on the costumes and sets. I can't say that there is great historical rigor here: historically, Hamlet's life is located in Denmark in the Year One Thousand and what we see is Renaissance, much more suited to people and figures who would be contemporary with Shakespeare. But I didn't have any problems with that, and that's not even a problem because all of this is fiction and can be situated in time whenever you want. Much more difficult to bear is the slight feeling that we are watching a kind of recorded play instead of a film.",4.0
18972,"Obviously contrived with the box office in mind, this is an OK western that sees John Wayne (the rough and ready Yankee colonel) and Rock Hudson (the suave, debonaire, but broke, plantation owning Confederate colonel) and their respective ex-soldiers form an uneasy partnership after the US Civil war, to drive some horses to their new owner, Emperor Maximilian of Mexico. En route, they have the usual sequence of ""Red River"" (1948) style escapades before encountering treachery on a fairly grand scale that puts the lives of themselves and their horses at risk. There is a bit of chemistry between the two men, their opposing characters creating the odd spark - and some humour - as their journey progresses. Ben Johnson, Bruce Cabot and a very green looking ""Airwolf"" (Jan-Michael Vincent) chip into the story too, keeping it moving along steadily, if not exactly excitingly. Two hours felt too long - until the last fifteen minutes, not enough happens to keep the interest from dwindling, but it shows why both men were the stars they were, and is still just about worth watching.",6.0
18973,"Jerry Lewis, John Carpenter and The Three Stooges are but three American icons that seem to be underappreciated in their native land.

I watched many of his films, back in the day (though it's hard, three-to-four decades later, figuring out which ones I saw), and loved his work, so I've made a point of getting many of his films from his classic period and checking them out.

I loved his take on the Cinderella fairy tale, and thought it was both hilarious and well-made. It was great seeing two of my favourite character actors, Judith Anderson and an intriguingly-cast Henry Silva, here as well, and seeing the much-and-rightly-lauded 'staircase scene', it was incredible that he did that, since he had suffered so much from back pain at that time (from falling during a show in Las Vegas), and suffered his first heart attack in trying to do it all in one take.

The Three Worlds of Gulliver is produced out of Columbia Pictures and is directed by Jack Sher. It stars Kerwin Matthews as Lemuel Gulliver, June Thorburn as his fiancée Elizabeth, with support coming from Basil Sydney (The Emperor of Lilliput), Grégoire Aslan (King Brob), Mary Ellis (Queen), Charles Lloyd Pack (Prime Minister Makovan) & child actor Sherry Alberoni as Glumdalclitch. Filmed in England and Spain, it features stop-motion animation and special visual effects by Superdynamation genius Ray Harryhausen. Sher & Arthur Ross adapt for the screen with a loose reworking of the 18th-century English novel Gulliver's Travels written by Jonathan Swift. And music maestro Bernard Herrmann provides the score.

Swift's biting satirical novel has been watered down and given a romantic edge for the family market. That said, as the kids are enjoying the froth and tickle, the adults will note that there's just enough caustic comment in the piece to get the message across. This adaptation has slimmed down the four parts of Swift's work to just the two; Lilliput land of the little people and Brobdingnag land of the giants. With our intrepid normal sized hero Gulliver and his stowaway fiancée Elizabeth under threat either way.

While the script has its pleasing moments it is still only serving as a bridging work for Harryhausen's effects to be shown. Be it the giant and tiny people sequences or the perils that come to our undersized protagonists courtesy of a Gator and a Squirrel, it's these that the children will find beguiling. This, however, can not be said for Harryhausen aficionados or adults more accustomed to more modern advancements. For this is bottom rung for Harryhausen, not bad at all, yet although there's a charm here, and no one should ever dismiss the painstaking amount of time it took him to weave it together, the work is creaky and lacking the dynamism so befitting his best work.

Major bonus' come with the swirling and pounding score from Herrmann and the vibrant performance of Matthews. The role of Gulliver was first offered to Danny Kaye, which naturally makes sense given Kaye's previous work on Hans Christian Andersen some years earlier. That it was also offered to Jack Lemmon, though, makes no sense at all. Anyway, Matthews got the gig, and following on from his fine work in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, he laid down a marker in the fantasy adventure genre that secured him fondness from legions of fans throughout the years. A safe, colourful and pleasant enough piece if ultimately not one for most fantasy adventure fans to revisit often. 6/10",6.0

Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter is written and directed by Brian Clemens. It stars Horst Janson, John Cater, John Carson, Caroline Munro, Shane Briant, Lois Daine and Wanda Ventham. Out of Hammer Film Productions, music is by Laurie Johnson and cinematography by Ian Wilson.

 

Swashbuckling vampire slayer Captain Kronos (Janson) answers the call of his friend Dr. Marcus (Carson) to investigate the mysterious goings on in the village of Durward. Young women are being drained of all their youth, left at deaths door old and haggard. Aided by his trusty hunchbacked assistant, Professor Grost (Cater), Kronos’ search for the truth takes him to the Durward family estate…

 

One of the last great Hammer Horror movies, Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter has done well to rise through the decades as a sort of culty camp horror classic. Initial plans were for it to hopefully kick start a series that would see Kronos fighting evil at any given place in time; Doctor Who with a sword and a taste for the ladies if you like. Clemens had some grand ideas for the movie, but was quickly brought down to earth when he was handed the production’s paltry budget. Barely released in Britain with little to no publicity, and this nearly two years after the film had wrapped! Kronos has had to fight more than one battle just to get recognised. Thankfully the advancements in home entertainments have ensured it a deserved place in the upper echelons of Hammer’s output.

 

The film is a collage of genres, part horror, part comedy, part swashbuckler adventure and part saucy seaside postcard romp, but it all works so well in the pursuit of making the audience have a good time. The writing flips the vampire legend away from the norm, infusing the narrative with a new vampyric foe. This crafty sod can operate in the daytime as it drains not blood, but youth! As the genius Professor Grost tells us, there are many types of vampires, and different methods are needed to execute any of them on any given day. So this isn’t a case of Kronos tracking down the guilty and using one of the trusty old methods used on Drac, oh no! Kronos and Grosty have to use trial and error to see what will work for this particular beastie. Wonderful!

 

On his journey Kronos liberates a beauty from the stocks, poor Carla (Munro) was found guilty of dancing on a Sunday, she can count herself lucky it wasn’t a stronger punishment. So cue mucho sexual shenanigans and barely concealed innuendo between the two pretty ones, with suggestive conversations about having each other and some fondling of the sword. Kronos will also waylay bullies, he has no tolerance for meat heads and cuts them down faster than Zorro ever could. This guy is a hero to the common people, an action man of substance and cunning guile, he likes to drink and toke, it’s criminal that he didn’t get his own series or sequels.

 

Under scrutiny the low budget is evident, where bare minimum of set dressing for the interiors and extended exterior shots are a necessity, while you might be surprised to realise there actually isn’t that many people in the story! But Clemens does a marvellous job with what he had to work with, really zipping it along and blending so many genre flavours with consummate ease. It’s a shame this was to be his only film directing effort. He even gets sparky performances from his cast, managing to sexualise Munro without flashing the flesh and turning Janson’s stiffness into one of the film’s assets!

In 1800’s England a former officer & his hunchback companion (Horst Janson & John Cater) are hired to rid a village of a form of vampirism that sucks the youth out of young women. Caroline Munro is on hand as their lovely companion while Shane Briant & Lois Daine play the effete children of the aged Lady Durward (Wanda Ventham).  

Shot in 1972 but not released until 1974, ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"" functions in the same world as Hammer’s Karnstein Trilogy, aka ""The Vampire Lovers"" (1970), ""Lust for a Vampire"" (1971) and ""Twins of Evil"" (1971). Tigon’s “Witchfinder General,” aka “The Conqueror Worm” (1968), is also in the same ballpark. “Captain Kronos” stands with the best of the lot and was intended to be a franchise. Unfortunately, Hammer had entered its decline and there would only be six more Hammer films until their revival three decades later.   

“Captain Kronos” mixes sylvan swashbuckling adventure with mysterious Gothic horror, some inventive vampirism and a bit o’ camp (just a bit). Janson towers as the noble hero while Munro is her usual gorgeous self and Cater is amusing. There are actually several beautiful women (for which Hammer is known). The woodsy locations are exceptional and the Durward manor is sumptuous. Meanwhile the two inn confrontations are compelling. This movie should NOT be as obscure as it is.

Although top billing goes to the pathetically grotesque Lon Chaney as the bell-ringer ""Quasimodo"", I think the plaudits must go to Patsy Ruth Miller as the persecuted gypsy ""Esmerelda"" in this 1923 adaptation of Victor Hugo's story. The score is hauntingly effective as both battle prejudice, jealousy and enmity from high and low society; with plots for revolution against the rather despotic rule of Louis XI never far from the theme. Chaney's make up is not great, even by the standards of the day, and it would not look out of place in a ""Tarzan"" film, but that matters little to the wonderfully evocative efforts from director Wallace Worsley to enshrine this classical story of lust, power and sadness to film, with a narrative that emphasises more of the emotional aspects of the story than many of it's successors.

An utter lesson in theatrical tropes shifted to the screen with brilliant results. Set over the Christmas period, Henry II has called all the family together to the family castle in France, for what proves to be a blindingly sharp game of human chess.

It all centres around a Christmas court for which the Queen is released from her Salisbury house arrest to join the couple's three sons: the ambitious, but sexually ambiguous Richard (Anthony Hopkins), the King's favourite, but pretty weak John (Nigel Terry) and the clever, silent-type, Geoffrey (a lovely, understated, effort from John Castle) at Chinon, where they will also be joined by the young and naive Philippe II, King of France (Timothy Dalton). Director Anthony Harvey now presents us with a stylish and quickly paced illustration of just how this devious, untrustworthy and potentially murderous family were prepared to conspire and manoeuvre to ensure who, eventually, succeed to the English throne. Hepburn and O'Toole have a distinct and effective chemistry between them. She has the best lines, I think, and delivers them with a razor sharp wit - you are never quite certain what either she, or her equally and skilfully manipulative husband are plotting as the sons prove to be pretty selfish, fickle and sometimes quite imbecilic. The film looks great, the sets and costumes are spot on and the whole thing offers an excellent appraisal of the antics of a collection of shrewd 12th century despots.",8.0
18990,"Gorgeous & Creepy Hammer Horror Winner. 

Hammer Film Productions rework some of the classic Universal Studios mummy material to great effect. Directed by Terence Fisher, this is not a remake of the seminal 1932 movie of the same name. Starring Peter Cushing (John Banning), Christopher Lee (Kharis/The Mummy), Raymond Huntley (Joseph Whemple) and Yvonne Furneaux (Isobel Banning/Princess Ananka), the film is written by Jimmy Sangster and was filmed at Bray & Shepperton Studios in England and is photographed in Eastman Color. I mention the latter because Eastman Color has a different hue to it, something that makes this movie all the more affecting as a horror piece.

The plot sees three archaeologists (Stephen & John Banning & Joseph Whemple) desecrate the tomb of Egyptian Princess Ananka. This awakens Kharis, Ananka's blasphemous lover who was buried alive for his unlawful deeds. Taken from the tomb to London by Egyptian priest Mehemet Bey (George Pastell), the three archaeologists find they are being hunted down by the vengeful Kharis. The only salvation may come in the form of Isobel Banning who bears a striking resemblance to Princess Ananka.

This Mummy is adroitly directed by Fisher, his choreography for the action scenes is stunning. Lee's incarnation as the mouldy bandaged one is swifter than most, thus Fisher has him stalking around Victorian England one minute, then the next he's crashing thru doors or windows with brute strength - with murder his (its) only goal. It's a top performance from Lee as he really throws himself into the role, with his dead eyes ominously peering out from gauze swathed sockets sending those little shivers running down the spine. Technically the film belies the budget restrictions that was a staple of Hammer productions. The sets are very impressive with the Egyptian tomb set original and authentic looking, and the swamp based set-up nicely constructed. The latter of which provides two genuine horror classic moments, as first we see the Mummy for the first time as he rises from a foul bubbling bog, and then for the dramatic swampy finale. It's also atmospherically filmed by Fisher, with Jack Asher's photography utilising the Eastman Color to give off a weird elegiac beauty.

This is not about gore, Fisher and the makers wanted to thrive on atmospherics and implication, something they achieve with great rewards. The Mummy would prove to be very successful in Britain and abroad, thus ensuring Hammer would dig up more Mummy's for further screen outings, none of which came close to capturing the look and feel of this first makeover. Crisply put together and with another in the line of great Christopher Lee monster characterisations, this Mummy is essential viewing for the creature feature horror fan. 8/10",8.0
18990,"While falling a bit short of the earlier Frankenstein and Dracula ""reboots"" from Hammer, this one is still quite good, again due to the talents of Fisher, Cushing, and Lee. It's story, while borrowing many elements from the 1940s Universal sequels, is quite good and this is probably the best version of the Kharis character ever filmed. Christopher Lee's interpretation brings an aggressive, monstrous, and emoting mummy, not the slow, lumbering version of the 1940s (apologies to Lon Chaney). A first rate offering from Hammer.",10.0

Mysterious Island is a loose adaptation of Jules Verne's novel of the same name. It's out of Columbia Pictures and was filmed at Shepperton Studios in England with exteriors on the coast of Spain. Directed by Cy Endfield, with Ray Harryhausen working his stop motion genius for the creatures, it stars Michael Craig, Joan Greenwood, Michael Callan, Gary Merrill, Herbert Lom, Beth Rogan, Percy Herbert & Dan Jackson. Bernard Herrmann provides the score.

The plot sees three Union soldiers escaping in a gas balloon from a Confederate prison camp during the American Civil War. Also caught up in the escape is a Confederate rebel and a newspaperman. As they battle the elements they are forced to crash land on some island they think is in the Pacific. Here they encounter giant animals that threaten their survival. Soon two ladies are shipwrecked onto the island too, but the strange animals are not the only thing to worry about, the island volcano is close to eruption and they appear to not be the only humans on the island?

Though something of a lesser light in the pantheon of fantasy adventure films, Mysterious Island, in spite of its flaws, is rather good fun. Dramatically it's OK, with the creatures particularly memorable, but those in search of a science story befitting Jules Verne are in for a let down (though some small science interest does come in the last quarter). This is an out and out desert island survival movie with some Harryhausen kickers. There's a nice group dynamic as soldiers from opposing sides are forced to come together to survive. While the arrival of ""posh stock"" ladies throws up a class distinction issue, that is nice, if not fully exploited.

There's the usual clichés of course, and as much as I enjoyed it as a red blooded man, did they really need to make Beth Rogan's newly made island dress the shortest in the land? And true enough, some of the matte paintings and effects have aged better in our childhood memories than actually on the print of the film. It's nicely photographed by Wilkie Cooper in Eastman Color using the Super-Dynamation process, but the film also suffers in parts for the restoration. For the prints that exist on DVD now are beset by spotting, fading and scratches. While of course the resolution now shows the flaws of the source material that were once never evident.

Still this is a must have film for fantasy adventure enthusiasts.Yes, as with many Harryhausen based movies, the action sequences involving his creations light up an episodic picture. But with giant animals intent on eating our survivors, a Vernian turn of events in the last quarter, Herrmann's brilliant bombastic score and Rogan's dress! Who cares about routine narrative eh? 7/10",7.0
18994,"Pre-Code Adventure Excellence.

The second of the MGM Tarzan movies should be heralded as one of the finest adventure films in cinematic history. A sequel to Tarzan the Ape Man (1932), it brings back Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane respectively, and then runs through scene after scene of pre-code and pre-computer effects excellence.

Plot line is weak, but it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of entertainment things. Basically greedy ivory hunter Martin Arlington (Paul Cavanagh) and Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton as Jane's one time beau who has lost her to Lord of the Apes) travel into the jungle in search of Mutia Escarpment - the elephant burial grounds. Tarzan and Jane arrive on the scene after 20 minutes of film, which is the cue for Jane to make the two Khaki Fatigue wearing lads hot under the collar, and for Tarzan to literally have to fight for his woman - the animals - and his life!

What unfolds in 105 minutes of film is a tale of simmering sexuality, raw animal instincts, brutal battles and some Simian scene stealing. Cedric Gibbons originally directed the picture, well he was there until MGM realised he wasn't up to the task and replaced him with a criminally uncredited Jack Conway, and Conway (The Easiest Way) was just the man to curl the toes of those waiting in the wings at censorship city.

OK! The sexy angle is hard to ignore, and why anyone with a pulse would want to is anyone's guess! O'Sullivan is barely covered and Weismuller is in such fine shape he makes me wish I had never discovered booze and junk food! There is rumble in the jungle as Tarzan and Jane go for a swim, as he blows on her hair to wake her up (oh she sleeps in the raw by the way), and as the city boys revel in getting Jane to once again wear a ""city"" dress. This is just a point of reference to make us aware that the one time city girl has thrown off her sexual inhibitions and gone natural up in the tree tops. And did I mention a sexy silhouette scene? No? Well I have now.

So, casting aside the wonderful eroticism of it all, as an action film it's also superb. The technical tools available in the early 1930s are used to the max here, it matters not about dummies being flung about the place, or that men in monkey suits fill in while Cheetah is off having a smoke! Or even that the back projection work will appear crude to the X-Box generation, this is film making craft that enchanted those film lovers queueing at the theatre to see this back in 1934. Watching it now demands the utmost respect and admiration.

So, get ready for a native army who during their attacks specialise in firing arrows into the heads of the enemy. For Gorilla's who love to use boulders as weapons. For Tarzan to fight a lion, a crocodile and a rhinoceros. Watch in awe as there is Pachyderm Pandemonium, a pride of lions menacing our Jane, classy chimps proving smarter than your average human, and of course there are high grade gymnastics evident as well.

The Hays Code would soon come into play and dilute the Tarzan series, but still being able to see these early MGM Tarzan movies is akin to going to a film museum where only the open minded are invited. Wonderful. 10/10",10.0

Joseph Conrad wrote a characterful story and Ridley Scott makes full use of that with a focused, frequency pithy and entertaining, dialogue and two measured and engaging leading performances with plenty of entertaining swordplay. The supporting cast is as A-list as you're ever likely to get in a non-romantic period drama. Albert Finney and Edward Fox, Tom Conti and an on form Robert Stephens as well Cristina Raines' charming effort as ""Adèle"" contribute well. All are dressed perfectly amidst settings that suit this gritty and battle-worn story perfectly, too. It's a cunningly devised theme, this - it has the obvious storyline, but also takes well aimed swipes at pomposity, the futility of war, and the stupidity of man - all in a manner that resonates cleverly, even now. It was clearly produced on a limited budget, which is apparent from time to time with the continuity (never one of Scott's strong suits) or with some overused extras amongst the soldiers - but, overall, it is a testament to what can be done in a relatively short film, with a good story and cast and some creative leadership behind the camera.",7.0

Is it churlish to complain about overt flag waving in war movies? Or to decry propaganda prose in the same? Back to Bataan is guilty as charged, yet such is the composition of Edward Dmytryk's film, and its focus on a part of the war we rarely have seen on film, it matters not.

We are in 1942, and after the fall of the Philippines to the Japanese, U.S. Army Col. Joseph Madden (John Wayne) stays behind to lead the local guerrilla resistance against the Japanese army. With that synopsis it isn't hard to figure out what sort of pic we are going to get, yet to purely consider this as a macho beefcake movie is a little unfair.

Sure it's bookended by blistering action, as Duke Wayne (very restrained turn actually) and Anthony Quinn cut a swathe through the RKO sound stages, but there's lots of intelligent human interactions here to mark it as being in the least knowing of the campaign.

It often grasps for the sentimental branch, while the racist barbs and portrayal of the Japanese does sting at times. But this is exciting and thoughtful stuff, boosted no end by Dmytryk's sturdy direction and Nicholas Musuraca's monochrome photography (a film noir lovers dream pairing!).

19103,"I believe Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare based films are a great success. I don't mean that they got good reviews and made box office bank. For me, his **HENRY V** was the first time watching Shakespeare I was intrigued and, frankly followed the language and story. His **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING** and his **HAMLET** reinforced my opinion.  I even thought it possible that we would eventually see 37-ish Shakespeare stories enjoyed by modern audiences. While it may still happen, its unlikely to be completely under the directorial eye of Branagh.

Maybe others felt this way, as a new company was formed - _THE SHAKESPEARE FILM company_.  A production company under Branagh dedicated to Shakespeare productions.  The company underperformed considerably with **LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST** and was shuttered after the only slightly more promising follow-up...

> **_AS YOU LIKE IT_**

Duke Senior reigns over a happy community, until his jealous brother banishes the Duke and takes his throne by force.  The story follows the banished king's daughter as she navigates her love for a young farmer while under the gaze of the disapproving uncle.

This film has a high powered cast.  There is another lyrical score by Patrick Doyle.  The cinematography and production design are beautiful. Placing the story in Japan is intriguing. It has a lot going for it.  Yet, it seems muddy and unclear.

The first portion of the film confidently plants Shakespeare's story into a Shogun ruled Japan. Yet, the story seems to meander away from that until only the costuming suggests Japanese influence.  Maybe relocating the story to this cultural environment was a meal not fully cooked.

Bryce Dallas Howard carries the film as a smiling and intelligent Rosalind.  The excellent Alfred Molina is the clown whose scenes contain the only humorous material.  Much of Branagh's Shakespeare community fills in several roles including my favorite, Brian Blessed playing the empathetic banished king and his tyrannical usurping brother.  Depressingly, the usually wonderful Kevin Kline gives a quiet and toothless performance of Jaques which renders him forgotten by the time the credits role. Similarly wasted is Adrian Lester.

Branagh certainly knows how to make money look good on screen.  His approach adapting the bard's work is not as strong or confident as his earliest efforts.  Maybe this says more about the original source, but there are surprising things that have to reflect today's choices. Most obviously, why is the plays most popular _All the world's a stage_ quote is delivered over a soft focus pan of Jaques sitting in the blurred distance.  It is lost and forgotten.

**AS YOU LIKE IT** is leaps better than **LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST**, but not enough to keep the new _Shakespeare Film Company_ alive.

19119,"An artist without an art.  

Night and the City is directed by Jules Dassin and is adapted by Jo Eisinger from the novel written by Gerald Kersh. Starring are Richard Widmark, Gene Tierney, Googie Withers, Hebert Lom, Francis L. Sullivan, Mike Mazurki & Stanislaus Zbyszko. The score is composed by Franz Waxman and Max Greene is the cinematographer. It's shot on location in London, England.

Harry Fabian (Widmark) is a hopeless dreamer, a two-bit hustler who aspires to make it big and never want for money again. Over hearing retired wrestling superstar Gregorius (Zbyszko) bemoaning the fake wrestling bouts put on by his underworld son Kristo (Lom), Fabian hatches a plan to set up his own wrestling empire backed by Gregorius. Thus he be safe from retribution from Kristo and his heavies. That is as long as Fabian does right by Gregorius and doesn't abuse his trust. Things get complicated, though, as Fabian needs money to back the venture, money he hasn't got. So systematically he drags into the equation his girlfriend Mary Bristol (Tierney), club owner Phil Nosseross (Sullivan) and Sullivan's wife, Helen (Withers). Pretty soon things start to spiral out of control.

Night and the City has been called many things, from baroque masterpiece to being a turgid pictorial grotesque! Polar opposite reactions that have now, over time, dovetailed into a majority agreement from film noir purists that it is indeed one special piece of film noir movie making. The film opens in quite an unassuming way as the title sequence brings views of leisurely London, then Dassin does a voice-over telling us that ""The night is tonight, tomorrow night or any night. The city is London."" We then cut to a man on the run, pursued by a person unknown. The man being chased is Harry Fabian, sharply attired in suit and hat, he has left pictorial London and is now running through bomb afflicted London, through murky alleyways. Until sanctuary comes at his girlfriend's tidy flat, the contrast between the two worlds of Harry Fabian neatly marrying American film noir with British kitchen sink-ism.

However, that sanctuary is a rare ray of hope in Dassin's movie, a cunning trick by the makers, for Night and the City is ultimately a dark and brooding picture, one that deals in corruption & paranoia, with a pervading sense of doom hanging heavy like a death warrant issued by some heavy underworld crime lord. The characters in this part of London are mainly blank personalities, cold and calculating, crooked and immoral. That Fabian is only a lesser light, on the lower rung of this seamy ladder, is irrelevant, because he aspires to become just the same, only richer. Duplicity and betrayal are things he's happy to jump in bed with, and we the audience are part of it as we view this story through Fabian's hopeless and oblivious eyes.

Yet the movie, in spite of its uncompromising story, is by turns exciting & pacey, even breath taking, driven by one of the finest scores put down in film noir as Waxman prods and probes with pulse beats and deft ear clangers. With Greene's expressionistic and daring photography blending seamlessly with the mood crafted by director and composer alike. The cast are mostly strong, with Widmark, Zbyszko & Withers actually terrific, the latter involved in a superb wrestling sequence with Mazurki. At times heart pounding, at others wince inducing - if you find yourself holding your breath - then that's OK, it has that effect on many. Tierney was cast as a favour to Darryl Zanuck who was worried about Tierney's mental health at the time. She looks radiant and offers up an interesting counterpoint to all the darkness within the story. Dassin spoke very favourably of her work on the film, saying she was no trouble at all and a consummate professional.

As for Dassin himself? Well he was, thanks to the HUAC outcry, about to be out of work and on the run. He moved to Europe and never worked in America again, he returned from film making exile five years later where he would make the much revered Rififi in France. A truly excellent director, capable of pacing a film to precision and holding an audience in an atmospheric vice like grip. Night and the City is his masterpiece, and as it happens it is also one of film noir's greatest treasures. 10/10",10.0
19119,"Jules Dassin has assembled a top-drawer cast for this thriller.

Of course, the best laid plans never quite work out, and soon his internecine web of lies, deceit and sheer blind optimism have him on the back foot and at the mercy of his business partner ""Nosseross"" (Francis L. Sullivan) amongst others. The writing provides a framework that allows the actors to shine - sparing appearances from Gene Tierney (like Widmark, himself, just a touch fish-out-of water as ostensibly Londoners with an accent from anywhere but) work well, as does Googie Withers, Herbert Lom and the always dependable Sullivan. There is plenty of action, the pace builds well and there is some gripping wrestling action here too. You can't really help but feel a degree of sympathy for ""Fabian"" - try as he might, he just has that certain smell of failure abut him.

The pace is whipcrack, the plot is intense and in Commissioner Lohmann, the villainous 'Goldfinger' (an excellent Gert Fröbe) pulls off a gritty cross between an Ed Asner and a Popeye Doyle-era Gene Hackman. I love how one of the ways Mabuse resorts to do away with pests pays homage to Lang's 'The Testament of Dr. Mabuse' from three decades prior. It certainly made me wary of churches, one-legged men and even laundry workers, for crying out loud, and part of the fear the film brings across is because in the back of our minds, we know this is precisely how the Nazis operated, studying fluoride as a mind-control agent. If there is any negative I got from the film, the Berlin police department (good ol' Lohmann notwithstanding) seemed the most unintelligent and incompetent sleuthing force this side of Inspector Clouseau.

Diggstown (also known as Midnight Sting) is directed by Michael Ritchie and stars James Woods, Louis Gossett Junior, Bruce Dern, Heather Graham, Oliver Platt, a pre-fame James Caviezel and Randall ""Tex"" Cobb. The plot sees Woods as con-man Gabriel Caine, recently out of prison he and his cohort Fitz (Platt), set up a boxing ""sting"" in Diggstown, a hickville place out in Olivair County that is run by egomaniac John Gillon (Dern). The set-up entails Caine's old friend Honey Roy Palmer (Gossett Jr) having to fight, and beat, 10 Diggstown men in one day. As the money goes down and secrets come out, corruption and violence is never far away.

Midnight Sting was one of those film's that came to my attention in the early hours of one morning. I couldn't sleep and turned the TV on out of pure frustration at a lack of sleep. What I didn't know at that time of irksome sleepy annoyance was that I would fall in love with a movie, a love that lasts to this very day. The TV announcer said the name of the movie and that it stars James Woods. Since Woods is always value for money I thought I would give it a go, for the next 98 minutes I laughed out loud, I cringed at some sad moments and I punched the air on more than one occasion. It quickly became one of my favourite movies of all time. On the surface it looks a very simple tale, but it has so much more to offer outside of the excellent fight sequences and some belting one liners. 

Based on Leonard Wise's novel ""The Diggstown Ringers"", the film deals in loyalties, friendships, greed, power, corruption and lies - not to mention small town mentality being under the microscope. It's impeccably acted as well, with the Woods and Gossett play off one of the most engaging duets of the 1990s. The twists within, and there are some corkers, really crown what was already a smart and witty script. It was a film that went largely unnoticed upon its release, and even now in this age of rampant internet usage it appears to still be under seen or sadly forgotten. It of course will not become a personal favourite of all newcomers to it, but just maybe one day if you can't sleep or you are stuck for a rental then you should give it a chance. Because it deserves a chance to at least try to welcome you into its fan club.

**Going Overboard** tries its best to seem like a comedy, and this is probably its main weakness. The Room with Tommy Wiseau, which is similar in many aspects, became a cult movie because of how badly it was made, but The Room is a drama. The badness of the plot conflicts and the broken tension became the foundation for the audience's mocking pleasure.

Time has been good to this one. The indispensable 70s movie book King of the B's: Working Within the Hollywood System has a fascinating piece on the film in an article written in 1974 by Clive T. Miller. 

He writes: 
""Nightmare Alley (1947) is the quintessential B movie spoiled by an A production. If the studio, Twentieth Century-Fox, had left well enough alone, Nightmare Alley would have be hard and nasty. Or if they had turned it into a full-fledged A project, it would have become a classic.""
Not true anymore. The film is a classic. And a damned good film noir. 

Now, I know, the book is something completely different. It's an insane, hard-boiled piece of brilliance. I read it on a Kindle but it would have been better if I found an old water-stained, moldy-smelling dog-eared paperback. It's the ultimate pulp. 

The book isn't a tale of sin and redemption. It's about the ""folly of faith and the cunning of those who follow it"" (quoting Miller here). It's about the dangers of drinking -- and ultimately the terrors of delirium tremens. 

The book is broken up into 22 sections -- all named after the cards of the tarot. It's clear that the writer -- William Lindsay Gresham -- was both a believer of the tarots and a drinker. You can smell the alcohol on his breath when you read it.  The writer had a short life and not much success after Nightmare Alley.  He killed himself at the age of 53, in a Times Square hotel.  A printed business card on him read: NO ADDRESS, NO PHONE, RETIRED, NO BUSINESS, NO MONEY.

When released, Gresham's book was praised and successful, but it was also damned, sometimes banned and -- in most prints -- heavily censored. 

It was quickly gobbled up by Hollywood -- without anyone actually reading it. George Jessel, the self-styled ""nation's foremost toastmaster"" and producer, read a review (again, didn't actually crack the book) of the novel and convinced Darryl Zanuck to buy it. Jessel: 
""When Darryl got around to reading the book itself, he said: ""You so-and-so, you never even read the book, it's full of censorable stuff."" 

I admitted it, but the censorable stuff was not the picture I wanted to make. I was interested in the store of a carnival barker who found he could hypnotize a few hicks, decided to become a fake spiritualist, mocked the Deity and got punished for his impudence.""
And so the movie got made. But how did Tyrone Power get involved? The often-told story is this was a pet project that he insisted on making. It was even repeated recently by Stuart Gordon on Trailers From Hell. 
Sorry, but I don't think that's the case. Power was between films and the one they wanted to put out that year Captain from Castile, got it's release date pushed back from fall of '47 to early '48 and the studio didn't want their bankable star off the screen for that long, so they cast him in Nightmare Alley. I suspect that they leaked the story about Power insisting on making it to cover their asses if the film failed. The film was a risk -- Power was known for splashy A color period films. 

Power previous film, The Razor's Edge came out Christmastime of 46 and, at least in studio bosses minds, the roles in Nightmare Alley and the successful Razor's Edge were similar (Honestly, did anyone read the two books?) Philip Scheuer of the LA Times found Power ""more convincing as a phony spiritualist that he was as the real thing in Razor's Edge."" 

Nightmare Alley does end up working in the end, despite a director, star and producer that weren't known for dark movies. The ending is a cop-out but the con man and geek stuff is just fascinating. It reminds me of another botched attempt at making a novel about a soothsayer into a film. Edward G. Robinson in Night Has a Thousand Eyes. The Woolrich novel shows how God-awful knowing the future would be, but the movie turns into (an admittedly satisfying) a simple mystery who-done-it. Both the novel and movie good in their own ways. 

For Nightmare Alley credit has to be given to the star Power who's outstanding, and an amazing supporting cast (you can read more about it in our previous NOTW). Power didn't make any other films considered noir.  He was great in this but he really didn't fit the noir mold. 

For a time it was though that this film never was as good as it could have been. Like Stuart Gordon, I'm amazed it was even made at all! And that it turned out to be so good film despite it not being at all what the novel is. 

I wonder if the film was made today would it be truer to the source? A recent graphic novel by Spain Rodriguez (the underground comic artist died in 2012) makes me think the could possibly do it. But can you guarantee me they'll actually read the novel first?",8.0

He starts out working as a general factotum with a travelling show where he meets ""Zeena"" (Joan Blondell). She is part of the mind-reading act with ""Bruno"" (Mike Mazurki) - a man who hits the bottle just once too often. She begins to teach him the tricks of their trade and soon they are the toast of society - fleecing the green and the gullible. It is at one such show that he alights on ""Ruth"" (Helen Walker) - a professional psychiatrist who is not averse to a little bribery and corruption herself. Soon she is feeding him confidential information that enables ""Stan"" to try to trick the mourning millionaire ""Ezra Grindle"" (Taylor Holmes) out of $150,000. Edmund Goulding has created a very well paced, frequently enthralling adaptation of Gresham's novel - we are shown the tough, gritty and frequently violent life on the road faced by the circus folks and all too readily understand why these two want to escape that routine. It is also good to see Power playing a meatier, almost sociopath role, and he works well with both Blondell and Walker treading his tightrope that sees him pretty much abandon all semblance of human decency. The ending seemed oddly fitting - and I think this is well worth a watch.",7.0

The Homme Fatale in Sudden Fear 

“See, I’m not the kind of man who can live on his wife’s money.”


We’re twenty-four minutes into the film Sudden Fear when we realize that the main male character, actor Lester Blaine played by Jack Palance is rotten, and it’s this knowledge that acts as a suspense builder in this taut noir film—a tale of greed, adultery and murder. Up to this point, we’ve just suspected Lester’s intentions, but now our doubts are proved correct. Sudden Fear, a woman-in-jeopardy noir with Joan Crawford playing heiress, Myra Hudson—is the tale of a woman who may meet a foul end at the hands of her deceptive, less-than-loving husband, Lester. For a large chunk of the action, Myra is oblivious to her husband’s evil intentions, but since the plot lets the audience in on the threat, we are committed to the suspense from the start. As spectators, we know that Myra is in danger, and so we are riveted to Lester’s devious plan to rid himself of a wife he so obviously loathes. 

Sudden Fear based on a novel by Edna Sherry, brought Crawford her third and final Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Directed by David Miller this 1952 film was the first picture Crawford made for RKO after asking to be released from her Warner Bros. contract. Crawford hated her last Warner Brothers film--This Woman is Dangerous. The film cast her in a rather spongy, implausible role as a female gangster who loses her eyesight and then turns soft and weepy when faced with a possible future as a happy little housewife. For noir fans, Sudden Fear showcases Crawford in one of her most powerful roles. 




When Sudden Fear begins, wealthy playwright Myra Hudson is in New York casting for her new play. Lester Blaine lands the part of the leading man, but during rehearsals, Myra finds him lacking as a romantic hero. She abruptly, publicly, and rather callously fires him on the spot. Myra’s advisors think she’s making a mistake, but since Myra always gets her way, a disgruntled and bitter Lester exits the stage. 

Myra’s play is a raging success, and she’s due to return home to San Francisco by train. Is it coincidence that Lester Blaine just happens to turn up as a passenger on the same train? Myra seems to think so, but in light of Lester’s humiliation, somehow, his statement that he has no hard feelings towards Myra just doesn’t feel right. On the train journey to San Francisco, Lester entertains and woos Myra, and by the time they reach their destination, Myra is in love. Lester seems to be the perfect lover, and he certainly has perfected the symptoms of an enamored man. He’s attentive, sensitive and gentle, and Myra, who’s smitten by the romance, seems oblivious to the differences in their ages and social status. 

Myra may be swept along with Lester Blaine’s smooth style, but for audience members, that niggling doubt remains. At this point, however, Lester’s game may be mean-spirited revenge, or perhaps he’s a pathetic loser after her money. But one brilliantly constructed scene clarifies Lester’s manipulation and Myra’s vulnerability. Lester fails to show up for an evening at Myra’s splendid home, and Myra ditches her guests to seek out her missing beau. While she dashes to his hotel, we see Lester pacing back and forth, waiting only for Myra’s arrival to begin a performance that involves his pride, a suitcase and a one-way trip back to New York. It’s with this scene and its clever camera shots that Lester is revealed as the center of power in the relationship, less-than-sincere and dangerously manipulative in his professions of love. 

After we become aware of Lester’s true intentions, the suspense moves away from the question of what Lester is capable of to when and how Myra will have an “accident.” The plot plays with scenes at Myra’s gorgeous coastal cliff top home. The steep stairway to the ocean, carved into rock offers the perfect location for a nasty accident. Since the audience knows that Lester has evil intentions towards his wealthy wife, we are riveted to Myra’s nimble walk (in high heels) down the rocky staircase. We can wince all we want at the spectacle of Myra’s potential danger, but we are powerless to warn her. 

Another clever device used as a suspense builder by the film is the use of Myra’s recording machine. The plot reveals this nifty little piece of technology early in the film—along with a demonstration of its abilities. The machine is a crucial part of the plot, but as it turns out, machinery may be relied on for its usefulness, but it’s still subject to the vagaries of human emotion. 

The plot thickens when tarty, brash Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame, one of my all-time favorite noir stars) arrives on the scene as Lester’s vicious love interest. Irene hasn’t been invited to San Francisco, but she wheedles her way into Myra’s exclusive set nonetheless. Greedy and amoral, she accelerates Lester’s desire for wealth, and together they make a lethal combination of lust, violence and murderous design. Clever camera shots of reflected images in mirrors reveal the main characters’ true emotions—Myra’s lawyer’s distrust of Lester, Irene planning murder, Lester’s mask of loving, doting husband suspended, and Myra horrified by just how far she’ll go. 

The film’s plot is as well rounded as a Greek tragedy, with just desserts for those who concoct evil ends for others. But it’s the delivery of those just desserts that makes for riveting viewing. The city of San Francisco assumes a spectacular role in Sudden Fear. The film includes great shots of the city, and it’s played here as both an ambivalent setting for nefarious actions, and also as a rat’s maze in the frenzied, final action-packed scenes. The city’s inanimate beauty serves to highlight urban indifference to its inhabitants’ actions.


Sudden Fear gives Crawford a terrific role and gives her the chance to act her heart out. Here she’s the tough, cold businesswoman who melts with Lester’s continued interest. Weakened by emotion and threatened by violence, she spends one hysterical terror-filled night in the shifting shadows of her bedroom before going on the offensive in the no-one-fucks-with-Joan role fans love so much. The fact that Myra is a successful playwright is artfully weaved into the story when she imagines she can write her way out of a real-life problem just as she would write a script for one of her plays. Myra’s attempt to script her own life is seen in a series of imagined flash-forward sequences. Unfortunately, since she is dealing with real people and not fictional characters, there’s an element of unpredictability that even Myra can’t anticipate. Just as the timing in a play must be precision perfect, Myra’s scheme also relies on split second sequencing. The film uses the ticking of a clock to emphasize the crucial timing involved in Myra’s plan. The clock ticks away like a metronome with the action and nerve-wracking suspense building to a frenzied, orgasmic, and deadly conclusion.

19171,"You know what happened to Nietzsche? 

Sudden Fear is directed by David Miller and adapted to screenplay by Lenore J. Coffee and Robert Smith from the novel written by Edna Sherry. It stars Joan Crawford, Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Charles Lang Jr. 

""Miss Hudson, in your own native city of San Francisco, there's an art gallery in the Legion of Honor in which there's an oil painting of Casanova. It's quite obvious that you have never seen this painting. For your information, Miss Hudson, this is what Casanova looked like. He had big ears, a scar over one eye, a broken nose, and a wart on his chin, right here. I suggest, Miss Hudson, that when you return to San Francisco, you visit this gallery and see this painting!"" 

The above is the response Lester Blaine (Palance) gives to Broadway playwright Myra Hudson (Crawford) who has just rejected him for the lead role in her latest play on account of his looks. Later that day the pair meet up on a train heading for Frisco and Myra is swept off of her feet. They court and marry, but once finances come into play and Irene Neves (Grahame) arrives on the scene, something far more sinister begins to rear its head 

It takes a while to get going, but once Sudden Fear hits its stride it's a suspenseful noirish delight. Filmed on locations in San Francisco and with Lang Junior bringing the chiaroscuro and Miller dabbling in deftly placed shadows and tracking cameras, there's a visuality that's vital to the edgy atmosphere of the story. It's pretty obvious quite early on what is happening in the plotting but this never affects the suspense, Miller builds it slowly and then unleashes the chills at the midpoint, garnering top performances from the three principal players in the process. It's ready made material for Crawford, where she gets to run through her repertoire of female emotions, while Palance enjoys playing the villain and Grahame slinks in to view in the way that only she can. 

Some trimming of the running time wouldn't have gone amiss, and some of Myra's stamina powers in the final quarter stretch the faith a touch, but all told it's a very good ""woman in peril"" noir that is crowned by a terrifically exciting ending. 7.5/10",7.0

Soon we discover that Palance has been in cahoots with girlfriend Gloria Grahame and they have desires on his new wife's considerable fortune.

It was a compromised production, with director Tom Savini announcing that the finished cut is not half the film he set out to make. Surprising, then, to find it still works to the point of being viable. It's a very effective zombie pic, one performed with quality by the cast, with the concept of a group of people holed up in a house - under intense attack by the walking dead - still terrifying. It helps to cast Tony Todd in a reimaging of a horror classic, while Patricia Tallman is a fine spunky lead lady horror protag.

Group dynamics again explode, heroes and villains are born, and the creatures are high grade in scary construction. Caveat, though, is that although it's a faithul(ish) remake, where with the new tools to hand it's understandable why the makers thought they could create another horror classic, but one for the 90s horror hordes, it still remains that it's utterly bloodless.

She does a respectable job playing two parts here, the camera work and editing in that regard is exceptionally good - I didn't notice any major issues with the special effects or body double(s).

Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara portray the parents of Mills' Sharon/Susan, both adding positive elements with their performances. I like the dynamic between the two, even if their characters aren't perfect; especially with the sprinkling of domestic violence from O'Hara's Maggie.

The plot, which I had heard about beforehand, is certainly interesting. They do a fine job at melding it together and making it feel more plausible than it is. With that said, I do believe the run time could've been shorter as the third act is a little uneven in my opinion.

19186,"Good watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend if you've seen any other Parent Trap and not this one.

This holds up surprisingly well: Hayley Mills did an excellent job playing both of the girls.  I questioned it once, but I honestly thought it was two different people during the movie.

That might explain why so much of the movie looked like green screen even though they established it was a real scene by interacting with it.  It is also surprising how much 1961 green screen looks like modern 2020 ""true motion"" with a almost fake looking background.

Yes, it is quite a gimmick to do a ""twins switch places"", though that's partly because of this movie.  It would be one thing if there were just a lot of twin actors looking to make it in the business, but today's climate would claim movies like this were stealing jobs from twins.

Though the movie is incredibly dated, it's actually interesting to see that 1950's motif where it was normal to have household staff still.  The adults were a bit of a bore, it was the girl(s) fighting or getting along to antagonize the adults that really makes the movie, and that might be the big problem of it all.  You have a young teen carrying the movie by doing double work, and the rest of the movie just doesn't feel loved.  Sadly it shows the ethics of 1960's Disney.

The movie is fun though, and while I doubt anyone is going to watch it over and over again, it is definitely worth a watch, if for nothing else than seeing a birth of a trope.",6.0

Captain Clegg (AKA: Night Creatures) is a Hammer-Major production in Eastman Color, it's directed by Peter Graham Scott with a screenplay written by John Elder. It stars Peter Cushing, Yvonne Romain, Patrick Allen, Oliver Reed, Michael Ripper and David Lodge. Music is by Don Banks and cinematography by Arthur Grant.

Hammer's film is actually a remake of a little known 1937 film called Doctor Syn that starred George Arliss as the title character and featured Margaret Lockwood in support. For their take on the Captain Clegg/Marsh Phantoms story, Hammer craft a colourful Gothic like mystery/thriller that contains horror elements. It's certainly not overtly horror, something that has undoubtedly threw some horror seekers venturing into the film for the first time. This may explain why to a large extent it remains a largely unknown Hammer picture, which doesn't as yet have a DVD release in the country of its birth! The story is a very good one with smugglers, murders, romantic passions, ghostly apparitions and duplicitous characters. All given an excellent period production design by Bernard Robinson for the interiors, while the exteriors are nicely filmed out of the village of Denham in South Buckinghamshire.

Pigeon Pie, Creepy Scarecrow and the Romney Marsh Phantoms.

Of course none of the period flavourings and narrative intrigue would mean much if the acting wasn't up to scratch. Which on reflection is another reason why this is something of a criminally under seen Hammer picture. For not only does it have Cushing turning in one of his best performances (blending dandy fop with a crafty undercurrent), it also has a cast around him that are fully committed and effective in their roles. Which nicely includes Hammer stalwart Michael Ripper (as Mipps the undertaker) getting a more meatier role than usual. Patrick Allen (Dial M for Murder) is imposing as the officious Captain Collier, Martin Benson (The King and I) is suitably shifty as Rash and David Lodge (The Cockleshell Heroes) adds the muscle presence as Bosun. Standing out is Olly Reed as Harry, wonderfully dominating his scenes, he does a neat line in brooding, while Romain (The Curse of the Werewolf) is the classic Hammer wench type, pretty with a heaving bosom, she induces lusty lustations in Harry and Rash.

There's some plot holes that the alert will not miss, and the big reveal is pretty much sign posted to us at the mid-point. But this is a little cracker that Hammer fans, Cushing fans and fans of period mysteries should definitely seek out. 8/10",8.0

A group of naval militants are sent by the Royal Crown to investigate rumors of smuggling at a coastal town in 1792, where whisperings of spooky “marsh phantoms” abound. Patrick Allen plays the humorless commanding officer of the King’s men while Peter Cushing stars as the genial pastor of the village.  

“Night Creatures” (1962) is an obscure Hammer production originally called “Captain Clegg” based on the first book in Russell Thorndike's Doctor Syn series – “A Tale of Romney Marsh,"" which was published in 1915. The title “Night Creatures” is a misnomer while “Captain Clegg” doesn’t work for reason I can’t explain. The working title “The Curse of Captain Clegg” would’ve been more fitting.

In any case, this is an 18th century costume melodrama with skullduggery and quite a bit of action, plus some spooky bits. The presence of Oliver Reed and Yvonne Romain naturally bring to mind “The Curse of the Werewolf” (1961) and this is cut from the same cloth, just minus the lycanthrope trappings. “Witchfinder General” (1968), aka “The Conqueror Worm,” is very comparable. “Black Death” (2010) was no doubt inspired by it, especially the mysterious marsh sequences.

Reed was in his prime and the stunning Yvonne Romain has a more significant role than “Curse of the Werewolf.” Meanwhile Cushing was at the top of his game as the interesting protagonist.

Released in 1989-1990, “Santa Sangre” (meaning “Holy Blood”) is a surreal circus fantasy made by cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky, who’s known for “El Topo” (1970) and “The Holy Mountain” (1973). His son, Axel, plays the protagonist here, Fenix.

Surreal or not, I love circus/carnival-oriented flicks and this one works well in its bizarre way for the first half, but totally bogs down in the second. The colors are vibrant and there’s a lot of deep symbolism with a Christ figure, a giant snake and so on. The various women are displayed in a creative titillating manner (Thelma Tixou as the tattooed woman, Blanca Guerra as the lithe high wire artist, Sabrina Dennison as the innocent Alma and Gloriella as Rubi) and I suspect this is a key reason why a lot of guys hail the film.

Unfortunately, the second half is dreadfully dull. Fenix doesn’t develop as a character in any attention-grabbing way and the story isn’t compelling, unless you find Fenix using his arms to help Mommy interesting. It’s still worth catching if you appreciate eccentric cult flicks that dare to be different, just be prepared for a tedious time in the second hour.

19249,"Pratfalls and smut a go go.

Come the 1970s we British really began to love our smut, it was a constitutional right to enjoy bawdy humour. Of course the quality was rarely above average, where the ""Carry On"" franchise would plunge the bawdy depths to try and get its laughs, and the ""Confessions Of"" series was never really any good to begin with anyway, but as long as they had people like Robin Askwith larking about amongst boobs, buttocks and innuendo unbound, then it was often enough for Brit cinema goers of a certain age.

On the Buses was a hugely popular TV series in the UK that ran for 7 series from 1969 to 1973. As was the case with many British situation comedies in the 70s, big screen outings would follow for the On the Buses crowd, three of them in fact, of which Holiday on the Buses was the last, and for many it was mercifully the death knell for such ventures.

It's a tired looking film when viewed now, the makers straining every sinew to keep the bawdy formula working, with much loved characters thrust into ever stupid situations to try and get laughs. Yet for fans of the series there is still some rewards to be found, but for interested outsiders looking in it's unlikely to generate more than a smile on the comedy scale.

It's hard to believe now that the likes of Stan Harper (Reg Varney) and Jack Harper (Bob Grant) could ever be seen as good looking enough to womanise and get sex on tap! But that's exactly what 1970s audiences were asked to buy into.

Just because there's snow on the roof doesn't mean the fire has gone out down below.

So here Stan the bus driver and Jack the conductor are now working at a Pontins Holiday Camp (how 70s British is that?!) and they basically try and get laid at every opportunity. As does Stan's sexually frustrated sister, Olive (played by the wonderful Anna Karen), only she just wants a bit from her husband Arthur! (Michael Robbins). Even widowed Ma Butler (Doris Hare) is up for a bit of the other, courtesy of the king of dirty old men, Wilfrid Brambell.

Naturally nemesis Inspector Cyril 'Blakey' Blake (Stephen Lewis) is on hand to provide the roguish lads with some japery opportunities, with the Hitler lookalike even getting a love interest himself here in the form of the holiday camp Nurse played by Kate Williams.

There's some good moments such as a swimming pool sequence of events, or Arthur Mullard attempting to dance (you have to know the actor to understand how funny that can be), while even Brambell doing his normal pervy routine is fun enough at times, but ultimately it rounds out as a picture for fans only, and even then it asks much of us to forgive it its lazy sins. 5/10",5.0

I am someone who enjoys the actual on the bus shenanigans most, which is somewhat lacking here - and even when they are on a bus, it's a tour one. The sexism remains, to the shock of nobody.

Reg Varney, Bob Grant and Stephen Lewis remain enjoyable, especially Lewis. As with the its predecessors, none of the support cast stand out majorly. There are a few amusing moments, but more limp ones to be honest. Most of the jokes felt repeated from the 1971 and 1972 productions.

19252,"Package Holiday Piffery.

The 24th film in the Carry On series finds the cast partaking in a package holiday to Els Bels. Once arriving they find their hotel still under construction and nobody much likes the company they are in!

This is actually one film that boasted the most regular Carry On cast members, something which carries the pic up above and through some choppy waters. Leaning heavily towards the more bawdy side of the franchise, it obviously couldn't appeal to everyone. This is the  1970s in Britain and it was becoming a place of decadent sexuality, which sees the makers earnest in their attempts to capture the zeitgeist of the time. Also one tends to think they had to be aware of the more openly sexual nature of some other comedy films of the era, thus they had to compete.

This is great fun for series fans, an absolute ramshackle holiday experience, the very definition of a cheap deal that ""WAS"" too good to be true. The makers bombard us purposely with stereotypes - the Brits abroad crassness, the bad food and excessive drinking, the undersexed and the oversexed clientèle, bad weather, nudity, a raucous set to at a red light establishment, sexual stimulants and on it goes - no sand pebble is left unturned.

Cast are great, reliable sorts with such cheeky material to work from. Peter Buterworth takes the leading honours as the hotel manager trying to convince everyone this hotel from hell is a paradise! and he is well supported by June Whitfield who makes of her more expansive ventures into the series. The double entendre's flow, the chaotic scenes stack up and the corn is well and truly laid on a plate. Suffice to say this is not about pathos or intelligent meanings!

The finale is two-fold and great for fans, the drunken party on the last night at the hotel literally is crash bang and wallop, while the collective character closure at Sid and Joan's English bar has a warmness to it that fans can relate to. Charles Hawtrey, the legendary skeleton on legs, left the series here, playing an alcoholic rogue, the makers accepting his real life issues and incorporating it into his farewell performance for some poignant reflection. 7/10",7.0

Of course the hotel isn't finished, and that's not the only thing that isn't. Though at times it is quite amusing, for the most part the script just plays to the talent and they are not really on best form. We are frequently left with some overly contrived stereotypes and a humour that is just a bit too coarse. Not that there isn't smut a-plenty in the others of this franchise, but that is usually a little more subtle. To be fair, it doesn't hang about - the gags come thick and fast, and are delivered by a well-oiled machine that knows exactly what it is doing. Sadly, though, it has aged badly and though I reckon the female characters fare slightly better than the men on the humour front, nobody here can say this is their finest work - not even the donkey.",6.0

Needless to say, this is a roaring success and ""Charlie"" suddenly finds his fares drying up and he must find a solution... Although a few of the regulars still feature here, this is essentially an enjoyable duel between the two and it's fun. I always had a soft spot for the Una O'Connor/Mildred Natwick style of characters and Cannon fills that role nicely here as the story ebbs and flows before it culminates in a co-ordinated taxi chase and a niftyile exercised motorised pincer movement.

Description:
A man must survive a prison where hardened criminals battle to the death for the wardens' entertainment.

Review:
In Hell is a 2003 Action Drama starring Jean-Claude Van Damme that's surprisingly watchable. Van Damme plays Kyle Leblanc a man sent to a Russian prison after the killing his wife's murderer. Leblanc is sentenced to life in this run down prison where the warden arranges illegal fights.

Van Damme takes a departure from his usual tough guy who kicks ass in prison like Death Warrant and instead is a troubled mourning prisoner who sees his wife's image as he descends into madness while in solitary confinement. Of course the story becomes predictable as Van Damme becomes the top fighter and the surrounding actors are forgettable including former football star Lawrence Taylor. Similar to the Undisputed series and as serious as Lock-Up, In Hell is a great turn for Van Damme which sets you up for his performance just a few years later in JCVD.

RELEASED TO VIDEO in 1995, ""Leprechaun 3"" is the second sequel in the series about a hideous little leprechaun (Warwick Davis) who likes to kill those who take from his pot of gold. This one's set in Las Vegas and features a young dude who gets infected with the Leprechaun's green blood and starts to morph into a (taller) leprechaun himself (John Gatins).

Although ""Leprechaun 3"" plays it pretty straight there's also quite a bit of camp. Regardless, it's nigh impossible to take seriously due to the cartoonish leprechaun; consequently, the film is more comedy than horror. In fact, it's not horrifying at all. But it _IS_ entertaining, and that's the name of the game.

As my title blurb would suggest, ""Leprechaun 3"" is well worth watching for the character of Tammy alone, played by Lee Armstrong. It's great to have an intelligent, winsome female protagonist with actual and natural curves, rather than the usual too-thin blondes with chicken legs and fake breasts. Lee blows them all out of the water and her outfits only accentuate her appeal. Too bad she left acting behind the same year ""Leprechaun 3"" was released, but at least we have this film to remember her awe-inspiring beauty.

Released to video in 1997, ""Leprechaun 4: In Space"" takes place in the future where a group of space marines travel to a distant planet to stop a power-hungry Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) from harming a Dominian princess, Zarina (Rebecca Carlton). The Marines' civilian boss is a mad scientist by the name of Dr. Mittenhand (Guy Siner). When the Leprechaun eventually manifests on the vessel havoc ensues.

I've only seen the first four Leprechaun movies and this is my second favorite after ""Leprechaun 3"" (1995). As a low-budget horror/comedy, you have to take it for what it is to appreciate it. Davis is entertaining as usual as the eponymous imp and the quality cast take it all tongue-in-cheek.

The Leprechaun rebirth scene is particularly effective, both funny and perverse. The way Dr. Mittenhand de-morphs is also done well. Meanwhile Rebecca Carlton & Jessica Collins are definite highlights as Princess Zarina and Tina, but they coulda done more with Zarina.

""Jaxon X"" (2002) is cut from the same cloth, but had a bigger budget and is all-around superior.

The movie runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot at Front Street Studios, Los Angeles. ADDITIONAL CAST: Brent Jasmer and Tim Colceri play the main Marines while Debbe Dunning plays a secondary one. Gary Grossman is also on hand.

It certainly makes the most sense out of any of the movies. Now does it have any sort of applicable continuity to the movie that is its predecessor? Or indeed any of the _Leprechaun_ movies? Just like every other one of these sequels, the answer to that question is a firm no. There is absolutely no way that even just any **two** of the _Leprechaun_ movies could make for some sort of actual series of related events. But! Contained completely within itself, _Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood_ actually does have a comprehensible throughline of plot, setting, lore, and characters, which is amazing.

Determined to capitalise on this, he returns to Britain and with Hattie Jacques again donning her matron's uniform is soon making a mint. His good fortune attracts the attention of his erstwhile boss ""Dr. Carver"" (Kenneth Williams) and soon he has to fend of those not just envious of his success, but also those who want to see him six feet under (theatrically speaking!). I think the clue here is in the title: ""Again"". This is really just a rehash of old jokes and old scenarios just topped and tailed with a different front page. The jokes have been versioned several times before and to be honest, I felt the cast looked a little battle-weary. Barbara Windsor is growing in confidence and owning the screen more now, Joan Sims still has some of the best one-liners (along with James) and the film certainly doesn't hang about - but there are only just so many times Williams can flare his nostrils before you actually want some smoke to come out.",6.0

I like this entry in the series, I really do. Many others however find it a dud and feel that it should be flushed down one of the toilets that feature at W.C. Boggs' factory in the film. Blending the obvious toilet gags with a tale about unionised shop floors, the Carry On team have actually crafted one of the franchise's less mucky pictures. Sid James, so long the bastion of sexually driven lechery in Carry On folklore, has a very restrained role in this one, and this to me somewhat explains to an extent why ""Convenience"" is often shunned by the series fans.

Elsewhere it's the subplots away from the factory that put the smile on my face. Charles Hawtrey is indulging in strip poker with shop steward, Vic Spanner's mother!. While James' Sid Plummer is getting horse racing winners from his budgie!, all under the watchful eye of his apparently scatty wife Beattie (a terrific Hattie Jacques). Sexy eye candy for us blokes comes in the form of Jacki Piper, and the film finale on the Brighton seaside is drunken buffoonery to at least raise a giggle or two.

Fortunately, they have the design expertise of ""Coote"" (Charles Hawtrey) but their pesky shop steward ""Spanner"" (Kenneth Cope) spots flaws in the allocation of the labour and a strike is called. No bidets, no business - or can a way be found to turn the taps back on at the works? Yes, there is loads of toilet humour that is just a bit predictably silly but the characters are quite well constructed with plenty of room for some politically incorrect behaviour, some smut and a wee bit of how's your father. It's quite interesting also in that it takes more of a swipe at the working class and at some of the ridiculousness of trade unionism and the culture of cutting off your nose to spite your face.

It's a retread of Carry On Camping only with caravans as the usual array of characters are ripe for fun picking innuendo laden shenanigans. Plot for what it's worth has a bunch of Carry On holidaymakers caravanning next to a Roman excavation site being run by Prof Anna Vrooshka (Elke Sommer) and Prof. Roland Crump (Kenneth Williams). Chaos inevitable ensues.

The absence of Sid James, Charles Hawtrey, Hattie Jacques and Terry Scott was always going to be felt (they had all left the franchise by this time), but Williams, Bernard Bresslaw , Kenneth Connor, Joan Simms and Peter Butterworth plough on stoically with the thin formulaic screenplay. Windsor Davis supplements them but he's no Sid James.

The series would trundle out two more films in the 70s before the ill advised comeback movie in 1992 (Carry on Columbus), one of which was the dreadful Carry on England. ""Behind"" isn't an awful movie as it does have its moments, such as the by-play between Sommer and Williams, and Bresslaw's henpecked husband act. It's also a very good snapshot of the era with budget holidays pointing to the unsteady political climate, while the sexual aspects reek of a time well left behind - but those attitudes did exist back then.

It's a bit of a rip-off of ""Carry on Camping"" (1969) and is, frankly, a really poor relation. Windsor Davies (""Fred"") largely takes centre stage, and he overcooks the role with his increasingly annoying cheeky guffawing and slightly smutty mannerisms. Connor is also well past his best now with even the usually reliable Joan Sims looking out of sorts with her rather diminished role. Indeed, now the entire franchise has really become a rather crass and unfunny excuse for scantily clad gals and some lecherous old men. This just isn't funny. It's contrived, charm-free and for those of us in the UK, we can start to see a new generation of comedy actors (including Ian Lavender and Donald Hewlett) starting to come through in the stead of those who, even at their worst, were still much better than the assembled mediocrity we have here.

It has a mixed reputation among the fans, but Terror of Mechagodzilla is a romp of a sequel, one that's not without deep emotional heart.

Plot is bonkers of course, aliens are plotting to rule the world and have recreated Mechagodzilla after Godzilla shredded it to pieces in the previous meeting of the two beasts (Godzilla V Mechagodzilla). There's Interpol agents running around not exactly in control of anything, a vengeful scientist with an agenda who aids the aliens, while his daughter has become a cyborg designed to control Titanosaurus, a gigantic amphibious dinosaur that teams up with Mechagodzilla to stomp on Tokyo. All is lost for mankind, until Godzilla climbs out of the ocean to hopefully protect his domain.

The return of Ishirō Honda to the director's chair is a reassuring presence, and it helps the film retain a classy production level. The monster smack-downs are neatly choreographed, the model work is wonderfully 1970s, and Akira Ifukube's thunderous score gladdens the spirit as it simultaneously rocks your bones. Yukiko Takayama's screenplay contains intelligence, where the sci-fi boffin speak is spliced with deep observations on humanity and what it means to be part of such a race etc.

Fan division usually comes down to who likes super-hero Godzilla or who likes Godzilla in destroy everything mode. This is the former, and it's cheer worthy, the atomic lizard in a bad mood would not surface again for 10 years, and by then the direction of Zilla's fortunes got increasingly silly. This marks ""Terror"" as something of a franchise closure to be cherished, and rightly so because it has all the good parts that made the first Toho wave so enjoyable.

Johnny is feeling the heat, from every corner of his world it seems.

At the time of writing this, Johnny O' Clock has under ten reviews written on IMDb and barely 200 votes cast, one can only assume that Johnny is badly under seen! Without knowing the issues of accessibility on TV and DVD, it may just be that this little noir treasure has slipped through the net of many a genre observer. Without pushing the boundaries of noir and its devilish off shoots, it's a film with all the necessary noir components in place, a tightly accomplished film that definitely deserves a bigger audience.

The plot, though very basic in the context of the genre/style it sits in (thus making it easy enough for the casual viewer to enjoy), is a series of double (triple) crosses smothered in a delicate hint of aromatic femme fatale. Throw in crooked and grizzly bear like coppers, get Robert Rossen to make it his directorial debut, and ask Burnett Guffey to photograph it, and you got a lovely helping of noirish stew. All you then ask for is your cast to come up trumps, and thankfully they do.

Dick Powell plays Johnny O'Clock with the right blend of dapper charm and cool calm toughness, Lee J Cobb (grizzly bear copper), Thomas Gomez (Pete Marchettis) and John Kellogg (the muscle) all play it tough without over egging the pudding. The girls are nicely played by Evelyn Keyes (""99 River Street"" & ""The Seven Year Itch""), Ellen Drew (""The Man from Colorado"") and the delicious Nina Foch (""The Ten Commandments"") - with Drew showing definite shades of Hayworth at times - though only shades mind!

For this, the 12th Godzilla film, a monster theme park worker learns that his new employers are actually aliens who plan to use Ghidorah and Gigan to destroy earth. Time for Godzilla and Anguirus to step forward to defend mankind!

By the time the 1970s had arrived, Toho had decreed that Godzilla should be more family friendly. Gone was the once mighty atomic beast that stomped down on the human race, in his place was the mighty saviour of mankind. Godzilla would be pitched against - or turn up along side - various other beasties, the smack downs being the highlight of pretty lightweight plotting.

Here we have a fun tag-team like scenario where Zilla teams up with Anguirus to stop the three headed might of Ghidorah and the new monster on the block, Gigan. Gigan is sure funny looking but with hooks for appendages and a buzzsaw blade in its belly, it's a quality foe and is sure to dish out some bloody damage.

Plot is hopelessly weak, a rehash job yet again, and the use of stock footage becomes annoying. And yes! this is the series entry where Zilla and Anguirus have a brief conversation, which is quite surreal and something no series fan should have to endure.

Thankfully the action is great fun, including a wonderful moment when Zilla bobs and weaves as a pugilist whilst fighting Ghidora.

Two women. Catherine marries men for their money, then murders them. The other, Alexandra Barnes is on her tail, getting in close to hopefully expose her crimes...

Rafelson's neo-noir homages the film noir femme fatales of the 40s and 50s with a high degree of success. There's much potency in the screenplay that puts it firmly in the noir universe. Flip flopping the misogyny angles of yesteryear, pic pitches the ultimate femme fatale destroyer of men into a cat and mouse scenario with a sexually repressed opponent - or is she a jealous but secret admirer? The transformation of Winger's dowdy Justice Department Agent into a blossoming lady at Catherine Black Widow's (Russell super sexy and sensuous) side brings in the doppelgänger effect, a good old noir staple. The sexual tension is a constant, particularly when Paul Nuytten (Sami Frey) is brought into proceedings, something which shifts the piece still further into noirville.

There's also other characters straight out of film noir. Be it Alexandra's boss (the always reliable Terry O'Quinn), who's a lech harbouring desires for Alex, or sleazy Private Investigator H Shin (James Hong) who has a needle habit, it's clear that Rafelson and Bass know their noir. Unfortunately most of the play is in daylight, meaning missed opportunities for some psychological shadow play is passed up. Though it should be noted that Hall's photography is slick and tonally in tune, especially when lighting scenes involving Russell as prime focus. It all builds to a splendid finale, the makers pulling us both ways as to where it will lead. Sure, some of the plot devices are weak, but in the main this is sexy, intriguing and tricksy in narrative, whilst tech credits stay at the higher end of the scale. 7/10",7.0

Yet the movie shoots for something deeper as this is an amusing and potent satire on the influence and manipulation of the entertainment industry.

19375,"Tanner Cohen reminded me of Adam Lambert (whom I'd love to see actually play ""Puck"") in this over-the-top but enjoyable musical spin on Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"".

Soon, just about the entire town are captured in his web of mischief. Anyone who has read the play will appreciate that ""Puck"" is one of the best comic characters in English literature, and Cohen does a better than decent job at marrying the frustrations and naughtiness of the fairy into a 21st century environment. Wendy Robie is also good as the drama teacher with a little extra bit of magic to her. It suffers a little from being a smidge too theatrical without the lighting budget to support it; and the singing isn't magnificent - but all in all, a courageous effort from Tom Gustafson to tackle quite a tough project.

<em>'The Cat from Outer Space'</em> is mundane. The concept of an alien cat invading is cool, but they choose to do it in a way that is boring - the cat, Jake, speaks via voiceover only, so there are many shots of the cat just staring whilst Ronnie Schell speaks. That just doesn't work, to get attached/become interested in a character you need emotion and/or expression... you get none of that here. I never cared for Jake, and that's coming from someone who loves cats.

Also with the plot they spend most of the time focusing on the cat helping the humans with dull things, like betting and freezing people. Quite inconsistently too, there's a number of times where the cat could solve their problem instantly but they avoid using him for some reason. It's only at the end when they, truly, tackle the overall story arc - which itself is held back by the (understandably, I guess) lame special effects.

Biloxi Blues is directed by Mike Nichols and written by Neil Simon. It is based on Simon's semi-autobiographical 1985 play of the same name. It stars Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken, Penelope Ann Miller, Corey Parker and Matt Mulhern. Music is by Georges Delerue and Bill Butler is the cinematographer.

The second part of Neil Simon's Eugene Morris Jerome trilogy, the plot centers around Eugene's (Broderick) draft into the United States Army during the last year of World War II. Sent to training camp at Biloxi, Mississippi, Eugene is thrust in amongst people from all walks of life. Here he will not only learn about life, but also have it changed for him.

Straight from the off I have to say that this has become one of my favourite films of all time. From the moment I first caught it back on release, where I only went to see it because it was written by the guy who wrote The Odd Couple, I have without fail been humoured and charmed every year since. On synopsis it seems to be yet another run of the mill coming of age picture, or just another tales from the boot camp time filler, but with Simon holding the pen and Nichols painting the narrative with careful nostalgic splendour, Biloxi Blues is much better than it's often given credit for. For it's a film that is that rare old beast that strikes the right balance between laughter and sentiment. 

""It was hard to believe these guys had mothers and fathers who were worried about them"" 

Although this is primarily Eugene's story, film is propelled by the bubbling concoction of a group dynamic. At training camp Eugene and the other lads have to face up to a number of challenges, not just growing up into men, but learning about bigots, bullies, homosexuals and intellectuals, all while under the borderline crazy command of Sergeant Merwin J. Toomey (Walken). They may all be different personalities and from different backgrounds, but one thing binds them together, that none of them want to be there! In other hands this group would have consisted of annoying stereotypes, but Simon and Nichols, courtesy of the writing and the garnering of acting performances, ensure this isn't the case. The audience isn't short changed with these characterisations because they are stripped down to being survivors by way of humour and naive honour. Thus it never feels false. 

""I wasn't in on that Pearl Harbour thing"" 

One of America's most celebrated film critics said Biloxi Blues contains limp dialogue! That's something which I certainly can't begin to comprehend. For the film is an advertisement for witty retorts, where often responses are used as a survivalist tool, to de-heat a flare up or to hide nervousness. In this respect Biloxi Blues pays big on revisits, each time another little one-line gem registers where previously it had been missed, maybe because we are too focused on the airy sound track first time around? Or most likely because we are too lost in a ""Eugene"" or ""Toomey"" facial moment. One of the best passages in the story concerns a last week on Earth game the lads play, the writing is sharp, yet tender, funny, yet telling. It really is a case of laugh whilst being drawn into the frightening reality that these boys are a long way from home, with the very real possibly they soon could be fighting for their lives in some muddy trench. 

The cast are uniformly strong. Walken delivers one of his quintessential mania turns, marking Toomey out as being one click away from either sane or insane. Broderick holds court and narrates with earnest style, while Corey Parker is a revelation as intellectual Arnold Epstein, a guy who no matter how much he is persecuted by Toomey and the other rookies, refuses to be shaken and lose his principles. Miller and Park Overall get the two female roles of note, both memorable in short appearances, with the latter deliciously dry as a hooker with a heart. In the support there's macho mirth from Mulhern (stomach of a goat) and Markus Flanagan (he calls his mother Louise), homespun mystery from an excellent Michael Dolan, and wistful tunings from Casey Siemaszko as Don Carney (can anyone count on him?). 

The ending doesn't quite have the dramatic impact that many would expect, and there is indeed some mellow periods of tinted nostalgia that will have some viewers urging the pace to go faster, but these are mere fly specks on a mound of horse droppings. Biloxi Blues, a wonderfully rich comedy drama, and to my mind the best thing Simon has written. 10/10",10.0
19383,"Roger Corman offered to produce (without credit) whatever film first time director Peter Bogdanovich wanted to make under two conditions: He had to cast Boris Karloff, who owed Corman two days work; and to keep the cost down, he had to pad the running time with footage from an earlier Karloff film. The result was TARGETS (1968), which proved to be too topical for many theaters to touch when it initially appeared. That's a shame, because it provided Karloff with an A-level role as the sun set on his life and career. Bogdanovich tells parallel stories which converge at the finale: One involves a young man who turns to bloodshed when he feels that he has nothing ahead of him; the other revolves around an aged film star who believes that everything is behind him. Timely when released because of the social climate; timely now because of the politically charged debate over gun control; and ultimately - thanks to the presence of the great Karloff - timeless.",7.0
19383,"**_As relevant today as it was when it was made_**

An aged horror icon (Boris Karloff) wants to retire because he’s weary of the biz and thinks modern life has become more horrifying than his old-fashioned movies. But a director/writer (Peter Bogdanovich) encourages him to read an atypical script or, at least, attend a promotional appearance at a drive-in, which is showing his latest movie, “The Terror.” Unfortunately, a young ordinary man (Tim O'Kelly) has snapped and is on a killing spree with the drive-in being his final shooting range.

“Targets” (1968) is a minor cult masterpiece, a self-conscious postmodernist piece inspired by the “Texas Tower Sniper” from August 1, 1966, who killed 14 people and wounded 31 others at the University of Texas at Austin. Bobby (O'Kelly) is patterned after the lunatic murderer with the setting simply switched to the San Fernando Valley in SoCal. 

I took the flick as a bleak commentary on the way it simply is in America rather than a criticism of the 2nd Amendment. After all, outlawing alcohol during Prohibition didn’t stop people from selling & purchasing booze and neither have drug laws in the modern day stopped people from selling & buying illegal drugs. Evil doesn’t exist in a gun, knife, club or rock, but in the hearts of people bent on taking innocent lives for their own evil purposes.

Plus, as clichéd as it may sound, the quickest way to stop an evil person with a gun is by a good person with a gun (certainly not an elderly man with a cane). A good recent example is the case in Charleston, West Virginia, on May 25, 2022, where a brave woman shot an active shooter dead before he was able to murder anyone gathered at an apartment complex. Dissolving the 2nd Amendment would only prevent law-abiding citizens from buying/owning firearms; it wouldn’t prevent wackos intent on bloodshed from purchasing firearms on the black market.  

To support this, Bobby panics at the climax precisely because some male viewers at the drive-in have grabbed their legal guns to take care of the sniper. Keep in mind that producer Roger Corman sold the movie to Paramount rather than release it through AIP. After the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy the studio released only six prints and prefaced the flick with a statement advocating gun control. Director Bogdanovich had zero to do with this.

“Targets” works as an interesting psychological study: What is it that causes Bobby to ‘snap’ and ruin his life by going on a crazed killing spree? His respectable-yet-intimidating father has properly trained him on firearm safety, but he has also inadvertently made his son a frustrated weakling — a bomb just waiting to go off. The disease of legalism is all over his parent’s household, where the young couple resides. Look at the clues.

This was one of Karloff’s last movies. He passed away 5.5 months after its release at the age of 81. Thankfully, he plays an interesting protagonist, a hero even, rather than some cheesy boogeyman for the millionth time. Plus I enjoyed the levity provided by his character and Bogdanovich’s, which counterbalances the stark, depressing vacancy of the rest of the story. 

Really, the flick is about the thin line between reality and art, the relationship between real-life and films. For instance, the killer loading his rifle is paralleled with the projectionist loading his projector at the drive-in. Also, the slayer confuses the old man intently moving toward him with the actor’s character on the big screen. It’s equally about the decline of morals and banalization of life in the modern day, particularly America and Western Culture, where we’ve lost our spiritual compass and sense of purpose.

Lastly, the easy access to firearms can culminate in deadly expression of pent-up frustration and anger, which is just below the surface in some otherwise perfectly normal people. Again, the most effective way to stop ’em with the least amount of bloodshed is a good person with a gun, who’s on the scene. ’Nuff said.      

The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles, including Van Nuys, Hollywood, West Hollywood and Reseda.

Highly paid, he meticulously plans his projects so as to leave no trace of anything to suggest the deaths are not natural or accidents. When he is ordered to carry out a job on his handler ""Harry"" (Keenan Wynn), he doesn't flinch but he does take the man's son ""Steve"" (Jan-Michael Vincent) under his wing afterwards. It's clear that the younger man wants to emulate ""Bishop"" and so he takes him in training and onto a couple of jobs. These jobs don't go as smoothly as he'd expected, though, and pretty swiftly ""Bishop"" begins to wonder if he's being set up. If his employers can turn on ""Harry"" then could they turn on him, too - no more loose ends? Bronson is on his best form here as the grumpy but highly effective killer and as the plot develops, his less-is-more style of delivery, aided by a sensible paucity of dialogue, helps to build quite a sense of peril. Vincent isn't quite in that class, but he's adequate enough as the enthusiastic apostle in a story that maybe isn't the hardest to solve, but one that does play out well with a fine twist at the end.

She is a lady of the night whom we see, right at the start, being shoved into the river by her robber boyfriend and left to drown. Rescued thanks to an alert local urchin and a few locals. she is shaken but largely undeterred! From now on, we follow her on her continuing escapades as she defiantly refuses to give up on love. She thinks she has lucked out with a champagne and caviar film actor, but is soon further disillusioned and it is only a chance encounter with the rather unassuming ""D'Onofrio"" (François Périer) who had admired her on stage one evening, that things might - just might - offer our wandering spirit that which her heart desires most. Fellini uses the still largely war-torn streets of Rome as an effective backdrop to this most human of stories, and the writing allows Miss Masina to deliver her quick-fire, frequently comical (and always unerringly optimistic) dialogue expertly. She is very much in her element as the story develops. There is an air of cynicism to the whole thing, but somehow her character manages to punch through it - and that's what made this entertaining for me. It could have been just a procedural and predictable drama, but it isn't. There are no certainties with the plot. Indeed, the only certainty is that she is never going to give up! The supporting cast deliver really effectively - either as characters with a direct bearing on her life (""Wanda"" (Franca Marzi) for example) or as a means for the audience to recalibrate and come up for air for a moment or two.

In 1948, a wealthy landowner in Meriwether County (Griffith) controls the Sheriff and the citizens, but when he flaunts his power in neighboring Coweta County, the no-nonsense Sheriff comes after him (Cash). 

“Murder in Coweta County” (1983) is a well-done period piece based on the true story, also called “Last Blood.” It’s similar to “Mississippi Burning,” which came out five years later (and no doubt influenced it), just with the television budget of “Murder in Mississippi” (1990), which is the unofficial prequel to that more famous theatrical film.

Johnny’s wife, June Carter Cash, has an interesting role as a backwoods Christian seer. John Wallace (Griffith) visiting her in desperation is reminiscent of King Saul going to the witch of Endor in the Bible (1 Samuel 28).

Griffith is effective in the rare role of the antagonist, which he proved he could do 9 years earlier in another worthwhile TV production, “Pray for the Wildcats.”

Sir Simon of Canterville gets roped into fighting a duel for his cousin, realising he faces certain death he flees the field awash with cowardice.

He is doomed to haunt the Canterville castle until a fellow member of the family can commit an act of bravery and thus lift the cowardly stain that has besmirched the Canterville name.

Doesn't sound much like a comedy does it? But it is, and a very amiable one at that. Loosely based on Oscar Wilde's story of the same name, The Canterville Ghost benefits from a couple of charming performances from Charles Laughton as Simon, and from a young Margaret O'Brien as Lady Jessica de Canterville. Laughton is clearly enjoying himself as the ghost, heavy on the ""woe is me"" theatrics coupled with gusto comedy, it's a very enjoyable performance from the big man. O'Brien is here enjoying being the center of attention and she positively lights up every scene she is in with youthful exuberance. The story follows a well trodden path to its rewarding ending, but it's a fun ride getting there regardless. Things really pick up a pace once a platoon of American soldiers are billeted at the castle and we are introduced to Cuffy Williams (Robert Young), a descendant Canterville of course, but he himself is showing a line in cowardice, so we are then left wondering if Cuffy can indeed show bravery and thus free Simon from his ghostly duties? 7/10",7.0

It Came From Outer Space stands as one of the better sci-fi pictures to come out of the Cold War 1950s. Based on the Ray Bradbury story ""The Meteor"", the story leans heavily on anti-conformist themes and confidently trumpets something different to ourselves actually having the damn right to be different, and that is something I can personally truck with. As with most of the other films from the sci-fi/alien genre, ""it"" perfectly captures the paranoia of the people, the sense of mistrust befitting the atomic age, the fear of the desert never more evident than it is here.

Directed with some style from genre guru ""Jack Arnold"" (""This Island Earth""/""The Incredible Shrinking Man""), the film was originally shot in 3D, and though sadly I have never been able to see the picture in that format, I can certainly imagine greatly the impact that certain scenes would have had. The picture is also notable for the use of POV shooting from the alien perspective, all fuzzy focus from a spherical single eye, it works real well and would be something that many other film makers would use from here on in. 

This is not a film that relies on creatures to see it home safely, in fact we barely glimpse the creatures here, but we don't need that to be the case, for they make their mark regardless, all of which leaves It Came From Outer Space as a very knowing and quite often intelligent piece of work. 8/10",8.0

1863 and it's the back end of the American Civil War, a group of Confederate deserters rob their own army's gold being delivered to the bank of Fairhope. Leaving a bloody trail in their wake, the group set off for Mexico but must stop for rest and recuperation at a deserted farm mansion over looking a long dead plantation. With a storm moving in and tempers among the thieves running high, it soon becomes evident that something otherworldly resides at the house and the surrounding area…

Dead Birds is a little cracker, a straight to video horror film that to my mind puts to shame some of the big budgeted piles of crap that get released to the multiplexes on a seemingly weekly basis. Of course, horror is very subjective, where along with comedy it forms a pair of genres guaranteed to produce films that will never ever please everyone. Falling into the haunted house sub-genre of horror, Dead Birds, in spite of its unique Civil War period setting, has been lambasted by many a horror fan for not being fresh, that it's a collage of other horror movies. There's some truth to that, but we could level that charge at 98% of horror movies anyway! But Dead Birds (crap title btw) does have a cult fan base, a fan base I'm very much proud to be part of.

Alex Turner, for his first feature length debut, has crafted a haunted house picture that positively pulses with dread, with its slow deliberate pacing and hushed conversational tones, the atmosphere crackles with unease. The opening credits are jet black and rise from the earth like spectral portents of death. Then after the fireworks of the robbery, things settle into a sort of ethereal rhythm. The gang make their way to their doom through a murky landscape until they reach what they don't know is their final destination; the plantation, a place that just reeks of death and disharmony.

The cornfield is long dead and home to a strange creature, the battered old scarecrow looks ripe for a fright and a dead bird on the floor is ominous. The house itself is a two story wooden type not used often in tales of this type. It looks moody, as does the servants quarters, there's also a creepy barn with its hayloft and a water well of course. These are genre staples for sure, but Turner gathers all the clichés and gives them a new lease of life in a new period setting. The secret is in the lighting, Turner and Yedlin (Brick/Looper) light from down low, giving off a wonderful eerie effect as the gang trudge around this place of misery. It may sound like an oxy-moronic statement, but this is one beautifully shot horror film.

Then there's the shocks, the boo-jump moments (sadly revealed in the trailer for those unfortunate to not see the film first), these are not frequent so as to make the film reliant on them, they are used sparingly and only to advance the plot as the plantation's history literally comes to life. The cast are on fine form (Thomas and Washington standing out), working well with a dynamic infused with greed, mistrust, jealousy and racism. Lopez's musical score blends foreboding rumbles with spine chilling shards of noise, while Turner slots in some oblique angles to further enhance the feeling of hopeless disorientation. It may cover familiar ground, that of a bunch of folk in a spooky house being bumped off one by one, with suspicions aroused, but Dead Birds is very much its own animal. Hee, literally. 8/10",8.0

I suppose for a first time director it wasn't absolutely awful.

19599,"Fresh from his success as tea-time totty ""Robin Hood"" for the BBC, Jonas Armstrong takes on something altogether more sinister here in this low brow adaptation of Clive Barker's ""Book of Blood"" stories. He is ""Simon"" who becomes the fascination of writer ""Mary"" (Sophie Ward) who works with her electronics expert buddy to track down the paranormal. Of course the vast majority of her cases end up fakes, but she senses something legit about her new pal and when they all find themselves in a really creepy Edinburgh house, she thinks that just perhaps they are slap bang in the middle of a super spooky highway where souls commute from here to there! Thing is, is he the real deal or is it all smoke and mirrors? He's not a shy man and is semi-naked for much of this film; Ward isn't far behind and those increasingly smouldering elements of sexual chemistry are heavily relied upon by director John Harrison to keep us awake. Otherwise, this is a singularly dull ghost story that really plods glacially along until the last fifteen minutes when we finally get some sort of action. To be fair to Armstrong, he has committed much to the part and for a lot of it his body looks like it's in considerable pain covered, as it is, in inscriptions that look like they've been carved straight onto his skin using a school compass. Some stories are just best read and left to our imagination, and these Barker stories are probably those. It'll probably do in a cinema at Halloween if you've had a few beers, but otherwise is all just a showcase for two handsome people who don't mind getting their kit off. Lord only knows how they managed to spend £5 millions on the production.",5.0
19610,"_**Well done 70’s rock lifestyle film, but needs better songs**_

A big time rock star is self-destructing on the lifestyle (Kris Kristofferson) when he inadvertently meets a talented smalltime singer (Barbra Streisand) and becomes her “golden connection” to stardom. Gary Busey is on hand as the former’s manager.     

""A Star is Born"" (1976) is a drama/romance/musical focusing on the 70’s rock star lifestyle, which differentiates it from the two classic versions from 1937 and 1954. It’s similar to the later “The Rose” (1979), but I prefer this one. “Oh, God! You Devil” (1984) is another good comparison, despite the paranormal elements, and I slightly prefer that one. 

Kris Kristofferson is effective as the stud rock star in the manner of, say, Lindsey Buckingham in the 70s. He’s not the best singer but, then again, Bob Dylan wasn’t either (of course, he’s still alive as of this writing). 

Meanwhile Barbra never looked better, especially in her white Superman outfit in the desert. She’s a great singer, but none of the songs in the movie stir me much. At least Cher had great songs in the 70s, not to mention Fleetwood Mac. That’s what this movie needs, better songs, especially since so much time is devoted to Barbra performing. At the same time, the songs are certainly serviceable.

The best part of the movie, for me, is the dynamic opening act. It then bogs down with the love story, but I appreciated the unexpected desert sequences. The ending is, um, I can’t give it away.

One night he stumbles across a small bar where a band ""the Oreos"" are playing. He effectively trashes their set much to the chagrin of Streisand. He does, however, rate her voice and after a wobbly start sets her on the road to stardom. What sets this apart from the earlier films is that there is much more music - and the soundtrack that produced ""Evergreen"" and ""Lost Inside of You""; whilst not quite ""The Man that Got Away"" provides an amiable substitute for some pretty run-of-the-mill dialogue.

19661,"Myriad Maze of Mental Mirages.

Mirage is directed by Edward Dmytryk and adapted by Peter Stone from a book written by Howard Fast. It stars Gregory Peck, Diane Baker, Walter Matthau, Kevin McCarthy, Leif Erickson and George Kennedy. Music is scored by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Joseph MacDonald.

David Stillwell (Peck) finds he is suffering from Unconscious Amnesia and that he has blacked out the events of the previous two years. That's rare, but Stillwell must find out what happened because he might have a lover, has shifty characters after him and he may even have committed murder?.

20 years after appearing in the tricksy and turny psychological thriller ""Spellbound"" for Alfred Hitchcock, Gregory Peck jumps into the same type of shoes with a modicum of success. It's a little too contrived for its own good, with the odd character serving to the plot as god knows what? Seriously, what is Baker doing here? While the weak ending doesn't pay off on the suspense and mystery that had previously been well orchestrated by Dmytryk. On the plus side is the shadowy black and white photography by MacDonald, giving the film an edge, and the use of real New York locations lend the film some serio worth.

Matthau slips in and steals the film from an efficient Peck, and Kennedy and McCarthy score well as muscle and shifty respectively. It's not essential as a Peck or Dmytryk piece, or as a politico/mystery thriller, but enough interest within to keep it above average and Matthau more than makes it worth while. 6/10",6.0

Well neither he, nor we, have a clue - but luckily he has enough of a survival instinct to make it past the first few attempts on his life and alight on savvy PI ""Caselle"" (Walter Matthau) with whom he tries to put together what seems the most unlikely of stories. Nothing makes sense to the man - he remembers nothing that makes sense. His old office has gone, his recollections likewise. People are speaking with him about whom he knows nothing. Has any of this anything to do with the recent death of charity boss ""Calvin""? He does know his job - but he has no idea what that job entails (maybe he is a politician!?). Gradually, and painstakingly, he must continue to evade those pursuing him whilst he tries to piece together the jigsaw of his life. Peck is on good form here, he delivers a convincing performance as a character devoid of any form of psychological security. He simply doesn't recall who he is. He knows not whom to trust nor why any of this is happening. His frustration is palpable and we are drawn into his predicament gradually and firmly. The ending is a little bit of a let down, it sort of runs home to corporate mama a bit - but it's a compelling watch that gives an early outing to George Kennedy and offers Diane Baker a small opportunity to shine too.",7.0

19728,"***World War I aerial combat from the German perspective***

During World War I a low-class German soldier, Bruno Stachel (George Peppard), transfers from the muddy trenches to the aristocratic air officer corps. Stachel becomes a bit of a fish out of water with his new higher class comrades-in-arms, but this doesn't bother him as Stachel is interested in only one thing: gunning down twenty enemy planes to get the coveted Blue Max, Germany's Medal of Honor. He's so driven that he'll do anything to achieve it, honorably or dishonorably. His success as a fighter pilot prompts a general in Berlin (James Mason) to use him as a propaganda tool, a hero from the lower class who’s ""common as dirt.""

Critics complain that Stachel is unlikable and not a very good hero. It is true that he doesn't seem very friendly, but how friendly would you be with high-class ""gentleman"" after years of brutal trench warfare? It's also true that he's selfishly ambitious and rebels against the team spirit of the squadron, not to mention direct orders. In addition he's an alcoholic and an adulterer. But, as the General states, he's brave ruthless and driven – precisely what Germany needs at the critical juncture of the war in 1918. Stachel isn't a hero, he's an antihero. The story should simply be digested as is without looking for a hero.

One of the best sequences takes place in the first half: Stachel justly feels he is robbed of a ""kill"" because the plane he shot down couldn't officially be confirmed (even after he forces a corporal to escort him around the rainy countryside for half a day to find the downed plane). Later, while escorting an enemy plane back to home base he shoots the plane down when a wounded tailgunner awakens and instinctively starts shooting. Stachel lands and runs over to the downed plane along with numerous other Germans; he cuts the emblem from the plane and bitterly throws it at the feet of his superiors, adamantly stating, ""Confirmed."" This is one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history.

The film is universally praised for its scenic and compelling air combat sequences, but some inexplicably criticize the drama on the ground. Personally, I find the ground story equally as interesting as the air fighting. Besides, how interesting is mindless non-stop action without the contrast of interesting character-defining drama?

Other highlights include a brief appearance of the Red Baron, the ravishing Ursula Undress – I'm sorry, I mean Andress – as the general's adulterous wife and a superb score by Jerry Goldsmith.

The cinematography and Irish locations are excellent. The overall vibe of the film is solemn, dark, dreary and wet; in other words, kind of depressing. But, then, World War I was no happy day at the beach.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Blue Max"" is a film of epic scope, a powerfully realistic portrayal of air combat during World War I. It also ranks with the greatest war films ever made. It may be from 1966 but it's hardly dated.

The runtime is 2 hours, 36 minutes.

19740,"Former World War I pilot Waldo Pepper barnstorms across rural America, giving 5 minute rides to skeptical townsfolk. Clearly the people behind this project love aviation and capture the feel of the post-World-War-I era when ""the sky's the limit"" was literally true. 

The downside of early aviation is shown via the ups and downs of ""Doc Dilhoefer's Flying Circus,"" where a novice wing walker freezes in place. The long arm of the FAA catches up to Waldo because ""it's time that aviation got civilized."" With limited opportunities after being grounded for life, Waldo finds salvation at the movies, where danger is ever-present in the rickety, worn-out planes and fatal stunts for the camera. 

An old nemesis that Waldo missed meeting over France, Ernst Kessler (Ernst Udet?), arrives for the next project--the epic three vs. one dogfight. With the FAA closing in, Waldo's days in the air are numbered, though he's in better shape than the down-at-heels Kessler.

19740,"**_The daredevil barnstormers of the 1920s with Robert Redford and Bo Svenson_**

Two former pilots of WW1 team-up to entertain people in middle America with increasingly risky aerial maneuvers. Susan Sarandon plays a woman who joins the team while Margot Kidder appears as the protagonist’s on-again, off-again girlfriend. Geoffrey Lewis is also on hand as an inspector of the newly formed Air Commerce.

""The Great Waldo Pepper"" (1975) is a tribute to the men & women who risked their lives to entertain people in ‘flying circuses’ in the ’20s through the early ’30s. By the time of this particular story, competition amongst stunt fliers resulted in progressively dangerous tricks, as well as highly publicized accidents, which led to hampering safety regulations and the demise of barnstorming. 

The tone mixes life-or-death drama with amusing bits. There are a couple of shocking sequences that some critics have interpreted as ‘coldhearted,’ but they just reflect those times. Even if you were a female who joined the team, you’re one of the boys and they all knew the risks. Sudden deaths, while unfortunate, didn’t change the fact that it was part of how these people made a living. And the show must go on, as they say.

Speaking of which, if you’re familiar with movies like “The Blue Max,” “Flyboys” and “The Red Baron,” this is what some of the surviving flying aces were doing after the war.

19754,"**_The Fisher / Buttafuoco story with winsome Drew Barrymore as Amy_**

Based on the infamous true story that caused media hysteria in the 90s, a 16 years-old girl (Barrymore) from Long Island foolishly enters into a relationship with a 35 years-old married man, Joey Buttafuoco (Tony Denison), just a few miles from Jones Beach. A year later she confronts his wife at her doorstep (Laurie Paton), shooting her in the side of the head.

“The Amy Fisher Story” was released by ABC on January 3, 1993, just 7.5 months after the shooting. The CBS version was simultaneously aired while the NBC rendition beat both by six days, airing at the end of 1992. Let’s compare the three:

The NBC version, “Amy Fisher: My Story,” aka “Lethal Lolita,” sticks to the bare facts with Amy narrating her experience from a jail cell. While it starts off too by-the-numbers, it becomes compelling in the second half with an outstanding depiction of the front door confrontation between Amy and Mary Jo. It features actors who most resemble their real-life counterparts. Moreover, arrogant Joey’s reasoning to justify his unfaithful actions are superbly presented. 

The CBS interpretation, “Casualties of Love: The Long Island Lolita Story,” features Alyssa Milano in the role of Amy, but supports the Buttafuoco fiction that Joey never had sex with her, which he later admitted was false in light of the glaring evidence (e.g. motel receipts). As such, “Casualties of Love” depicts Joe as an irresistible stud who’s curiously stalked by an attractive girl that imagined their relationship, resulting in the shooting of Mary Jo.

This version by ABC has the star power of Drew Barrymore in the title role, only 17 years-old during filming. It’s based on the chronicling of New York Post writer Amy Pagnozzi (Harley Jane Kozak).

Like “Amy Fisher: My Story,” aka “Lethal Lolita,” I didn’t get the feeling that this version was unbalanced. Fisher’s flaws and foolishness are plainly revealed. A semi-abusive relationship with her father and sexual abuse by an unnamed relative are hinted at as reasons for why she made such bad decisions.

No matter how you slice it, the near fatal shooting that scarred Mary Jo for life, split up two marriages and shattered two families by putting them through hell on earth can be traced to egotistical Joey’s unwise seduction of an underaged girl and ongoing sexual relationship.

This version starts as a compelling coming-age-drama due to Drew’s charisma & beauty and reveals more details about Amy’s situation before meeting Joey. Unfortunately, it bogs down into mechanical storytelling by the second half with a way less effective depiction of the critical confrontation between Amy and Mary jo compared to “Amy Fisher: My Story,” aka “Lethal Lolita.” The latter movie is the exact opposite: It starts weak but ends strong.

If you’re interested in the story and don’t mind television productions, it's best to view both versions since each have their strengths & weaknesses. Disregard the more fictional version with Alyssa Milano unless, of course, you’re an uber-fan of Ms. Milano. 

The film runs 1 hours, 36 minutes, and was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia.

<em>'Son of Flubber'</em> is inferior in every department. I praise the original for its amusing humour, but this film manages to lose it almost entirely. There are a few smirk-worthy moments, but it's mostly stale.

A large reason for that is the lacklustre plot, which isn't ever interesting. The Flubber itself is rarely used, as they instead focus of its ""gas"". The conclusion is, like with the 1961 film, rather dull and adds little.

Fred MacMurray, to his credit, is again good in the role of Prof. Brainard. Nancy Olson (Betsy) and Keenan Wynn (Alonzo) are both involved again, while Tommy Kirk (Biff) is shoehorned into a bigger part; not sure why.

Speaking of forced characters, James Westerfield and Forrest Lewis again appear in the roles of officers Hanson & Kelly; they were, in my opinion, only funny in <em>'The Shaggy Dog'</em>, which these films evidently share the same universe with.

19766,"**A disheartening and very weak film.**

What can happen when a studio like Disney decides to make a sequel to a movie that sold very well, even though it was decimated by critics and has obvious flaws? The result can be better, with the production learning from its mistakes… but in most cases, the end result manages to be even more absurd and dishonorable than the initial film. And that is precisely what happened here!

Inspector Gadget was an amazing cartoon, but it had a brief stint on Portuguese television. I remember him, and I really enjoyed seeing him, but I don't remember seeing him much longer than four or five years. Despite this, it was one of the cartoons that I was most interested in as a child. The 1999 live-action film didn't do it justice... which is not to say it was necessarily bad. It had obvious weaknesses, which were even more glaring when it came to script writing and comic material. This movie, released several years later, is proof that none of this, or almost, was taken seriously, and that Disney only wanted to make money at the expense of fans of the original cartoon.

I've read some specialized critics point out several details of this film to justify their opinion that this film manages to be more faithful to the source material. However, I reserve the right to disagree. Claiming this because the main villain has a cat again and not showing his face is, at the very least, ignoring everything else. The original cartoon was fun, had a sense of entertainment and was designed for children and young people… this movie ignores all of that. A rush-hour shopping trip two days before Christmas Eve can be more fun and exciting than this movie, and anyone who has ever been to a mall on that day knows how unnerving and frustrating that can be.

The movie is not funny, has horrible dialogues and has a terrible script. Basically, it makes Gadget an obsolete and buggy museum piece for most of the movie, and it makes him fall in love with a robot that doesn't even have a nail of humanity. The robot, of course, would be the “new generation” of police officers who would replace him, and who end up leading the manhunt after Claw escapes from prison.

The cast hardly deserves a mention here. The competent and committed Broderick gives way to an inept and tiresome French Stewart. The performance of this actor is simply amateur, and does not do the character any justice. Elaine Hendrix has very little to do. Caitlin Wachs can also complain about the same problem, although she is quite effective and competent in what little she actually does. Tony Martin brought Claw to life, and while many welcome the changes to the character, I feel like she's become more cartoonish here.

Disney invested little in the film: proof of this is the weakness of the visual effects and CGI used, which are clearly cheap and unconvincing. The film's fast pacing subtly seeks to stop audiences from thinking seriously about what they're watching, but I felt that didn't work very well for me because I felt the film was running.

While they're very different movies, I tend to get this mixed up with ""She's Out of My League"".  They're both decent movies, they're funny enough, but they're both forgettable and I don't think you're missing out if you skip either.

My biggest problem with this movie is that there is a wildly violent crime spree throughout the movie.  I'm not talking about simple trespassing, or even under-age drinking (though, I think it applies to my point)  there is physical assault, jokes about ""date-rapey"" behavior, use of cocaine, threats to life, severe destruction of property, forced entry, and I think illegal tracking, quite a bit is just done openly in front of adults / authority figures, and at one point in uniform.  It's one thing to be a little lenient and let kids be kids, but graduating high schoolers are probably 18, adults, and it doesn't make sense to not arrest this idiot.  On top of that, to create a character like that in the moment, then he must have a long history of crimes.

I'm actually a fan of the story, cringey as it may be.  I love an underdog story, and this is a powerful ""coming of age"" story for at least 3 different characters, but as the premise is that it is an unbelievable situation, and they casted and that caste delivered just a little too well.  They specifically don't play well off of each other because the performances are actually so good as characters, and the characters barely mesh, even as the movie continues.

The movie also undercuts the protagonist at the oddest times.  While we're supposed to relate to one of the boys (or possibly Beth Cooper) there are several points where it makes them look even more pathetic or jerks (in her case) and it really takes me out of the movie.  I think it is better to have irredeemable characters than characters that vary on their relate-ability like this movie does.

""The Stepfather"" (2009) is a solid crime drama/thriller with a bit o' slasher horror, a combination of the original film (1987) and its sequel (1989). All of the Stepfather flicks are loosely based on mass murderer John List. They contain elements of movies like ""Psycho"" (1960/1998) mixed with coming-of-age drama, like “Fright Night” (1985) and “Disturbia” (2007). 

Walsh effectively portrays the delusional titular character while Badgley is competent as the teen protagonist. Meanwhile the director takes every opportunity to show Heard in a bikini or underwear, but she’s way too thin to stir much interest despite her obvious attractiveness. She’s more appealing after she acquired some curves, e.g. as Mera in “Aquaman” (2018).

At the end of the day this is an updated, slightly more compelling version of the first film and its sequel. There are just enough changes to make it worthwhile if you’re familiar with the prior flicks. On the downside, it’s a little predictable, but what else is new?

In a time where zombie films and TV shows were starting to come up (The Walking Dead premiered one year later), this post-apocalyptic zombie comedy flick still remains as one of the best zombie movies of the century. Their use quickly became something cliche, and neither funny or scary. Nowadays, people are used to seeing the living dead on the screen all the time, so why does a 2009's film like this still work?

Well, first of all, the outstanding cast is halfway through success. In 2009, only Woody Harrelson was already a renowned adult actor. Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg didn't star in anything truly remarkable yet, so much that Abigail Breslin was more recognizable than them. Even with only 13-years-old, she already had an Oscar nomination in a supporting role (Little Miss Sunshine). However, everyone delivers fantastic performances, which carry the simplistic yet entertaining story to such a success that it became a zombie classic.

Harrelson portraying Tallahassee, the guy who's not scared of anything and likes to ""enjoy the little things"", is one of his career's coolest roles. Eisenberg is not exactly the type of actor I like since he can only do so much with his acting abilities. He always offers the same type of character: a quirky, twitch-full, idiosyncratic personality, which most of the times doesn't work. Contrary to this tendency, Columbus is a character that logically and hilariously fits this model, hence Eisenberg is the movie's primary source of comedy. From his list of rules to his weird behavior, everything feels natural since the character's background justifies his awkward self.

Stone and Breslin share great moments together, as well as Harrelson and Eisenberg, but the former duo has less exciting sequences. Nevertheless, even though the girls could have received more character development, their relationship gives them a compelling reason for us to care about. Wichita might just look like the cliche hot girl who falls for the good guy, but she would do anything to protect her sister, and her love for Little Rock does give her some gravitas. The cast's chemistry is undeniably astonishing. It's visually palpable that they had tons of fun doing this film, and that elevates every single conversation or action scene.

The short runtime allows for a fast-paced story, packed with fun moments, and a lot of bloody zombie killings. The production design is remarkable. Excellent use of practical effects and real sets, plus a perfect soundtrack. Ruben Fleischer knew precisely what he wanted the movie to be, and he never tried to make it something more. Yes, it still involves a romance of sorts, and some backstories might not be funny or joyful. However, it never feels forced or fabricated. It never overextends its stay because Zombieland is neither a romance or a drama. It's purposefully campy, plays with stereotypes creatively, and it's merely 88 minutes of good fun. We are in 2019, and studios forgot how to make films like this!

Every year, there are dozens of blockbusters that would be extremely entertaining if studios would just let them be what they are meant to, but no. They need to have some relevant story that carries a political tone or a social message. Zombieland has all the attributes of a pure blockbuster: a phenomenal cast, a straightforward narrative packed with thrilling sequences, a short runtime with fast pacing, compelling characters, and thousands of zombies. Put together a funny screenplay filled with chuckle-worthy jokes, and you have yourself one of the best zombie movies of the century. It's one of those films which don't exactly have what people address as ""flaws"". Zombieland has its cliches and lazy exposition, but it heavily compensates them with 80 minutes or so of spectacular entertainment. It's a zombie cult classic. Nut up or shut up, but watch the goddamn movie!

19908,"**Zombieland is a hilarious treat for comedy and zombie fans alike.**

Zombieland is a goofy spin on the hordes of zombie movies that came as a result of The Walking Dead’s popularity. It follows a zany cast of characters with big personalities thrust into a post-apocalyptic landscape. However, rather than living in constant fear and survival, it feels as if the characters consider it all another Tuesday. Their motivations are finding twinkies or love rather than escaping death. This tonal twist leads to a very entertaining, self-aware plot that takes funny jabs at traditional zombie tropes. The cast nails this tone as well, with Harrelson, Eisenberg, and Stone all delivering sarcastic yet genuine and caring performances.",8.0
19908,"Jesse Eisenberg does his best Charlton Heston impersonation as ostensibly the last man left on the planet amongst an army of pathologically fed up zombies. His initial narration gives us a little clue as to how he has survived, unbitten, for this long - and just how dangerous it is to use the toilet - before he encounters ""Tallahassee"" (Woody Harrelson) on what's left of the freeway. Convinced they are both still human, they join forces and go off in search of ""Twinkies"" (that's the food variety and not young gay guys!) They find a grocery store where they are quick to rescue ""Wichita"" (Emma Stone) and her twelve year old sister ""Little Rock"" (Abigail Breslin) only to quickly discover that it's now them that needs the rescuing. Some cat and mouse antics now ensue between what is now the last four remaining people, before things settle down for an an hour of comically inspired adventures that sees them seek safety - in the Beverly Hills mansion of Bill Murray for a while, before a denouement in funfair that sees a battle royal commence that's only really missing Ennio Morricone. The four characters here all gel well and with Harrelson on a form that reminded me of why he became famous in ""Cheers"" in the first place, Eisenberg and Stone developing their rapport and the young Breslin looking on with a degree of sagely amusement, this is a fun film. It's well written with plenty of pithy one-liners and plenty of homages to other films and actors who've tackled the zombie theme over the years too. It's nice and short so we've no extended and repetitive combat scenes to bore us, just some short and sweet slaughtering using just about every piece of kit you can imagine (even a food mixer!).",7.0
19912,"It's not actually final...

You can just imagine the suits sitting around their big round table discussing how to churn out another financially beneficial Final Destination movie and get away with it. Big suit number one puts forward that they obviously need more inventive mouse trap like deaths. Big suit number two has the genius notion that 3D is again taking off so why not utilise that option too. And that's pretty much all that it took, with the end result being a movie that is very self aware of its roots, but still plays out as the runt of the Final Destination litter.

Just as the director of the first one, James Wong, was brought back to direct part 3, the makers here bring back the director of part 2, David R. Ellis, to direct part 4! Which ultimately proves to be nothing more than some sort of nepotism like factor because The Final Destination is basically just over 82 minutes of poor acting, bad writing and a series of kills weaved together by the odd 5 minutes of barely relevant characterisations (the exposition as painful as the gory deaths!). 

The kills entertain as they pretty much always have throughout the franchise, with the opening disaster sequences (here set at a speedway stadium) continuing one of the series' great traditions. While the opening and closing X-Ray/Skeletal credit sequences are superb and a credit to those involved. Yet it all feels so tired, where in spite of the willingness to upgrade the technology, it's still lazy and has nothing to really justify its very being other than that to make easy money. 

The makers of part 5 would have to come up with something special to not turn this franchise from being one that was once bright and inventive, into that of a money train joke. 4/10",4.0
19912,"For some reason this one is named The Final Destination instead of Final Destination 4. Almost looks like they expected this installment to be the final in the series but since the 5th one is about to come out on Blu-ray that was obviously a wrong assumption in that case.

A positive surprise. Most people have said that the second third and fourth film slipped compared to the first one and it wasn’t until the fifth film that the series took off again. Well they’re wrong in my opinion.

This installment was a lot better than the third one. Sure if you do not like gory horror movies then you wont like this film but then why did you even bother with it? Me, I like these kind of films so I was quite happy to see it.

The special effects was much better than the previous film and not so silly and stupid as they sometimes where in the third one. I liked the ending as well. Classical horror movie style ending and really cool touch with those x-ray shots.",6.0
19912,"***More of the same, but with one of the better ‘final girls’ and superior music***  

The first ""Final Destination"" movie in 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, an invisible spirit. A group of people, mostly teens, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying the kids who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually an unlikely chain of events. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash, in the second it's a highway pile-up, in the third it's a rollercoaster mishap while in this fourth entry it’s a tragedy at a racetrack. The fifth film (2011) features a bridge collapse.

All of the movies in the five-film franchise tell the same basic story with different characters and minor nuances; all of them are of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on your preference for cast members and the death sequences (and the locations). Other than these factors they're all basically the same.

Released in 2009, ""The Final Destination"" (aka “Final Destination 4”) has a quality redhead heroine in Shantel VanSanten. The director wisely showcases her beauty in a tasteful scene, which none of the previous movies managed to accomplish. Haley Webb and Krista Allen are also on hand in the feminine department. The previous film arguably has the best assortment of women in the series.

While it’s true that you know exactly how this film plays out if you've seen the first three installments, or any of them, there are some highlights beyond the females.  For one, this movie has the best music yet, whether score or soundtrack. The opening tragedy is thrilling as usual and there are several creative death or near-death scenes involving a tow truck, a pool, a car wash, a cinema and an escalator.

The film runs 93 minutes and is the only installment that wasn’t filmed in the Vancouver area. The entire movie was shot in the East as follows: The speedway sequences were filmed in Mobile, Alabama; the closing mall scenes in McKinley, Pennsylvania; other scenes & studio work in New Orleans/Harahan, Louisiana; and reshoots in Orlando, Florida.

<em>'(500) Days of Summer'</em> impressed me. It features a fairly unique and a pretty refreshing romcom story, which is told in an interesting way.

19913,"I recently had the opportunity to watch this movie again, many years removed from the first time I saw it. I was surprised how few details I remembered.

During the movie’s sharpest moments, the dialogue is witty and fun. The story bounces around back and forth along the 500 day timeline they have measured out for the relationship between the two main characters. The device works; we get to see the state of their couple-ness at various points. It is, most of the time entertaining.

But I have to say, as much as I like Zooey in her role (and this time around I know her from her great work in Elf), I was less than dazzled by our hero. I found him to be rather pathetic and despite the fun the two characters shared at times, it felt to me there was not much chemistry between the two, except when Zooey’s character exerted herself in his direction. Perhaps that was intended, given the arc of the plot.

As I said above, the movie was entertaining, but ultimately I wasn’t satisfied with the ending. How it turned out for both characters, while believable when looked at from afar, came across as sudden and a little lame. More groundwork should have be laid out for where they stood at the end.",6.0
19959,"Surrogacy is a perversion. It's an addiction. And you have to kill the addict to kill the addiction. 

I first viewed Surrogates upon its home format release and positively found it very ordinary. Viewing it again, with focus and in solitude, it proved to be a far better experience.

The action scenes are what you would expect for a multi-plex appeasing popcorner, loud, colourful and owing great debt to modern technology. Yet to dismiss this totally as one of those easy money making blockbuster movies is most unfair.

Surrogates oozes intrigue, even if it doesn't quite deliver on the smartness written on the page. The idea that in the future robotic alter egos can carry out our everyday mundane functions is cracker-jack, and it opens up a whole can of berserker worms. 

This is not merely an excuse to have Bruce Willis running around exploding surrogate robots, as much fun as that is of course, there's a deeper emotional core pulsing away as Willis fights the good fight to make sure being human is not cast aside like a thing of the past, that as flawed as we are, hiding away in a surrogate is not the answer.

This axis of the story is beautifully realised by the plot strand involving Willis and Rosamund Pike as his wife, with both actors doing fine work to give it the required emotional heft. It may ultimately lose itself to a standard conspiracy plot, but there's intelligence within to make Surrogates a better film than it first appears. 7/10",7.0
19959,"Surrogates (2009) takes an interesting concept, people living through robotic avatars, and turns it into a straightforward action thriller. The plot is easy to follow, with a few twists along the way, but it never really digs deep into the bigger questions it could have explored. The movie has a polished look, and the visual effects for the surrogates are decent for the time, making them feel just artificial enough. The directing keeps the pacing tight, but the script doesn't do much beyond moving the story from one action scene to the next. There's a moment or two where it tries to be thought-provoking, but it doesn’t fully commit.

Bruce Willis does what he always does, playing the tough, weary protagonist, but there’s not much character depth to work with. The supporting cast does fine, but nothing really stands out. Ving Rhames' presence adds some weight to the film, but the dialogue overall is just serviceable. The score is typical for an action thriller, doing its job without being memorable. The cinematography is solid, with some good action sequences, but it doesn’t do anything particularly unique. The movie is entertaining enough, but if you were hoping for something as layered as I, Robot, this one doesn’t quite reach that level. Still, it’s a decent watch if you're in the mood for a simple, action-driven sci-fi flick.",5.0

Egomaniac publisher Earl Janoth (Charles Laughton) murders his mistress in a fit of temper. He then uses all his power and connections to pin the crime on another man seen close to the crime. George Stroud (Ray Milland), editor of Janoth's own Crimeways magazine, is put in charge of tracing the mystery man. Which is fine until he finds that as he digs deeper, all the evidence points to he himself being the fall guy! 

Ostensibly film noir it may be, but The Big Clock still has something to offer even the most casual of cinema goer. Directed by the still criminally undervalued John Farrow, The Big Clock has a touch of the Alfred Hitchcock ""wrong man"" theme about it. Based on a novel written by Kenneth Fearing, Farrow and his writer, Jonathan Latimer, have managed to craft a piece that is both twisty and unique in its execution. With both things working towards a quite clever and suspenseful ending. 

As with the best of film noir, The Big Clock has an intricate plot that's awash with dubious characters and sexual ambiguity. Headed by Laughton's tyrannical philandering Janoth (apparently based on real life publisher Henry Luce), the piece boasts what maybe a gay scar-faced right hand man? (George Macready) and a butch masseur henchman (Harry Morgan playing against type). Only in the wonderful world of film noir can such characters not only exist, but also be so riveting within the film's structure. The piece is also very funny, particularly when Elsa Lanchester's batty artist Louise Patterson is on the screen. I almost fell off my chair laughing during one scene as she hands in a sketch of the wanted man, Picasso would have been proud! 

But ultimately it's the story and Ray Milland's ability to see it through that wins the day. Even with the odd little problem, such as the underusing of Maureen O' Sullivan as Stroud's wife, Georgette, thus the domestic strife feels like filler. The Big Clock still finishes as an excellently constructed picture containing interesting thematics on time (this will be down to the individual viewer) that's cunningly set in amongst a media empire environment. Remade with some success in 1987 as a political thriller (No Way Out), The Big Clock still remains the essential film to see. Crime, mystery, drama, comedy and a thriller, it has a little for everyone, even if it is basically a film noir treat. 9/10",9.0
19994,"PMS isn't real Needy, it was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem like we're crazy. 

Jennifer's Body is directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Diablo Cody. It stars Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, J.K. Simmons, Andy Sedaris and Adam Brody. Music is by Stephen Barton and Thodore Shapiro and cinematography by M. David Mullen. Plot finds Fox as a High School cheerleader who gets possessed by a demon and starts eating the boys from school. Seyfried is the homely best friend who tries to stop her.

Women impacting on the horror genre from the directing or writing chairs is in short supply, sadly the team-up of Diablo Cody and Karyn Kusama has barely made a stain on this issue. The intentions, you feel, were honourable from the outset, an attempt to blend hip pop culture comedy with demonic horror, wrapped around the perils of High School sexual learnings, unfortunately the final product is decidedly tepid. Neither funny, bloody or scary, and with weak CGI into the bargain, film feels confused in trying to cover so many bases. The High School setting is lazy, Kusama isn't able to build suspense and Cody's writing misses the required emotional beats. Cast are fine, the odd gag scores some giggles and the film is often sexy, while the score literally does rock, but all told it's just too messy, too studio safe for its own good. 5/10",5.0
19994,"Rewatching Jennifer's Body reminds me why it left such an impression the first time around. The opening narration paired with the ""before and after"" sequence was a brilliant way to introduce the characters and set the tone for what was to come. It strikes a balance between ominous and quirky, pulling you into the strange, twisted world of Devil’s Kettle.

Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried’s chemistry is one of the highlights. Their dynamic as Jennifer and Needy feels authentic, charged with tension, and full of layers. Megan Fox, often criticized for her emotional range, really brought something extra to this role. She captures Jennifer’s dangerous allure and underlying insecurities in a way that makes her both menacing and fascinating. And let’s be honest—Fox’s charisma and screen presence are off the charts here.

What I like is that the movie has more going on under the surface. Sure, it’s about a demon-possessed cheerleader eating boys, but there’s also stuff about friendship, jealousy, and even how women are underestimated or exploited. There’s a lot of deeper meaning if you take the time to think about it (or look it up online, let’s be honest).

The production overall was pretty good. The locations were well chosen, and the cinematography had some cool details, like those subtle shifts in perspective with handheld shots and close-ups. It really added to the tension without being too flashy.

For me, Jennifer’s Body is one of those movies that just works. It’s fun, has great performances, and leaves you thinking a bit more than you’d expect from a horror-comedy. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely worth a rewatch—and yeah, Megan Fox totally owned this one.",8.0

So here it is then, what has been in gestation in James Cameron's mind for over 12 years finally hit the silver screen towards the back end of 2009. Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I'm forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being.

No doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don't really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There's also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film's, Dances *cough* With *cough* Wolves *cough* It's as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn't as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He's like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal.

19995,"This is another of these films for which I didn't get the memo. It undoubtedly has parallels with the ecological ravaging of Earth by mankind, but for the most part it is just a fairly standard action romance that owes much of it's significance to it being an outstanding technical production. Sam Worthington is ""Jake"", a paraplegic solider who is tasked with assisting on a mission on a distant planet. By way of a bribe, the authorities offer him surgery to restore his mobility if he uses an avatar machine to infiltrate the folks inhabiting the planet ""Pandora"". The more he explores this bright new world, the more he begins to integrate with the people and their beautiful and colourful environment. His affection for ""Neytiri"" (Zoe Saldana) and his gradually developing appreciation of just what his mission is about, sets him up for a serious conflict with the gung-ho militaristic ""Quaritch"" (Stephen Lang). This film is all about corporate greed and an horrendous disregard not just for nature, but for an indigenous population that is though frequently touching, let down by a really mediocre cast, some slightly pontificating dialogue and yes, it is really too long.

Niagara Falls, so often a place of honeymoon love is the setting for this engrossing and gripping thriller directed with tight astuteness by the brilliant Henry Hathaway. Hathaway works from a screenplay collectively written by Charles Brackett, Walter Reisch and Richard L. Breen. It stars Joseph Cotton, Marilyn Monroe, Jean Peters, Max Showalter (as Casey Adams), Denis O'Dea and Richard Allan. Music is by Sol Kaplan and cinematography by Joseph MacDonald.

Plot wise it's very simple, the core essence that of an unfaithful wife scheming against her husband - thus garnering peril ire from the jealously unstable man -  but simplicity of plot does not stop this from reaching craftily high peaks. Hathaway and MacDonald breathtakingly weave the splendid location into the unfolding story, something that simultaneously brings out the sensual beauty of the two lovely leading ladies, with the sense of danger still always as a constant factor. The framing of man made structures such as staircases and the bell tower are readily given a noir vibe, again enhancing a story pungent with human fallibilities and dripping wet metaphors.

Now that the film is readily available in restored home formats, one gets to see the sublime work of MacDonald. The Technicolour photography has a lurid broody sheen to it, thus enhancing the disquiet mood pulsing away in the story and that of Monroe's sensuality within it. Peters (a true classic beauty), in what is the toughest part, doesn't let her character become secondary to Monroe's (even more impressive given Monroe's fine work and Hathaway's lingering usage of her), so much so that when the edge of the seat finale arrives we the audience are fully immersed in it. While Cotten as the tortured husband to Monroe's adulterous wife nails the duality of the character for maximum returns.

‘The Big Steal’, starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer and scripted by Geoffrey Holmes (Daniel Mainwaring) often appears to be best known and least admired for what it isn’t, namely ‘Out of the Past’.

The latter, released in 1947 - starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer and scripted by Geoffrey Holmes - is regarded as an elegant and sublime evocation of noir. The ‘Big Steal’ is hardly referenced and not much regarded at all.

Standing in the shadow of ‘Out of the Past’, it’s understandable that the ‘The Big Steal’ seems overlooked and/ or underestimated. At just 71 minutes long, it’s a much shorter, slighter movie and nothing like as darkly noir nor as ‘memorable’.

However, slighter doesn’t mean lesser as far as the pleasure that can be had from it. Even if it is the sorry stepchild of the “Out of the Past’, ‘The Big Steal’ is a very easy film to like.

For a start, it’s unabashed fun. Even Bosley Crowther, the high-toned windbag who held the film desk forever at the New York Times found the movie amiable. Here’s an excerpt from his especially garrulous review, July 11, 1949:


‘A breath-taking scenic excursion across the landscape of Mexico…through villages, on lovely open roads and over towering mountains on switchback highways at a fast and sizzling pace’.
‘Seems that a certain tricky fellow, whom Patric Knowles suavely enacts, is trying to escape into the interior of Mexico from Vera Cruz with a load of swag. Seems that his stubborn pursuer is a curious laconic gent played by Robert Mitchum who is accompanied by a lady, prettily played by Jane Greer. Seems that another desperate party, William Bendix is after both and a Mexican police inspector, Ramon Novarro is tailing the lot’.
‘Just where and why they are fleeing is rather loosely and unsatisfactorily explained but obviously they are not friendly people for whenever any of them get together they usually fight. But that is not important and we casually advise that you try not to follow too closely the involution of the plot’.


Well, there you have it. He’s done up the story, set the scene, captured the mood, and casually advised. Why, I could stop right here.

Except there’s further a job to be done and that’s to plead a decent case for ‘The Big Steal’ as a film noir - at least enough of one for it to be able to sit facing the Blackboard without shame.

Let’s start with the issue of ‘The Big Steal’s easy disposition.

Though it’s true that the movie has a much sunnier way about it than you would expect to find in noir, there’s also some really bad stuff going on here.

Lt. Duke Halliday (Mitchum) has been framed for a robbery and is in pursuit of the real thief, Jim Fiske (Knowles). The problem is that Halliday too is now on the run, from his senior officer, Cpt. Vincent Blake (Bendix) whose reasons for chasing Halliday turn out to be not as straightforward as they seem.

Ultimately, it’s going to be Blake’s duplicity and betrayal that qualify the movie as solid noir. But meanwhile, the disillusioned Halliday proves himself to be no saint as he goes around dishing out the mayhem.

The ‘Big Steal’ also covers some of the same disarranged narrative and thematic territory as a number of later films by its director, Don Siegel. In both ‘Madigan’ and ‘Dirty Harry’, for example, cops are driven to defy institutional authority and constraints in an effort to see that justice is done. Siegel in these films actually disavows much difference between hero and villain, with justice often ceding to vengeance.

While Halliday is military and not police, he still takes the law upon himself because of the box in which he’s found himself. Like other of Siegel’s protagonists, he doesn’t let a whole lot in his way.

The thing about Siegel is that while he frames some interesting moral and ethical dilemmas, he seldom allows his characters to hang around for very long to dwell on them. He’d rather cut straight to the chase - literally - and as a former film editor and second-unit director, knows how to handle the action.

‘The Big Steal’ is noir-on-a-tear, a raggedy little B-feature built for speed with everyone going along for the ride. No wonder. Screenwriter Holmes/ Mainwaring gifts Mitchum and Greer with as much keen, noir-induced dialogue and as many slippery story twists as you could hope for.

Mitchum and Greer make a great screen twosome but this time it’s Greer who really gets to show her stuff. As note-prefect as she was as Cathie Moffat in “Out of the Past’, director Jacques Tourneur really didn’t give her much more than just that one note to play as an impassive, amoral femme fatale.

There’s nothing impassive or fatale about her in the ‘The Big Steal’. Her Joan ‘Chiquita’ Graham is also chasing down Fiske, who’s supposed to be her fiancé but who has taken her for more than her virtue. But Greer’s got nothing but spunk, is at least as much on the ball as Mitchum and is no easier about hooking up with him as he is with her in order to reel Fiske in.

The wonderful stroppiness of the relationship Holmes has scripted out for them brings out the best in both actors. Mitchum is lively and Greer delivers the most appealing performance of her career (interestingly, she came late to the production, replacing Lizabeth Scott, who was taken off the production because of Mitchum’s arraignment on a marijuana rap).

‘The Big Steal’ is a thoroughly high-spirited effort but shouldn’t be dismissed as just a breezy comedy-suspenser and a no-account noir because of it. While contrived humor can be poisonous to film noir, that‘s not ‘The Big Steal’s problem because Seigel avoids it. He’s no smirky Hitchcock.

While ‘Private Hell 36’ is probably Siegel’s truest classic noir, ‘The Big Steal’ shows more than enough of noirland’s darkened surface features - icons Mitchum and Bendix, a story washed dark with bad luck, betrayal, greed and corruption and a resonant exchange of tough words and hard fists,

‘The Big Steal’ gives big enjoyment and good noir both. Lie back and enjoy.

20000,"""Taylor"" (John Hodiak) returns from a war-torn Europe after WWII disfigured and suffering from memory loss. Gradually, as his amnesia starts to fade, he recalls the name of one man who might be able to help him get back on his feet so sets off to Los Angeles to find him. Pretty quickly he discovers that this isn't going to be an easy task - and it's only after he is beaten and dumped outside the door of ""Christy"" (Nancy Guild) that he regales his story and then she decides to get him introduced to police lieutenant ""Kendall"" (Lloyd Nolan). This is where the story starts to hot up. It seems his friend (""Cravat"") was caught up in what appears to be some postwar Nazi money laundering/smuggling and it's a race against time to find the cash before it's gone along with a likely murderer. The largely B-list cast all work quite well here. Nobody is trying to outshine the other and so that allows the solid story to develop and play out properly. It's not just a routine crime drama, there are a few twists and the paucity of characters on screen allows for more of them to become a little more substantial as we progress through this intriguing investigation to quite an exciting denouement. It's maybe just ten minutes too long, it takes a while to build up steam - but still, if you like the genre, it's at the better end and worth a watch.",7.0
